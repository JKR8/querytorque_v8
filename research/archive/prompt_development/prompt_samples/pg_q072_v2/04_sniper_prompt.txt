You are a senior SQL optimization architect for PostgreSQL v14.3. You have FULL FREEDOM to design your own approach — you are NOT constrained to any specific DAG topology or CTE structure. The analyst's strategy guidance below is ADVISORY, not mandatory.

Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — guards prevent silent breakage. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from output.

## Target: >=2.0x speedup

Your target is >=2.0x speedup on this query. This is the bar. Anything below 2.0x is a miss.

## Previous Optimization Attempts
Target: **>=2.0x** | 4 workers tried | none reached target

| Worker | Strategy | Speedup | Status | Error |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| W1 ★ | star_join_prefetch | 1.15x | NEUTRAL |  |
| W4 | exploration_novel | 0.92x | REGRESSION |  |
| W2 | decorrelate_subquery | 0.85x | REGRESSION | Row count mismatch: expected 142, got 198 |
| W3 | scan_consolidation | 0.0x | ERROR | syntax error at or near 'FILTER' (line 12) |


## Best Foundation SQL

The best previous result. You may build on this or start fresh.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1998
)
SELECT i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
FROM catalog_sales cs
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
-- ... rest of query
```

## Failure Synthesis (from diagnostic analyst)

W1 achieved 1.15x via date CTE isolation — the only passing approach. The bottleneck is the nested-loop join between filtered catalog_sales and inventory (non-equi condition inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity). W2 broke semantic equivalence by decorrelating a non-correlated subquery path. W3 used PG-unsupported FILTER syntax. W4's novel approach didn't reduce the critical join input cardinality.

## Unexplored Angles

No worker attempted to pre-aggregate or pre-filter inventory. The EXPLAIN shows inventory is scanned fully (11M rows) for each probe. Pre-filtering inventory by the d_week_seq range (only ~7 weeks in 1998) would reduce the join input from 11M to ~1.5M rows.

## Strategy Guidance (ADVISORY — not mandatory)

1. Keep W1's date CTE isolation (proven 1.15x). 2. Add inventory pre-filtering: join inventory with the same date CTE to restrict to relevant weeks, reducing from 11M to ~1.5M rows. 3. Then join filtered_cs with filtered_inventory on (item_sk, quantity < condition). This reduces the nested-loop from 170K×11M to 170K×1.5M — a ~7x reduction in join work.

## Example Adaptation Notes

pg_date_cte_explicit_join: APPLY the date CTE isolation pattern (proven by W1). IGNORE the explicit join conversion — PG already uses explicit joins.
pg_dimension_prefetch_star: APPLY the multi-dimension prefetch concept, adapted for INVENTORY pre-filtering. IGNORE the star-join aspect — Q072 is not a star join.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"
from
   catalog_sales
  ,warehouse
  ,ship_mode
  ,call_center
  ,date_dim
where
d_month_seq between 1193 and 1193 + 23
and cs_ship_date_sk   = d_date_sk
and cs_warehouse_sk   = w_warehouse_sk
and cs_ship_mode_sk   = sm_ship_mode_sk
and cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
and cs_list_price between 271 and 300
and sm_type = 'REGULAR'
and cc_class = 'small'
and w_gmt_offset = -5
group by
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1216
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name, SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days", ... FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 AND sm_type = 'REGULAR' AND cc_class = 'small' AND w_gmt_offset = -5 GROUP BY SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

```

## Hazard Flags

- Do NOT attempt FILTER clause syntax — PG 14.3 supports it but W3's error suggests a syntax context issue. Use CASE WHEN instead.
- The non-equi join (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity) CANNOT be converted to hash join. Keep as nested-loop but reduce input cardinality.
- Preserve LEFT JOINs to promotion and catalog_returns.

## Engine Profile

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)
- **BITMAP_OR_SCAN**: Multi-branch OR conditions on indexed columns are handled via BitmapOr — a single fact table scan with bitmap combination. Extremely efficient.
- **SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination. Stops scanning after the first match per outer row.
- **INNER_JOIN_REORDERING**: PostgreSQL freely reorders INNER JOINs based on estimated selectivity. The cost model works well for explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
- **INDEX_ONLY_SCAN**: When an index covers all requested columns, PostgreSQL reads only the index without touching the heap.
- **PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION**: PostgreSQL parallelizes large scans and aggregations across worker processes with partial aggregation finalization.
- **JIT_COMPILATION**: PostgreSQL JIT-compiles complex expressions and tuple deforming for long-running queries.

### Optimizer Gaps (opportunities)
- **COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS**: Implicit comma-separated FROM tables (FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.id = t2.id) are treated as cross products initially. The cost model is significantly weaker on comma-joins than on explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  Opportunity: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. This alone can unlock 2-3x improvements. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
    + Q080: 3.32x — comma-joins to explicit JOINs + date CTE on multi-channel UNION query
    + Q099: 2.28x — same pattern on star schema
    + Q054: 1.14x — JOIN conversion alone
- **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS**: Cannot automatically decorrelate complex correlated subqueries. Correlated scalar subqueries with aggregates are executed as nested-loop with repeated evaluation.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
    + Q092: 4428x — timeout recovery. Unbounded correlated subquery converted to explicit JOIN.
    + Q032: 391x — same pattern, timeout to sub-second.
- **NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS**: Cannot pre-filter fact tables before non-equi join operations (date arithmetic, range comparisons, quantity < quantity). Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which is O(N*M).
  Opportunity: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
    + Q072: 2.68x — pre-filtered catalog_sales by wholesale_cost range before non-equi quantity comparison with inventory. Reduced nested-loop input by ~70%.
- **CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE**: PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default (multi-referenced) or by choice (AS MATERIALIZED). This creates a hard optimization fence — no predicate pushdown from outer query into CTE. This makes CTE-based strategies a double-edged sword on PG.
  Opportunity: Use materialization STRATEGICALLY: materialize when the CTE is expensive and reused multiple times. Avoid CTEs that fence off predicate pushdown for single-use cases.
    + Q065: 1.95x — strategic materialization prevented redundant fact table scan multiplication
- **CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS**: Same gap as DuckDB but WORSE on PostgreSQL because CTE materialization fence makes it more impactful. Predicates in the outer WHERE cannot propagate into materialized CTEs.
  Opportunity: Same as DuckDB: pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious — only when the CTE is clearly suboptimal.
    + Q080: 3.32x — date filter + comma-join conversion (the combo is key)
    + Q099: 2.28x — date CTE with explicit JOIN

## Correctness Invariants (HARD STOPS — non-negotiable)

These 4 constraints are absolute. Even with full creative freedom, you may NEVER violate these:

- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: Correctness gate: Literal Preservation
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: Correctness gate: Semantic Equivalence
- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: Correctness gate: Complete Output
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: Correctness gate: Cte Column Completeness

## Aggregation Semantics Check (HARD STOP)

- STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — changing group membership changes the result.
- AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe.
- FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
- Verify aggregation equivalence for ANY proposed restructuring.

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

## System Resource Envelope

Memory budget: shared_buffers=4GB, effective_cache_size=12GB
Global work_mem: 128MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~10 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 512MB per-op)
Storage: SSD (random_page_cost=1.1)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=4

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### Output Format
If you recommend SET LOCAL, prefix your SQL block with the commands:

```sql
SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB';
SET LOCAL jit = 'off';
-- rewritten query follows
WITH ...
SELECT ...
```

If no config changes help, just output the rewritten SQL directly.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_DAG` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_desc`
  2. `w_warehouse_name`
  3. `d_week_seq`
  4. `no_promo`
  5. `promo`
  6. `total_cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
  e.g., 'Consolidated 4 store_sales scans into 1 with CASE branches — reduces I/O by 3x'
  e.g., 'Deferred customer join to resolve_names — joins 4K rows instead of 5.4M'
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
