  "explanation": "Pushed the date_dim join and date range filter (d_date BETWEEN '2000-08-19' AND '2000-08-19' + 14 days) down into each branch of the UNION ALL within ssr and csr CTEs. This reduces the data volume early by filtering store_sales/store_returns and catalog_sales/catalog_returns before the UNION ALL and aggregation operations, avoiding scanning data outside the date range."
