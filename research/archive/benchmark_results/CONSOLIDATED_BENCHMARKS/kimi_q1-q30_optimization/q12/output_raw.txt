  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to push the i_category predicate down to the item table and the date range predicate down to the date_dim table before joining. This reduces the cardinality of the joins significantly by filtering base tables early. Also pruned unnecessary columns in intermediate CTEs (projection_prune) to minimize memory usage during query execution."
