  "explanation": "Split the OR condition (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') into two separate UNION ALL branches, each filtering on one promotion channel predicate. Pushed down the d_year = 2001 filter into a separate date CTE for early filtering. This allows the optimizer to use indexes on individual promotion channel columns and avoids the OR predicate overhead during the join operations."
