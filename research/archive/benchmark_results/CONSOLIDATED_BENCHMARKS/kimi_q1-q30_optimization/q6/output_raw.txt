  "explanation": "Decorrelated the scalar subquery on date_dim by converting it to a CTE (target_month) and joining, eliminating the per-row subquery execution. Decorrelated the correlated subquery on item category by pre-computing average prices per category with threshold multiplier in CTE (category_avg), then joining on i_category and moving the inequality predicate to the WHERE clause. This transforms two subqueries into joins, enabling hash joins instead of nested loop correlated execution."
