  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary joins to the store dimension table from both [ss] and [sr] CTEs. Since the queries only select s_store_sk (the join key) and aggregate measures, and do not filter on or select any other store attributes, the join is redundant. The foreign key ss_store_sk/sr_store_sk from the fact tables provides the same grouping key, eliminating the need to join with the store table while preserving output schema and semantics."
