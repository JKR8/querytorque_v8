  "explanation": "Factored out the date_dim filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1183 AND 1194) into a single CTE to avoid redundant scanning and filtering of the dimension table three times. Applied projection pruning to ensure only necessary columns (c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date) are carried through the joins and distinct operations. This reduces I/O and memory pressure during the INTERSECT operations."
