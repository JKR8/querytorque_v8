  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to push i_category predicate down to item table and date range predicate down to date_dim table before joins. This reduces the cardinality of the join inputs significantly. Also applied projection_prune implicitly by selecting only necessary columns in the filtered CTEs (e.g., only d_date_sk needed from date_dim after filtering, only relevant item columns). The window function is preserved as-is since it requires the aggregated results partitioned by i_class."
