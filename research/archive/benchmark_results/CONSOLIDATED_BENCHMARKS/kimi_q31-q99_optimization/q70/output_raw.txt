This allows early termination once a matching state is found in the top-5 ranking, rather than materializing the full subquery result set. Aliased subquery tables (ss2, s2, d2) to avoid ambiguity with outer query tables while preserving the identical filter logic (d_month_seq range and join conditions)."
