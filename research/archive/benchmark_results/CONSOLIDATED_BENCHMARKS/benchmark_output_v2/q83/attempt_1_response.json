  "explanation": "Extracted the repeated date filtering subquery pattern (d_date IN (SELECT...)) from wr_items and sr_items into a shared CTE (filtered_dates). This eliminates redundant computation of the same date filtering logic across multiple CTEs. The original nested subqueries for week_seq lookup are also materialized into a separate CTE (target_weeks) for clarity and potential reuse. This follows QT-OPT-007 (Materialize Repeated Subquery) pattern."
