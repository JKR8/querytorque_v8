Looking at this query, I can see a clear opportunity to apply date_cte_isolate. The query filters date_dim on d_year=2002 AND d_moy=12 and joins with store_sales. By isolating the filtered date dimension into a CTE first, we can reduce the size of the join significantly.

  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",
      "nodes": {

        "main_query": "SELECT fd.d_year, i.i_brand_id AS brand_id, i.i_brand AS brand, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk WHERE i.i_manager_id = 1 GROUP BY fd.d_year, i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id ORDER BY fd.d_year, ext_price DESC, brand_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same column output",

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce join size. The original query scans entire date_dim table and joins with store_sales before filtering. By creating filtered_dates CTE first, we only join store_sales with the 31 rows (December 2002) instead of all 73,049 date_dim rows. This reduces hash join cost significantly."
