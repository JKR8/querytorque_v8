  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filters into separate CTEs and pushed them early into fact table joins. Each date_dim table is scanned once with its filter, then joined to the respective fact table. This reduces the volume of data in the main joins by filtering store_sales, store_returns, and catalog_sales early using the date predicates."
