## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",

        "filtered_sales": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

## Example: OR to UNION ALL (OR_TO_UNION)
Verified speedup: 3.17x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', ...)
       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.98x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Each OR branch becomes a separate query with focused predicates. Date filter is extracted as CTE and joined into each branch.

## Example: Filter Pushdown (PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.11x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) > 2972190 
  THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20)
  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
  ...
FROM reason WHERE r_reason_sk = 1

      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same aggregation results",
        "same output columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.11x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)

Now output your rewrite_sets:
