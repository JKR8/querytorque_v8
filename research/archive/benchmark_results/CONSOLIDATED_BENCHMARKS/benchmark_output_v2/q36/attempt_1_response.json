Looking at this query, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The `date_dim` table is filtered by `d_year = 2002` and joined to `store_sales`. This can be isolated into a CTE to reduce the join size early.

2. **Store Filter Pushdown**: The `store` table has a predicate on `s_state IN (...)` that can be pushed down into a CTE.

3. **Materialization Opportunity**: The query performs complex calculations (ratios, window functions) on aggregated data. Pre-aggregating in CTEs could help.

Here's my optimized version:

  "explanation": "1) Created filtered_dates CTE to isolate date_dim scan with d_year=2002 predicate, reducing join size early. 2) Created filtered_stores CTE to push down s_state IN (...) predicate. 3) Created sales_aggregates CTE to pre-aggregate store_sales data at (ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk) granularity with the two filtered CTEs joined early, reducing the fact table size before joining with item. 4) Main query now operates on pre-aggregated data, computing ratios and window functions on smaller dataset. This reduces the heavy join between large fact table (store_sales) and dimension tables."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. **Early filtering**: By creating `filtered_dates` and `filtered_stores` CTEs, we push predicates down before the expensive joins.
2. **Pre-aggregation**: The `sales_aggregates` CTE aggregates at the `(ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk)` level early, which reduces the data volume significantly before joining with the `item` table.
3. **Reduced join complexity**: The original query had a 4-table join with complex filtering. The rewrite creates a pipeline where each step reduces data volume before the next operation.
4. **Preserved semantics**: The rewrite maintains all window functions, grouping, and ordering exactly as in the original query.

The expected speedup comes from:
- Reducing `store_sales` scan from ~34M rows to only those matching date and store filters
- Aggregating early to reduce join cardinality with `item` table
- Each CTE can be scanned once and potentially materialized for reuse
