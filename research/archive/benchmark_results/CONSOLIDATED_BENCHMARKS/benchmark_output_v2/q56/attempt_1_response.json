  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: (1) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE: Extracted date filter and customer_address filter into separate CTEs to allow early filtering and reduce join sizes. The date_dim scan is reduced from 73,049 rows to ~29 rows, and customer_address from 9M to ~441K rows. (2) MATERIALIZE_CTE: Extracted repeated item subquery into a CTE to avoid repeated scans of the item table. Both optimizations work together to reduce the largest cost centers: store_sales scan (64.9% cost) and item scans (6 scans in original query)."
