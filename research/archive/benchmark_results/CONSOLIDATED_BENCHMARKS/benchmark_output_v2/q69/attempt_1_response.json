  "explanation": "The original query had three correlated subqueries (EXISTS/NOT EXISTS) scanning store_sales, web_sales, and catalog_sales with date_dim joins. Rewritten to: 1) Isolate date range into CTE (date_cte_isolate), 2) Precompute distinct customers for each sales channel in that date range, 3) Replace correlated subqueries with IN/NOT IN against precomputed sets. This eliminates repeated scanning of fact tables and date_dim for each customer row."
