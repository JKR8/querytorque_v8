  "explanation": "Pushed filters on dimension tables (time_dim, household_demographics, store) into CTEs before joining with large fact table store_sales. This reduces the 34.5M row store_sales scan by applying dimension filters early, allowing the optimizer to use indexed lookups or smaller hash tables. The filtered dimension tables are tiny (1,800, 720, and 55 rows respectively) compared to the original sequential scans."
