Looking at this query, I see three main opportunities:

1. **Multiple date_dim scans**: The same date filter (d_year=2002 and d_moy=11) is applied in each UNION branch
2. **Correlated EXISTS subqueries** in cross_items_flat
3. **Redundant IN subqueries** in main query branches

Let me focus on the most impactful rewrite: decorrelating the EXISTS subqueries in cross_items_flat and pushing filters earlier.

  "explanation": "This rewrite decorrelates the EXISTS subqueries in cross_items_flat by pre-computing filtered sets of item_sk for each sales channel using the same date filter. It also creates a shared filtered_dates CTE to avoid redundant date_dim scans. The main query joins are simplified and should benefit from smaller intermediate results."
