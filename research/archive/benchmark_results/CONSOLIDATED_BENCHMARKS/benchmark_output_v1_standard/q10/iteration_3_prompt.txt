## Example: Materialize Repeated Subquery (MATERIALIZE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.5-2.0x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count,
       SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping
FROM web_sales ws1, date_dim, customer_address, web_site
WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01'
  AND ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state = 'IL'
  AND ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_returns wr1 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number)

### Output:
```json

      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "materialize_cte",
      "nodes": {

        "returned_orders": "SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns",
        "main_query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL"

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract the EXISTS subquery into a CTE that finds multi-warehouse orders ONCE. Extract returned orders into another CTE. Join instead of nested EXISTS checks.

## Example: Multi-layer Predicate Pushdown (MULTI_PUSH_PREDICATE)
Verified speedup: 1.3-2.0x

### Input:
[cte_inner]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales

[cte_outer]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM cte_inner GROUP BY ss_customer_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT * FROM cte_outer WHERE ss_customer_sk IN (SELECT c_customer_sk FROM customer WHERE c_birth_country = 'UNITED STATES')

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "multi_push_predicate",
      "nodes": {
        "target_customers": "SELECT c_customer_sk FROM customer WHERE c_birth_country = 'UNITED STATES'",
        "cte_inner": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN target_customers ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM cte_inner GROUP BY ss_customer_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.6x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** The customer filter in main_query should be pushed through cte_outer into cte_inner to filter store_sales EARLY. Extract filter to CTE and join at base table.

## Example: Filter Pushdown (PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.44x

### Input:
[inv]:
SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, cov
FROM (SELECT ... FROM inventory JOIN date_dim WHERE d_year = 1998 GROUP BY ...) foo
WHERE stdev/mean > 1

[main_query]:
SELECT ... FROM inv inv1, inv inv2
WHERE inv1.d_moy = 1 AND inv2.d_moy = 2 ...

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "pushdown",
      "nodes": {
        "inv": "SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN NULL ELSE stdev/mean END AS cov FROM (SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, STDDEV_SAMP(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS stdev, AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS mean FROM inventory JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN warehouse ON inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN date_dim ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE d_year = 1998 AND d_moy IN (1, 2) GROUP BY w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy) foo WHERE mean != 0 AND stdev/mean > 1"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "inv output columns unchanged",
        "main_query unmodified"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.44x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Push d_moy IN (1, 2) from outer query into the CTE's WHERE clause. This filters inventory rows BEFORE aggregation.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-001** - OR to UNION ALL Decomposition
  Trigger: OR conditions spanning different columns (col_a = X OR col_b = Y)
  Rewrite: Split into separate SELECTs with UNION ALL, add exclusion predicates to avoid duplicates
   Matched: OR condition in WHERE clause

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)

Now output your rewrite_sets:
