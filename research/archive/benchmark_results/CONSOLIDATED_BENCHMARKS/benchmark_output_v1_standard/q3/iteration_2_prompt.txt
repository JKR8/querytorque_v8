## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 1.5-2.5x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

## Example: Flatten Subquery to JOIN (FLATTEN_SUBQUERY)
Verified speedup: 1.3-2.0x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
FROM customer
WHERE c_customer_sk IN (
  SELECT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000)
)

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "flatten_subquery",
      "nodes": {
        "target_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "active_customers": "SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales JOIN target_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT c.c_customer_id, c.c_first_name, c.c_last_name FROM customer c JOIN active_customers ac ON c.c_customer_sk = ac.ss_customer_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** IN subquery becomes a JOIN. Nested IN becomes chained CTEs. DISTINCT ensures no duplicates from the semi-join semantics.

## Example: Inline Single-Use CTE (INLINE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.1-1.3x

### Input:
[cte_a]:
SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000

[cte_b]:
SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Music'

[main_query]:
SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price)
FROM store_sales
JOIN cte_a ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN cte_b ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "inline_cte",
      "nodes": {
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price) FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk WHERE d_year = 2000 AND i_category = 'Music'"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.2x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Single-use CTEs can prevent optimizer from pushing predicates. Inlining allows better join ordering and predicate pushdown.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json

## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:

## Execution Plan
```
Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 82.4% cost, 227,358,518 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 17.3% cost, 65,332 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 0.2% cost, 133 rows
- TOP_N: 0.0% cost, 100 rows
- PROJECTION: 0.0% cost, 133 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x1: 3,455,964,288 rows (no filter)
- item x1: 408,000 → 51 rows (filtered)
- date_dim x1: 73,049 → 6,000 rows (filtered)

Misestimates:
- PROJECTION: est 19,723 vs actual 133 (148.3x)
- PROJECTION: est 19,723 vs actual 133 (148.3x)
- HASH_GROUP_BY: est 19,723 vs actual 133 (148.3x)
- FILTER: est 5,620 vs actual 150 (37.5x)

Joins:
- HASH_JOIN: ? x ? -> 12,516 rows
- HASH_JOIN: store_sales x item -> 65,332 rows (late)
