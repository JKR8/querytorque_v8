  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE (reducing from 73K rows to ~31 rows), isolated item filter into CTE (reducing from 408K rows to 204K rows), then performed filtered joins. This reduces the web_sales scan from joining with full tables to joining with pre-filtered dimension tables. The window function calculation is deferred until after aggregation to minimize computation."
