  "explanation": "Applied reorder_join to eliminate the filtered_sales CTE and push the web_sales join directly into aggregated_sales. This allows the optimizer to apply join reordering between date_dim, item, and web_sales, potentially using more efficient join strategies (e.g., reordering to start with the most selective filters first). The elimination of the intermediate filtered_sales CTE reduces materialization overhead and enables better predicate pushdown and join ordering decisions by the optimizer."
