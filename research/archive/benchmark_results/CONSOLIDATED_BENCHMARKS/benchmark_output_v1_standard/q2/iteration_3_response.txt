  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filtering into a CTE that pre-filters only relevant years (1998,1999). Modified wswscs to include d_year in GROUP BY, enabling direct year-based partitioning without scanning date_dim multiple times. This reduces 3 date_dim scans to 1, pushes year filtering before aggregation, and eliminates redundant joins."
