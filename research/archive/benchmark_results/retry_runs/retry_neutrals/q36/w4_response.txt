  "explanation": "Applied two sequential optimizations: 1) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE to push year filter early and isolate store filter, reducing the fact table rows scanned. 2) SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION using GROUPING SETS to compute all three aggregation levels (by i_category/i_class, by i_category only, and overall) in a single scan of the filtered data instead of three separate scans via UNION. The second rewrite builds upon the first's filtered CTEs for maximum efficiency."
