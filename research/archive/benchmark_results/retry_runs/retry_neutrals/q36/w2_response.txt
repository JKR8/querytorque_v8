  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce store_sales scan from 345M to ~5M rows early. Isolated store filter into CTE to reduce store_sales join cardinality. Created filtered_sales CTE that applies both date and store filters before joining with item. This reduces the largest hash join cost from 89.2% by filtering fact table early."
