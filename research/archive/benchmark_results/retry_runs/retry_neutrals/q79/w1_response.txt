  "explanation": "Applied two independent optimizations: 1) OR_TO_UNION splits the OR condition on household_demographics into separate branches with UNION ALL, avoiding repeated scanning of large fact tables. 2) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE creates early filtered CTEs for date_dim and store, reducing join sizes before the expensive store_sales scan. The OR_TO_UNION approach is more aggressive and expected to yield higher speedup by enabling better predicate pushdown and index usage for each branch."
