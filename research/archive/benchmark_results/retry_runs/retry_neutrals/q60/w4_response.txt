  "explanation": "Created filtered CTEs for date_dim, customer_address, and item to avoid repeated filtering of these dimension tables across all three sales channels. The date_dim filter (d_year=1998, d_moy=9) reduces from 73,049 to 30 rows, customer_address filter reduces from 750,000 to 90,666 rows, and item filter reduces to only Music category items. This eliminates redundant scans and joins while preserving exact semantics."
