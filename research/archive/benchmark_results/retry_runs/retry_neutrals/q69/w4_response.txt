  "explanation": "rs_01 isolates date_dim filter into a reusable CTE and pre-filters fact tables by date, reducing 3 separate date_dim scans to 1. The EXISTS/NOT EXISTS patterns are preserved. rs_02 further transforms EXISTS/NOT EXISTS to IN/NOT IN with single-pass fact table scans, which can be more efficient when date_filter is small and customer keys are indexed. Both rewrites maintain exact semantic equivalence while reducing redundant date_dim access and enabling better join optimization."
