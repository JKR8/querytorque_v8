  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter into a shared CTE (filtered_dates) that is joined early with store_sales and store_returns. This reduces multiple scans of date_dim (from 6 to 1) and pushes the date filter before the expensive fact table joins. The rewrite maintains exact semantics while allowing the optimizer to use a smaller filtered date set for both sales and returns aggregations."
