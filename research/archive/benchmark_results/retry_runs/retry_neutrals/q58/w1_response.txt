  "explanation": "Isolated the repeated date subquery pattern into a single CTE (week_dates) that returns date_sk values for the target week. This CTE replaces 9 separate date_dim scans (3 per sales CTE) with just 2 scans (one for the constant date, one for the week). Each sales CTE now joins directly with week_dates using the date surrogate key, eliminating redundant joins with date_dim and correlated subquery evaluations. This reduces I/O and computation significantly while preserving exact semantics."
