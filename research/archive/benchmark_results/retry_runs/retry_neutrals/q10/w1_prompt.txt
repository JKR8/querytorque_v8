## Example: Decorrelate Subquery (DECORRELATE)
Verified speedup: 2.92x

### Input:
[customer_total_return] CORRELATED:
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 FROM customer_total_return ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk AND s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Push s_state='SD' filter EARLY into first CTE. Compute average as SEPARATE CTE with GROUP BY (NOT window function). Join on average instead of correlated subquery.

  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
  CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 4505785
  THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40)

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:

      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {

      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-001** - OR to UNION ALL Decomposition
  Trigger: OR conditions spanning different columns (col_a = X OR col_b = Y)
  Rewrite: Split into separate SELECTs with UNION ALL, add exclusion predicates to avoid duplicates
   Matched: OR condition in WHERE clause

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)
