  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: (1) Isolated date_dim filters into CTEs to filter fact tables early, reducing the cardinality of subsequent joins. (2) Converted the OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales into a UNION ALL in a CTE, allowing separate processing of each sales channel followed by a single semi-join. These changes reduce repeated full table scans and enable better join ordering."
