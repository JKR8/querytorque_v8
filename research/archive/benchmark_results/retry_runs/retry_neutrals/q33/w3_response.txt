Looking at this query pattern, I see three CTEs (ss, ws, cs) that share identical structure with repeated filters and subqueries. The main opportunity is to materialize the repeated subquery and pre-filter dimension tables.

  "explanation": "Created three helper CTEs: (1) filtered_dates to isolate date_dim filtering, (2) filtered_addresses to isolate customer_address filtering, and (3) electronics_items to materialize the repeated subquery pattern. This reduces 6 item table scans to 1, 3 date_dim scans to 1, and 3 customer_address scans to 1. The main CTEs (ss, ws, cs) now join with these pre-filtered CTEs instead of raw tables with inline subqueries."
