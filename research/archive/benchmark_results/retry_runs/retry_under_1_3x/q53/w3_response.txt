Looking at the target query, I can see it's very similar to the first example (PREFETCH_FACT_JOIN pattern). The query has:
1. A multi-table join with fact table (store_sales) and dimensions (item, date_dim, store)
2. Selective filtering on date_dim (d_month_seq)
3. Complex OR condition on item table
4. Window function with aggregation

The execution plan shows store_sales scan is 97.1% of the cost with 345M rows scanned unfiltered. The date_dim filter reduces to 366 rows. This is ideal for prefetch_fact_join optimization.

  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Prefetch pattern: First CTE filters date_dim (366 rows), second CTE pre-joins with store_sales to reduce fact table rows before joining with other dimensions. 2) OR-to-UNION: Split the complex OR condition into UNION ALL branches since categories are disjoint. This allows better index usage and eliminates OR predicate evaluation overhead."
