Looking at the pattern, I see three CTEs with identical date subqueries - this is the classic "repeated subquery pattern" opportunity (QT-OPT-007). I'll materialize the date lookup into a CTE to avoid repeated computation.

        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_week_seq IN (SELECT d_week_seq FROM target_weeks)",
        "sr_items": "SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty FROM store_returns JOIN item ON sr_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN filtered_dates ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk GROUP BY i_item_id",

  ],
  "explanation": "Extracted repeated date subquery pattern into materialized CTE. The same date filter (finding weeks containing specific dates) was being computed 3 times in parallel CTEs (sr_items, cr_items, wr_items). Now it's computed once in 'filtered_dates' CTE and reused via join. This eliminates repeated scans of date_dim and redundant subquery execution."
