  "explanation": "Prefiltered date_dim (30 rows) and item (1,836 rows) into CTEs, then joined them early with store_sales to reduce the fact table rows before joining with other dimensions. This follows the PREFETCH_FACT_JOIN pattern shown in the first example. Also prefetched store and customer_address CTEs (though unfiltered) to ensure only needed columns are propagated. The main query then joins these prefiltered sets and applies the zip inequality condition. This reduces the expensive store_sales scan from 880K rows to only rows matching the date and item filters early in the plan."
