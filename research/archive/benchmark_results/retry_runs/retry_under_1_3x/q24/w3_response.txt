  "explanation": "Pushed i_color='peach' filter into ssales CTE before aggregation, reducing rows from ~25.8M to estimated ~2.5M (based on 10% selectivity). Created separate CTE for overall average calculation to avoid recomputing full ssales. This transforms correlated subquery into efficient join with precomputed scalar, reducing sequential scans of store_sales from 4 to 1."
