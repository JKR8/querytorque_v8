  "explanation": "Extracted repeated date_dim, customer_address, and item filters into shared CTEs. This allows each dimension table to be scanned once with their filters applied early, reducing the data volume before joining with the large fact tables. The item subquery was decorrelated and turned into a CTE join, eliminating repeated execution."
