  "explanation": "Isolated dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, store) into separate CTEs with their filters applied early. The store_sales fact table now joins with these pre-filtered dimension CTEs, reducing the cardinality of the join. This prevents repeated full scans of store_sales (which occurred 3 times in the original plan) and reduces dimension table scans from 3 to 1 each. The results CTE now computes the filtered join once and is reused by the three aggregation subqueries, cutting total work significantly."
