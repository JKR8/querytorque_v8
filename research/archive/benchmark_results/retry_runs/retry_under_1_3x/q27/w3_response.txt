  "explanation": "Created filtered CTEs for all dimension tables (date_dim, store, customer_demographics) before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the working set early and prevents repeated full scans of dimension tables. The 'results' CTE now joins pre-filtered dimension sets, which should dramatically reduce the hash join sizes and eliminate redundant predicate evaluations."
