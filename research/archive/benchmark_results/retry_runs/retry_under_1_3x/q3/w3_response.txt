  "explanation": "Created a CTE to isolate the date_dim filter (d_moy = 11) first, reducing it from 73,049 rows to ~6,000 rows. This smaller CTE is then joined with the fact table (store_sales) early, reducing the join cardinality before joining with item. The item filter (i_manufact_id = 128) is pushed down directly in the main query. This follows the pattern of prefetching dimension filters into CTEs to reduce fact table joins early."
