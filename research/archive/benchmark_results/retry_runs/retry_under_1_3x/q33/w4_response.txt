Looking at this query pattern, I can see three similar CTEs (ss, ws, cs) that perform identical operations on different fact tables, followed by a main query that unions and aggregates them. This is an excellent candidate for optimization through CTE materialization and filter pushdown.

  "explanation": "Two complementary optimizations: 1) Materialize filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item) as CTEs to avoid repeated scanning and filtering. The original query scans date_dim 3 times and customer_address 3 times - this reduces to 1 scan each. 2) Push down the aggregation to avoid double aggregation (CTEs aggregate, then main query aggregates again). Instead, create a single union of base sales data with all filters applied, then aggregate once. This eliminates the intermediate aggregation step and reduces memory usage."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. **Repeated dimension table scans**: Each CTE (ss, ws, cs) independently scans and filters the same dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item). By materializing these filtered sets as CTEs, we scan each dimension table once instead of 3 times.
2. **Double aggregation**: The current structure aggregates in each CTE, then aggregates again in the main query. We can push the aggregation down to occur once on the combined data.
3. **The item subquery pattern** `i_manufact_id IN (SELECT i_manufact_id FROM item WHERE i_category IN ('Electronics'))` can be transformed to a simple join with a filtered item CTE, eliminating the correlated subquery.

The combined approach should yield a 3x+ speedup by reducing dimension table scans from 9 to 3 and eliminating the double aggregation overhead.
