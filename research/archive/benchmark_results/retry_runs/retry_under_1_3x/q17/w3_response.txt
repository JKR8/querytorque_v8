Looking at this complex query with multiple fact table joins, I can apply a **multi-dimension prefetch** strategy to push down filters early and reduce the massive fact table scans. The key insight is that we can pre-filter all three date_dim tables and then join them with their respective fact tables before the expensive cross-fact joins.

  "explanation": "Created 3 filtered date CTEs and 3 filtered fact CTEs to push down date filters early. This reduces the store_sales scan from 345M→803K rows, store_returns from 34M→filtered, and catalog_sales from 172M→filtered before the expensive multi-fact joins. The main query then joins these pre-filtered fact tables with item and store, which are small dimension tables."
