  "explanation": "Applied two transformations: 1) Isolated date_dim filter into a CTE to push down date constraints early. 2) Split OR condition into separate UNION ALL branches to enable focused predicate evaluation and better join planning. The zip_branch handles the ca_zip IN condition, while item_branch handles the IN subquery. The main query uses UNION ALL with duplicate elimination to preserve exact semantics (OR isn't necessarily exclusive)."
