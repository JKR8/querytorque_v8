  "explanation": "Created two CTEs: 1) filtered_dates isolates date_dim scan for the date range, reused in both main query and subquery computation. 2) item_avg_discount pre-computes the 1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) per item for the date range, eliminating correlated subquery execution. The main query now performs efficient joins instead of nested correlated evaluation. This reduces multiple sequential scans of catalog_sales and date_dim to single scans each."
