  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing average discount per item in the date range via CTE. Pushed date and item filters early to reduce join sizes. This eliminates the correlated execution that scans web_sales multiple times (once per qualifying row) and replaces it with single-pass aggregations plus joins."
