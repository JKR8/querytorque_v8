Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see a major opportunity to apply the **Date CTE Isolation** pattern. The query currently performs a full scan of the `web_sales` table (86M rows) before filtering by date. By isolating the date filter early, we can dramatically reduce the rows processed.

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1200 + 11",
        "filtered_sales": "SELECT ws_net_paid, i_category, i_class FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum, i_category, i_class, GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class), CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END ORDER BY SUM(ws_net_paid) DESC) AS rank_within_parent FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_category, i_class) ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC NULLS FIRST, CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END NULLS FIRST, rank_within_parent NULLS FIRST LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same output columns",
        "same result rows",
        "same aggregation semantics",
        "same ordering"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "3.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The original query scans all 86M rows from web_sales before filtering by date. By creating a CTE that first selects only the date keys for the relevant months (reducing from 73K to 366 rows), we can join this filtered set to web_sales early, dramatically reducing the number of web_sales rows that need to be processed. This transforms the query from scanning web_sales->filtering by date to filtering dates->scaling down web_sales, which is much more efficient given the high selectivity of the date filter."
