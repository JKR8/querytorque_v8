Looking at this query, I can identify several optimization opportunities. The main issues are:
1. OR conditions that can be decomposed into UNION ALL
2. Multiple dimension tables that can be pre-filtered
3. Complex CASE expression in WHERE clause that prevents early filtering

Here's my rewrite:

      "invariants_kept": [

      "expected_speedup": "2.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Transformed OR conditions on d_dom and hd_buy_potential into UNION ALL of two branches. Each branch has its own pre-filtered date_dim CTE (for d_dom ranges) and household_demographics CTE (for specific hd_buy_potential values). Also isolated store filter into its own CTE. This allows each branch to use more selective indexes/partition elimination and reduces the working set size for each independent scan."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. The OR condition on `d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 3 OR d_dom BETWEEN 25 AND 28` is split into two branches
2. The OR condition on `hd_buy_potential = '>10000' OR hd_buy_potential = 'Unknown'` is also split, with each branch getting its own household_demographics CTE
3. Each branch gets its own date_dim CTE filtered to the specific d_dom range
4. All dimension tables (store, household_demographics, date_dim) are pre-filtered in CTEs before joining with the large fact table (store_sales)
5. The complex CASE expression in the WHERE clause is simplified by moving the calculation into the household_demographics CTEs

This rewrite reduces the number of rows flowing into the expensive store_sales joins and allows better use of indexes on the dimension tables. The UNION ALL ensures no duplicates between branches since the d_dom ranges are disjoint.
