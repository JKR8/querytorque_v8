  "explanation": "Applied two independent optimizations: 1) OR_TO_UNION to split the OR conditions on d_dom and hd_buy_potential into 4 separate UNION ALL branches, each with specific filters that can leverage indexes better. Each branch scans only relevant date ranges and household demographics. 2) EARLY_FILTER to push dimension table filters (store.s_county, date_dim.d_year/d_dom, household_demographics conditions) into CTEs before joining with the large store_sales fact table, dramatically reducing the join size."
