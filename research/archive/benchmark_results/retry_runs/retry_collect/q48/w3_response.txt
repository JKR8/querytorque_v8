Looking at this query, I see a complex OR condition with two independent OR groups connected by AND. The key optimization opportunities are:

1. **OR to UNION ALL**: There are two independent sets of OR conditions that can be split into separate branches
2. **Date CTE isolation**: The date_dim filter can be extracted into a CTE

However, there's an important nuance: the OR conditions are in two separate groups that are ANDed together. This means we have a logical structure of:
`(A OR B OR C) AND (D OR E OR F)`

This creates 3 × 3 = 9 possible combinations, but we can optimize by:
1. Creating a filtered date CTE
2. Splitting the first OR group into 3 branches
3. Each branch then splits the second OR group into 3 sub-branches

  "explanation": "Split the OR conditions into three UNION ALL branches based on the customer_demographics conditions (M/4yr, D/2yr, S/College). Each branch contains the complete address conditions as ORs since they're independent. Date filter extracted to CTE for reuse. This allows better predicate pushdown and reduces the complex OR evaluation."
}
```

**Alternative approach**: For even better optimization, we could further split each branch into 9 total branches (3×3), but that would be more complex. The current approach balances optimization benefit with maintainability while still providing significant speedup by reducing the OR evaluation complexity and enabling better predicate selectivity.
