  "explanation": "Split the OR condition on customer_demographics into separate UNION ALL branches, each with focused predicates. This allows the optimizer to use more selective indexes and reduce row scans early. Also isolated date, address, and household filters into separate CTEs to push them down into each branch, reducing repeated computation. The date filter was extracted as a CTE (Date CTE Isolation) since it's a constant filter used across all joins. The OR branches are mutually exclusive due to different marital status values, ensuring UNION ALL correctness."
