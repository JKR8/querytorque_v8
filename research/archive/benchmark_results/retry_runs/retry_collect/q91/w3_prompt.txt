## Example: OR to UNION ALL (OR_TO_UNION)
Verified speedup: 3.17x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100

```

**Key insight:** Each OR branch becomes a separate query with focused predicates. Date filter is extracted as CTE and joined into each branch.

**Key insight:** INTERSECT forces materialization and sorting of all three subqueries before computing set intersection. Converting to EXISTS allows the optimizer to use semi-join strategies and stop early when a match is found. Each EXISTS can use indexes on the join columns.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Target Nodes
  [main_query] GROUP_BY

## Subgraph Slice
[main_query] type=main
```sql
SELECT cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center, cc_name AS Call_Center_Name, cc_manager AS Manager, SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss FROM call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics WHERE cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk AND d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 11 AND ((cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown') OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')) AND hd_buy_potential LIKE 'Unknown%' AND ca_gmt_offset = -7 GROUP BY cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status ORDER BY SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC
```


## Node Contracts
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['Call_Center', 'Call_Center_Name', 'Manager', 'Returns_Loss']
  grain: ['cc_call_center_id', 'cc_name', 'cc_manager', 'cd_marital_status', 'cd_education_status']
  required_predicates: ['ca_gmt_offset = -7', 'd_moy = 11', 'd_year = 1998']

## Downstream Usage
No usage data.

## Cost Attribution
[main_query]: 98.7% cost, ~1919005 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[household_demographics], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address]]

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)

Now output your rewrite_sets:

## Execution Plan
```
Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(customer_demographics): 48.6% cost, 1,919,005 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(customer_demographics): 19.5% cost, 276,944 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(customer_demographics): 11.6% cost, 9,584 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 5.5% cost, 1,030 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 4.6% cost, 9,391 rows

Scans:
- customer_demographics x1: 23,049,600 → 1,919,005 rows (filtered)
- catalog_returns x1: 4,321,746 rows (no filter)
- customer x1: 831,000 rows (no filter)
- customer_address x1: 276,000 → 15,118 rows (filtered)
- date_dim x1: 73,049 → 30 rows (filtered)
- household_demographics x1: 7,200 → 1,180 rows (filtered)
- call_center x1: 14 rows (no filter)

Misestimates:
- FILTER: est 1,920,800 vs actual 109,660 (17.5x)
- SEQ_SCAN: est 720,291 vs actual 9,584 (75.2x)

Joins:
- HASH_JOIN: ? x call_center -> 5 rows
- HASH_JOIN: household_demographics x ? -> 5 rows
- HASH_JOIN: ? x ? -> 62 rows
- HASH_JOIN: customer_address x ? -> 1,030 rows
- HASH_JOIN: customer x ? -> 9,391 rows
