  "explanation": "Applied two optimization strategies: 1) OR-to-UNION: Split the OR condition on promotion columns into separate CTEs and use UNION ALL to avoid evaluating the OR condition row-by-row. 2) Date CTE isolation: Extract date_dim filter into CTE to reduce join size early. Both reduce the large catalog_sales scan cost by applying filters earlier and avoiding expensive OR evaluations."
