  "explanation": "Isolated date filtering into a CTE (filtered_dates) that reduces 73,049 date_dim rows to 31 early. Created filtered_items CTE to push i_category filter early (54,000 → subset). Joined web_sales with filtered_dates first, reducing the 43M web_sales rows to only those in date range before joining with items. This allows the expensive web_sales scan to be filtered by date early rather than after joining with all items."
