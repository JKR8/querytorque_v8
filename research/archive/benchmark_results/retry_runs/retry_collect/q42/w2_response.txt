Looking at this query, I can see a classic pattern where the date_dim table is being joined with filters (d_year=2000, d_moy=11). Currently, the query is doing a full sequential scan of store_sales (172M rows) and joining with date_dim later. By isolating the date filter into a CTE and joining it early with store_sales, we can significantly reduce the number of rows from store_sales that need to be processed.

  "explanation": "Created CTEs for filtered dates and items to push filters early. The filtered_dates CTE reduces date_dim from 73K to 30 rows, filtered_items reduces item from 54K to 978 rows. By joining store_sales with filtered_dates first, we reduce the 172M store_sales rows early in the pipeline. The CROSS JOIN with filtered_dates in the main query ensures we get the d_year column without needing to join through date_dim again."
