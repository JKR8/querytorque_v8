  "explanation": "The original query had correlated EXISTS subqueries with OR condition, causing repeated scans of large fact tables. Created date_dim CTE to filter once. Materialized distinct customer sets from each sales channel. Used INTERSECT and UNION to implement logic: customers must have store_sales AND (web_sales OR catalog_sales). This reduces multiple correlated scans to single-pass scans with set operations."
