  "explanation": "Applied two transforms: 1) Date CTE Isolation to filter date_dim early and reduce web_sales rows before joins. 2) OR to UNION ALL decomposition to split the OR condition into two efficient branches - one using zip filter, one using item filter - avoiding repeated full scans and predicate evaluation."
