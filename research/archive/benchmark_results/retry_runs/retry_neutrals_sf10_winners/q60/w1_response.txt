  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered date_dim and customer_address tables to reduce redundant scans. Isolated the repeated 'item' subquery into a materialized CTE. This eliminates 6 scans of item table (2 per original CTE) and reduces date_dim and customer_address scans from 3 each to 1 each. The date_dim CTE isolates the date filter to a small 30-row result, allowing fact tables to join directly to it without scanning full date_dim table repeatedly."
