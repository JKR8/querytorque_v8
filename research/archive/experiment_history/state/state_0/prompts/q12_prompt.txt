## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

Verified speedup: 3.77x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT i_manager_id, sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales,
    avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
  FROM item, store_sales, date_dim, store
  WHERE ss_item_sk = i_item_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND d_month_seq IN (1200,1201,1202,1203,1204,1205,1206,1207,1208,1209,1210,1211)

**Key insight:** First CTE filters the dimension (date_dim). Second CTE pre-joins this with the fact table (store_sales). This creates a smaller intermediate result before joining with other dimension tables. The pre-join materializes the filtered fact rows, making subsequent joins faster.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {

      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite
