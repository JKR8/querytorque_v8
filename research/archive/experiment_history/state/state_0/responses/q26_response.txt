  "explanation": "Consolidated three separate fact table scans into a single pre-joined CTE that performs the dimension joins once, then splits the results into the three promotion condition branches. This eliminates repeated scans of catalog_sales (48.7% cost) and repeated hash joins with dimensions, while preserving the original UNION ALL logic. The rewrite reduces total catalog_sales scans from 3 to 1 while maintaining the exact same output."
