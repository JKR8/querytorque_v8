Looking at this query structure, I can see an opportunity to apply the **date_cte_isolate** pattern more effectively by pushing date filtering earlier in the join sequence. The current plan shows `store_sales` being scanned without any date filtering, resulting in 345M rows scanned.

**Key insight:** The query currently joins `store_sales → date_dim → target_month`. We should create a CTE that pre-filters `date_dim` and then pre-joins it with `store_sales` to reduce the fact table scan early.

  "explanation": "Created filtered_sales CTE that pre-joins store_sales with filtered dates before joining with dimension tables. This reduces the store_sales scan from 345M rows to only sales from the target month (expected ~31 rows from date_dim filter). The category_avg CTE remains unchanged as it's already efficient."
