  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for three filtered dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) to isolate their predicates early and reduce the cardinality before joining with the large store_sales fact table. This follows the successful pattern from the MULTI_DIMENSION_PREFETCH example (2.71x verified speedup). The OR condition on household_demographics is preserved intact (not split) to avoid over-splitting per OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint. All literals are preserved exactly as in the original query."
