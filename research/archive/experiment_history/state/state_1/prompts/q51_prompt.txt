# OPTIMIZATION PROMPT: DISCOVER NEW PATTERNS (Forbidden Known Patterns)

## Your Task
Optimize the following TPC-DS query for maximum execution speed on DuckDB.
**CRITICAL**: You MUST NOT use any of the patterns listed below. Your goal is to discover and apply completely NEW optimization techniques that we haven't seen yet.

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Do Not Use)
You are explicitly forbidden from applying these patterns. We have already discovered and codified them:

1. **date_cte_isolate** - Pre-filtering date_dim into a CTE before joining
   - Example: WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE ...) SELECT ... FROM fact JOIN filtered_dates ...
   
2. **dimension_cte_isolate** - Pre-filtering dimension tables into CTEs
   - Example: WITH filtered_items AS (SELECT i_item_sk FROM item WHERE ...) SELECT ... FROM fact JOIN filtered_items ...

3. **multi_dimension_prefetch** - Pre-filtering multiple dimensions before join
   - Example: WITH d1 AS (...), d2 AS (...) SELECT ... JOIN d1 ... JOIN d2 ...

4. **early_filter** - Pushing filter predicates into CTEs early
   - Example: WITH filtered AS (SELECT ... WHERE condition) SELECT ... FROM filtered WHERE more_conditions ...

5. **decorrelate** - Converting correlated subqueries to JOINs
   - Example: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2 WHERE t2.id = t1.id) FROM t1 → JOIN instead

6. **pushdown** - Pushing filters down to base tables
   - Example: WHERE applied at table level instead of after joins

7. **or_to_union** - Converting OR conditions to UNION ALL
   - Example: WHERE a=1 OR a=2 → UNION ALL of a=1 UNION ALL a=2

8. **materialize_cte** - Forcing CTE materialization
   - Example: WITH MATERIALIZED cte AS (SELECT ...) SELECT ...

9. **intersect_to_exists** - Converting INTERSECT to EXISTS
   - Example: WHERE x IN (SELECT ...) → WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ...)

10. **union_cte_split** - Splitting UNION queries into separate CTEs
    - Example: (SELECT ... FROM t1) UNION (SELECT ... FROM t2) → CTE t1_result, CTE t2_result, then UNION

11. **single_pass_aggregation** - Consolidating repeated scans into CASE aggregates
    - Example: Multiple COUNT(CASE WHEN ...) instead of separate subqueries

12. **time_bucket_aggregation** - Using time-based bucketing for aggregation
    - Example: CASE WHEN hour = 8 THEN ... WHEN hour = 9 THEN ... in single scan

13. **multi_cte_chain** - Progressive filtering through 3+ CTEs
    - Example: filtered_dates → filtered_dates_items → filtered_with_warehouse (each narrows data)

14. **triple_dimension_isolate** - Pre-filtering 3 different dimensions separately
    - Example: 3 separate CTEs for date_dim, item, and store

15. **dual_dimension_isolate** - Pre-filtering exactly 2 dimensions
    - Example: WITH d_dates AS (...), d_items AS (...) SELECT ...

16. **channel_split_union** - Separating by sales channel with separate CTEs
    - Example: ss_cte (store_sales), cs_cte (catalog_sales), ws_cte (web_sales) then UNION

17. **prefetch_fact_join** - Pre-joining filtered dates with fact table
    - Example: Pre-compute fact_sales_with_dates before dimension joins

## What We're Looking For Instead

Think creatively about:
- **Aggregation strategies**: Different grouping levels, partial aggregations, materialization points
- **Join ordering**: Non-obvious join sequences that reduce intermediate result sizes
- **Subquery placement**: Moving subqueries to different locations in the query tree
- **Window function optimization**: Using windows differently (ROWS vs RANGE, partition changes)
- **Set operations**: Novel uses of INTERSECT, EXCEPT, CROSS JOIN, or combinations
- **Conditional logic**: Complex CASE statements, boolean folding, predicate optimization
- **Data flow**: Reverse scans, bottom-up aggregation, materialization at different stages
- **Temp table strategies**: Which intermediate results should be materialized vs computed inline
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combinations of techniques that complement each other (not just one pattern)

## Output Format

When you provide the optimized SQL, ALSO provide:

```
[OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS]
NEW PATTERN: [Give a name to what you did, e.g., "reverse_aggregation_prefilter"]
DESCRIPTION: [Explain the optimization technique in 2-3 sentences]
WHY IT WORKS: [Explain the mechanism - why is this faster?]
PATTERN FAMILY: [What category does this belong to?]
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE: [Show the general structure of this approach]
```

Example of what a NEW pattern analysis might look like:
```
[OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS]
NEW PATTERN: aggregate_before_join
DESCRIPTION: Aggregate at the source table level before any joins, reducing intermediate result size dramatically.
WHY IT WORKS: Smaller intermediate tables mean faster joins and lower memory usage in the join hash table.
PATTERN FAMILY: Early Aggregation
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE: 
  WITH sales_by_date AS (
    SELECT ss_sold_date_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as daily_sales
    FROM store_sales
    GROUP BY ss_sold_date_sk
  )
  SELECT ... FROM sales_by_date JOIN date_dim ...
```

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS [CRITICAL]
NEVER convert EXISTS or NOT EXISTS subqueries into materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)). EXISTS uses semi-join short-circuiting: it stops scanning after the first match. A materialized CTE forces a full table scan and GROUP BY of the entire table, which is catastrophically slower. Keep EXISTS as EXISTS.

### MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD [HIGH]
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

### NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE [HIGH]
Every CTE you create MUST have a WHERE clause that actually reduces the number of rows. Do NOT create CTEs like 'filtered_stores AS (SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_id FROM store)' that select all rows from a dimension table. Selecting fewer columns is NOT filtering - the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query.

### NO_UNION_SAME_COLUMN_OR [HIGH]
Only apply or_to_union when the OR conditions span DIFFERENT tables or create fundamentally different access paths. Do NOT split OR conditions into UNION ALL when all branches filter the SAME column (e.g., 't_hour BETWEEN 10 AND 11 OR t_hour BETWEEN 16 AND 17'). Splitting same-column ORs into UNION ALL doubles or triples the fact table scans. The database optimizer already handles same-column OR efficiently with a single scan.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

### REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES [HIGH]
When you create new CTEs that replace existing ones, you MUST remove the original CTEs from the WITH clause. Your rewrite_sets 'nodes' object should include the replacement node with the SAME node_id to overwrite it, or the original must not appear. Never leave dead/unused CTEs in the query - they still get materialized and waste resources.

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table
