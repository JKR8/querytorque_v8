  "explanation": "Isolated each dimension table into separate CTEs pre-filtered to relevant rows only. This reduces the cardinality of dimension tables before joining with the large store_sales fact table. The date_dim is filtered to 1999, customer_demographics to three specific marital/education combinations, and customer_address to US with specific states. All OR conditions remain intact to avoid over-splitting. The store table CTE includes all rows since no filter exists, but isolating it ensures consistent join ordering."
