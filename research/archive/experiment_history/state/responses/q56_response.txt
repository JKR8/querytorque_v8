  "explanation": "Applied multi-dimension prefetch by isolating all three dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item) into separate CTEs with early filtering. This reduces the cardinality of dimension tables before joining with large fact tables. The item subquery is also replaced with a CTE to avoid repeated execution. All joins now use pre-filtered dimension keys, significantly reducing the hash join build size and eliminating redundant filtering."
