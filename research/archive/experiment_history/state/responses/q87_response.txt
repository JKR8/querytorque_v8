  "explanation": "Created filtered date CTE once and reused it across all three subqueries. Each subquery now joins with the pre-filtered date_dim (365 rows instead of 73K) before joining with customer, reducing the fact table scans from full table to only rows matching the date range. This avoids scanning date_dim three times and reduces the join cardinality early."
