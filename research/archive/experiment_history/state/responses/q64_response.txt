Looking at this query structure, I see a key opportunity similar to the MULTI_DATE_RANGE_CTE pattern. The `cross_sales` CTE uses three different date_dim instances (d1, d2, d3) with different logical purposes - this is exactly the pattern where creating separate date CTEs can provide significant speedup.

However, I need to be careful about the constraints. The `cross_sales` CTE has complex filters on `item` table and other conditions that I must preserve exactly.

Here's my approach:
1. Create separate CTEs for each date_dim instance with their specific filters
2. Join these date CTEs early with their respective fact tables
3. Keep all other filters and joins exactly as in the original

**Key insights:**
1. The pattern matches exactly: three date_dim instances (d1, d2, d3) with different roles
2. By creating date CTEs and joining early, we filter fact tables before the complex multi-table join
3. All literal values are preserved exactly as required by LITERAL_PRESERVATION constraint
4. The OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint doesn't apply here since there are no OR conditions to split
5. The expected speedup of 2.35x matches the verified example pattern
