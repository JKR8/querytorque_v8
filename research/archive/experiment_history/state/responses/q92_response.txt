Looking at the query, I see a correlated subquery with an aggregate comparison. This matches **QT-OPT-002** from the patterns - we can convert the correlated subquery to a pre-computed CTE. The query also has date filtering which suggests **QT-OPT-003** (Date CTE Isolation).

Key observation: The subquery calculates `1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt)` for each item within the same date range. Currently it's executed for every row in the outer query. We can precompute this in a CTE.

  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing 1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt) per item within the date range in a CTE, then joining instead of correlated execution. Also isolated date filtering into a CTE to filter fact table early. This transforms O(n²) correlated execution into O(n) with pre-aggregated CTE."
