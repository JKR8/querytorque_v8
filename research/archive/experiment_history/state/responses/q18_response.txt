Looking at this query pattern, I see a classic star schema with catalog_sales as the fact table joined to multiple dimensions. The main issue is that catalog_sales is scanned unfiltered (172M rows) before joining to already-filtered dimension CTEs. This is inefficient because we're processing the entire fact table before applying dimension filters.

The solution is to create a CTE that pre-joins the fact table with the most selective dimension filters first, reducing the intermediate result size before joining with other dimensions.

  "explanation": "Created a prejoined_facts CTE that joins catalog_sales with the most selective dimension CTEs (filtered_dates, filtered_cd1, filtered_customer) first. This reduces the intermediate fact table rows from 172M to a much smaller set before joining with item, customer_demographics (cd2), and filtered_customer_address. This is similar to the PREFETCH_FACT_JOIN pattern which showed 3.77x speedup."
