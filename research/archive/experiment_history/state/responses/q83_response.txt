Looking at this query pattern, I see a key opportunity: **both `sr_items` and `wr_items` CTEs have similar date filtering logic but implemented differently**. `sr_items` uses the `target_week_dates` CTE, while `wr_items` re-implements the same logic inline with subqueries. This causes:

1. **Duplicate computation** of the same date filtering logic
2. **Unnecessary joins** in `wr_items` with `date_dim` instead of reusing the pre-computed `d_date_sk` values
3. **Wasted computation** on `d_date IN (...)` comparisons instead of using `d_date_sk` joins

The rewrite should:
1. Make `wr_items` reuse `target_week_dates` CTE (like `sr_items` does)
2. Remove the redundant subquery logic in `wr_items`
3. Keep all literal values exactly as in the original

  "explanation": "Rewrote wr_items to reuse the existing target_week_dates CTE instead of recomputing the same date filtering logic with subqueries. This eliminates duplicate date_dim scans and complex IN subqueries, replacing them with a simple join on d_date_sk using the pre-filtered date keys. The semantic is identical because both implementations filter to the same set of weeks (2001-06-06, 2001-09-02, 2001-11-11)."
