You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

RULES:
- Maximize execution speed while preserving semantic invariants (output columns, grain, total result rows).
- Group dependent changes into a single rewrite_set.
- Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` not `cte1`).
- If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not in the allowed list, label it "semantic_rewrite".

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Query Structure

### DAG Topology
```
  [web_v1] type=cte tables=[web_sales, date_dim] GROUP_BY WINDOW
  [store_v1] type=cte tables=[store_sales, date_dim] GROUP_BY WINDOW
  [main_query] type=main tables=[web_v1, store_v1] GROUP_BY

## Performance Profile

### Cost Attribution
[main_query]: 61.7% cost, ~1000 rows, ops=[HASH_JOIN]
[web_v1]: 14.6% cost, ~1437873 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], HASH_GROUP_BY]
[store_v1]: 23.3% cost, ~5505948 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]]

### Execution Plan
```
Operators by cost:
- WINDOW: 37.4% cost, 5,541,413 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 23.3% cost, 5,505,948 rows
- WINDOW: 15.2% cost, 4,591,986 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 6.8% cost, 1,437,873 rows
- WINDOW: 6.0% cost, 1,367,938 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x1: 345,611,892 rows (no filter)
- web_sales x1: 86,370,792 rows (no filter)
- date_dim x2: 73,049 → 365 rows (filtered)

Misestimates:
- FILTER: est 14,609 vs actual 365 (40.0x)
- SEQ_SCAN: est 14,609 vs actual 365 (40.0x)
- FILTER: est 14,609 vs actual 365 (40.0x)
- SEQ_SCAN: est 14,609 vs actual 365 (40.0x)

Joins:
- HASH_JOIN: ? x ? -> 5,541,413 rows
- HASH_JOIN: store_sales x ? -> 5,505,948 rows (late)
- HASH_JOIN: web_sales x ? -> 1,437,873 rows (late)
```

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table

PUSHDOWN: [main_query] filters on [web_v1] after GROUP BY
  Fix: Push filter into CTE before aggregation
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q93: 2.71x)

## Previous Attempts

- baseline: 1.00x [none] NEUTRAL
- v2_standard: 1.00x [date_cte_isolate] NEUTRAL
- dsr1: 0.87x [prefetch_fact_join] REGRESSION

**No effect**: date_cte_isolate
**Regression**: prefetch_fact_join

**Recommended patterns** (details in Examples section below):
- **deferred_window_aggregation** (1.36x) — When multiple CTEs each perform GROUP BY + WINDOW (cumulative sum), then are joined with FULL OUTER JOIN followed by another WINDOW pass for NULL carry-forward: defer the WINDOW out of the CTEs, join daily totals, then compute cumulative sums once on the joined result.

### Original SQL:
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ss_sales_price))
      over (partition by ss_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from store_sales
    ,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

### Optimized SQL:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11), filtered_web_sales AS (SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, ws_sales_price FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE NOT ws_item_sk IS NULL), filtered_store_sales AS (SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE NOT ss_item_sk IS NULL), web_v1 AS (SELECT item_sk, d_date, SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales FROM filtered_web_sales GROUP BY item_sk, d_date), store_v1 AS (SELECT item_sk, d_date, SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales FROM filtered_store_sales GROUP BY item_sk, d_date)
SELECT * FROM (SELECT item_sk, d_date, web_sales, store_sales, MAX(web_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative, MAX(store_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN NOT web.item_sk IS NULL THEN web.item_sk ELSE store.item_sk END AS item_sk, CASE WHEN NOT web.d_date IS NULL THEN web.d_date ELSE store.d_date END AS d_date, web.cume_sales AS web_sales, store.cume_sales AS store_sales FROM web_v1 AS web FULL OUTER JOIN store_v1 AS store ON (web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date)) AS x) AS y WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative ORDER BY item_sk, d_date LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** When CTEs compute GROUP BY + WINDOW (running sum), then FULL OUTER JOIN introduces NULLs requiring a MAX() OVER() carry-forward pass: remove WINDOW from the CTEs (keep only GROUP BY for daily totals), join the daily totals, then compute SUM() OVER() once on the joined result. SUM() naturally skips NULLs, so the carry-forward is free. Reduces 3 WINDOW passes (2 in CTEs + 1 MAX carry-forward) to 1.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use when the CTE window function is referenced by other consumers besides the final join (the cumulative value is needed elsewhere). Do not use when the window function is not a monotonically accumulating SUM - e.g., AVG, COUNT, or non-monotonic window functions require separate computation. Only applies when the join is FULL OUTER and the carry-forward window is MAX/LAST_VALUE over a cumulative sum.

## Constraints

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD** [HIGH]: If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE** [HIGH]: Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD** [HIGH]: Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES** [HIGH]: When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS** [CRITICAL]: Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.
