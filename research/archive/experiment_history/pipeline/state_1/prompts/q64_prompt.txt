# OPTIMIZATION PROMPT: DISCOVER NEW PATTERNS (Forbidden Known Patterns)

## Your Task
Optimize the following TPC-DS query for maximum execution speed on DuckDB.
**CRITICAL**: You MUST NOT use any of the patterns listed below. Your goal is to discover and apply completely NEW optimization techniques that we haven't seen yet.

## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Do Not Use)
You are explicitly forbidden from applying these patterns. We have already discovered and codified them:

1. **date_cte_isolate** - Pre-filtering date_dim into a CTE before joining
   - Example: WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE ...) SELECT ... FROM fact JOIN filtered_dates ...
   
2. **dimension_cte_isolate** - Pre-filtering dimension tables into CTEs
   - Example: WITH filtered_items AS (SELECT i_item_sk FROM item WHERE ...) SELECT ... FROM fact JOIN filtered_items ...

3. **multi_dimension_prefetch** - Pre-filtering multiple dimensions before join
   - Example: WITH d1 AS (...), d2 AS (...) SELECT ... JOIN d1 ... JOIN d2 ...

4. **early_filter** - Pushing filter predicates into CTEs early
   - Example: WITH filtered AS (SELECT ... WHERE condition) SELECT ... FROM filtered WHERE more_conditions ...

5. **decorrelate** - Converting correlated subqueries to JOINs
   - Example: SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2 WHERE t2.id = t1.id) FROM t1 → JOIN instead

6. **pushdown** - Pushing filters down to base tables
   - Example: WHERE applied at table level instead of after joins

7. **or_to_union** - Converting OR conditions to UNION ALL
   - Example: WHERE a=1 OR a=2 → UNION ALL of a=1 UNION ALL a=2

8. **materialize_cte** - Forcing CTE materialization
   - Example: WITH MATERIALIZED cte AS (SELECT ...) SELECT ...

9. **intersect_to_exists** - Converting INTERSECT to EXISTS
   - Example: WHERE x IN (SELECT ...) → WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM ...)

10. **union_cte_split** - Splitting UNION queries into separate CTEs
    - Example: (SELECT ... FROM t1) UNION (SELECT ... FROM t2) → CTE t1_result, CTE t2_result, then UNION

11. **single_pass_aggregation** - Consolidating repeated scans into CASE aggregates
    - Example: Multiple COUNT(CASE WHEN ...) instead of separate subqueries

12. **time_bucket_aggregation** - Using time-based bucketing for aggregation
    - Example: CASE WHEN hour = 8 THEN ... WHEN hour = 9 THEN ... in single scan

13. **multi_cte_chain** - Progressive filtering through 3+ CTEs
    - Example: filtered_dates → filtered_dates_items → filtered_with_warehouse (each narrows data)

14. **triple_dimension_isolate** - Pre-filtering 3 different dimensions separately
    - Example: 3 separate CTEs for date_dim, item, and store

15. **dual_dimension_isolate** - Pre-filtering exactly 2 dimensions
    - Example: WITH d_dates AS (...), d_items AS (...) SELECT ...

16. **channel_split_union** - Separating by sales channel with separate CTEs
    - Example: ss_cte (store_sales), cs_cte (catalog_sales), ws_cte (web_sales) then UNION

17. **prefetch_fact_join** - Pre-joining filtered dates with fact table
    - Example: Pre-compute fact_sales_with_dates before dimension joins

## What We're Looking For Instead

Think creatively about:
- **Aggregation strategies**: Different grouping levels, partial aggregations, materialization points
- **Join ordering**: Non-obvious join sequences that reduce intermediate result sizes
- **Subquery placement**: Moving subqueries to different locations in the query tree
- **Window function optimization**: Using windows differently (ROWS vs RANGE, partition changes)
- **Set operations**: Novel uses of INTERSECT, EXCEPT, CROSS JOIN, or combinations
- **Conditional logic**: Complex CASE statements, boolean folding, predicate optimization
- **Data flow**: Reverse scans, bottom-up aggregation, materialization at different stages
- **Temp table strategies**: Which intermediate results should be materialized vs computed inline
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combinations of techniques that complement each other (not just one pattern)

## Output Format

When you provide the optimized SQL, ALSO provide:

```
[OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS]
NEW PATTERN: [Give a name to what you did, e.g., "reverse_aggregation_prefilter"]
DESCRIPTION: [Explain the optimization technique in 2-3 sentences]
WHY IT WORKS: [Explain the mechanism - why is this faster?]
PATTERN FAMILY: [What category does this belong to?]
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE: [Show the general structure of this approach]
```

Example of what a NEW pattern analysis might look like:
```
[OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS]
NEW PATTERN: aggregate_before_join
DESCRIPTION: Aggregate at the source table level before any joins, reducing intermediate result size dramatically.
WHY IT WORKS: Smaller intermediate tables mean faster joins and lower memory usage in the join hash table.
PATTERN FAMILY: Early Aggregation
EXAMPLE STRUCTURE: 
  WITH sales_by_date AS (
    SELECT ss_sold_date_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as daily_sales
    FROM store_sales
    GROUP BY ss_sold_date_sk
  )
  SELECT ... FROM sales_by_date JOIN date_dim ...
```

## Constraints

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD** [HIGH]: If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE** [HIGH]: Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD** [HIGH]: Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES** [HIGH]: When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS** [CRITICAL]: Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.
