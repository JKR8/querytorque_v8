Looking at the query structure and execution plan, I can see that:

1. The main query creates two subqueries `y` and `z` that both filter `wswscs` by `d_year = 1998` and `d_year = 1999` respectively
2. Both subqueries join `wswscs` with `date_dim` again after aggregation
3. The `wswscs` CTE already joins with `date_dim` to get `d_week_seq` and `d_day_name`
4. The `d_year` filter could be pushed down into the `wswscs` CTE to reduce the amount of data processed

However, looking at the "Previous Attempts" section, pushing the filter into `wswscs` caused a regression (0.96x speedup). This suggests we need a different approach.

Looking at the execution plan, I notice:
- The `wswscs` CTE produces ~253,186 rows
- The `y` and `z` subqueries each filter this down to ~42,671 rows using `d_year` filters
- The main query then joins these two filtered sets

The opportunity is to apply the `d_year` filter **before** the aggregation in `wswscs`, which would significantly reduce the amount of data being aggregated. This is an "early_filter" transformation.

This reduces the amount of data being aggregated by filtering on d_year before the expensive GROUP BY operation, and eliminates the need for the additional join with date_dim in the y and z subqueries."
