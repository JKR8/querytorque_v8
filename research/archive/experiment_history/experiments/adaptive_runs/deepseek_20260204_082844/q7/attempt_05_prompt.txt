You are a SQL optimizer. Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Only use transforms from the allowlist
- Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)
- Coordinate multi-node changes in rewrite_sets
- No formatting-only changes
- No column renames unless required

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, in_to_exists, projection_prune, early_filter, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "transform_name",
      "nodes": {
        "node_id": "new SQL..."
      },

## Target Nodes
  [main_query] GROUP_BY

## Subgraph Slice
[main_query] type=main
```sql
/* start query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl */ SELECT i_item_id, AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk AND ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk AND cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'College' AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') AND d_year = 2001 GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```


## Node Contracts
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['i_item_id', 'agg1', 'agg2', 'agg3', 'agg4']
  grain: ['i_item_id']
  required_predicates: ['d_year = 2001', "cd_education_status = 'College'", "cd_marital_status = 'W'"]

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-001** - OR to UNION ALL Decomposition
  Trigger: OR conditions spanning different columns (col_a = X OR col_b = Y)
  Rewrite: Split into separate SELECTs with UNION ALL, add exclusion predicates to avoid duplicates
   Matched: OR condition in WHERE clause

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)
