Looking at the query and execution plan, I can identify two main optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The subquery `(SELECT DISTINCT (d_month_seq) FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3)` is executed once but could be materialized as a CTE to avoid repeated computation and enable better join planning.

2. **Decorrelate the category average subquery**: The correlated subquery `(SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) FROM item AS j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)` is executed for each row, which is inefficient. This can be transformed into a CTE that computes average prices per category once.

Here's the optimized version:

    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "decorrelate",

        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq",
        "filtered_sales": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same column output",
        "same grouping and aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Extracted the date month_seq subquery into a CTE (target_month) to compute it once. Created a CTE (category_avg_price) to compute the 1.2*average price per category, eliminating the correlated subquery. Created filtered_dates CTE to join date_dim with the target month, and filtered_sales CTE to pre-join store_sales with filtered dates. The main query now uses these CTEs with regular joins instead of subqueries, allowing the optimizer to choose better join orders and reducing repeated computations."
