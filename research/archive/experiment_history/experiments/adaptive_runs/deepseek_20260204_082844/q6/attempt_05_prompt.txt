You are a SQL optimizer. Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Only use transforms from the allowlist
- Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)
- Coordinate multi-node changes in rewrite_sets
- No formatting-only changes
- No column renames unless required

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, in_to_exists, projection_prune, early_filter, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "transform_name",
      "nodes": {
        "node_id": "new SQL..."
      },
      "invariants_kept": ["list of preserved semantics"],
      "expected_speedup": "2x",
      "risk": "low"
    }

## Target Nodes
  [main_query] GROUP_BY CORRELATED

## Subgraph Slice
[main_query] type=main
```sql
/* start query 6 in stream 0 using template query6.tpl */ SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address AS a, customer AS c, store_sales AS s, date_dim AS d, item AS i WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT (d_month_seq) FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3) AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) FROM item AS j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category) GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```


## Node Contracts
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['state', 'cnt']
  grain: ['ca_state']
  required_predicates: ['i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT AVG(j.i_current_', 'd.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT (d_month_seq) FRO', 's.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk']

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
DECORRELATE: [main_query] has correlated subquery
  Fix: Move aggregate to CTE, join instead of correlated lookup
  Expected: 2-3x speedup (verified Q1: 2.81x)
