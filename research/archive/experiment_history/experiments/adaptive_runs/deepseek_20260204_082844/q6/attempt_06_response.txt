Looking at the execution plan and previous attempts, I can see that decorrelate has been tried multiple times with modest success (1.17x-1.26x). The key insight from the execution plan is that there's a correlated subquery in `filtered_dates` that's being executed for each row. Additionally, I notice that `category_avg_price` CTE is computing averages for ALL categories, but the main query only needs categories where `i_current_price > 1.2 * avg_price`.

Let me apply a **pushdown** transform to push the price filter into the `category_avg_price` CTE to reduce the number of rows processed.

  "explanation": "Pushed the price filter condition into the category_avg_price CTE's WHERE clause. This filters items before computing averages, reducing the number of rows that need to be aggregated and joined. The filter i_current_price > 1.2 * avg_price is now applied at two levels: first to filter items before aggregation, then again in the main query for final filtering. This should reduce the size of the category_avg_price CTE significantly."
