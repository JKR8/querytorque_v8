You are a SQL optimizer. Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Only use transforms from the allowlist
- Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)
- Coordinate multi-node changes in rewrite_sets
- No formatting-only changes
- No column renames unless required

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, in_to_exists, projection_prune, early_filter, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "transform_name",
      "nodes": {

## Target Nodes
  [customer_total_return] GROUP_BY
  [main_query] GROUP_BY CORRELATED

## Subgraph Slice
[customer_total_return] type=cte
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return FROM store_returns, date_dim WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000 GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```

[main_query] type=main
```sql
/* start query 1 in stream 0 using template query1.tpl */ WITH customer_total_return AS (SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return FROM store_returns, date_dim WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000 GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk) SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk) AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk AND s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```


## Node Contracts
[customer_total_return]:
  output_columns: ['ctr_customer_sk', 'ctr_store_sk', 'ctr_total_return']
  grain: ['sr_customer_sk', 'sr_store_sk']
  required_predicates: ['sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk', 'd_year = 2000']
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['c_customer_id']
  grain: ['sr_customer_sk', 'sr_store_sk']
  required_predicates: ['ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk', "s_state = 'SD'", 'ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT AVG(ctr_total_retu']

## Downstream Usage
[customer_total_return]: downstream_refs=['c_customer_id', 'd_year', 'SR_FEE', 'c_customer_sk', 'ctr_total_return', 's_state', 'sr_store_sk', 'sr_returned_date_sk', 's_store_sk', 'd_date_sk']

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-002** - Correlated Subquery to Pre-computed CTE
  Trigger: WHERE col > (SELECT AVG/SUM/COUNT FROM ... WHERE correlated)
  Rewrite: Create CTE with GROUP BY on correlation key, then JOIN instead of correlated lookup
   Matched: Correlated subquery with aggregate comparison

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
DECORRELATE: [main_query] has correlated subquery
  Fix: Move aggregate to CTE, join instead of correlated lookup
  Expected: 2-3x speedup (verified Q1: 2.81x)

PUSHDOWN: [main_query] filters on [customer_total_return] after GROUP BY
  Fix: Push filter into CTE before aggregation
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q93: 2.71x)
