Looking at this query, I can see a correlated subquery in the main query that compares `ctr_total_return` against an average of returns for the same store. The current execution plan shows this is being evaluated as a correlated subquery for each row. I can use the `decorrelate` transform to pre-compute the store averages and join instead.

**Key insight:** The correlated subquery `WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)` can be rewritten by pre-computing store averages in a CTE, then joining to compare.

  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by creating a CTE (store_avg_return) that pre-computes the average threshold per store. This replaces the correlated subquery with a simple join, eliminating repeated aggregation for each row. The store filter (s_state = 'SD') can be pushed down but is kept as-is to maintain contract."
