  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Decorrelated the subquery by creating a CTE (store_avg_return) that pre-computes the average return per store, eliminating the correlated execution. 2) Pushed down the store state filter into the customer_total_return CTE via an EXISTS subquery to reduce rows before aggregation. Both preserve the original semantics while improving performance."
