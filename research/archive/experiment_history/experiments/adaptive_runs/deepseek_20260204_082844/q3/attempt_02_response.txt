Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see that:

1. The query filters `date_dim` on `d_moy = 11` (month = November)
2. The query filters `item` on `i_manufact_id = 816`
3. The execution plan shows sequential scans on all three tables
4. The date_dim filter reduces 5,620 rows, item filter reduces to 166 rows, but store_sales has ~2.8M rows

The opportunity here is to apply **early filtering** to reduce the fact table (store_sales) join size. Currently, we're joining the full store_sales table with filtered dimension tables. Instead, we should filter the fact table early by joining with filtered dimension CTEs.

  "explanation": "Applied early filtering by creating CTEs for filtered dimension tables (date_dim with d_moy=11 and item with i_manufact_id=816), then joining these with store_sales early to reduce the fact table size before the main aggregation. This reduces the join cardinality significantly as we filter store_sales to only include rows matching the filtered dimensions."
