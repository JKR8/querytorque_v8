Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see that:

1. The query filters `date_dim` on `d_moy = 11` (month = November)
2. The query filters `item` on `i_manufact_id = 816`
3. The execution plan shows sequential scans on all three tables
4. The date_dim filter `d_moy = 11` reduces rows from ~5,620 (out of ~73,049 total in date_dim)
5. The item filter `i_manufact_id = 816` reduces rows to ~166 (out of ~102,000 total in item)

The key opportunity is that the date filter `d_moy = 11` creates a small subset of dates that can be joined early with store_sales to dramatically reduce the number of store_sales rows processed. Currently, the plan does a hash join between store_sales and item first (2.5M rows), then joins with filtered dates.

I'll use the `early_filter` transform to push the date filtering earlier in the join order:

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Created CTEs for filtered dates (d_moy = 11) and filtered items (i_manufact_id = 816) to push these filters earlier. By joining store_sales with filtered_dates first, we reduce the number of store_sales rows from ~2.9M to only those with dates in November (~194 rows in the plan). This dramatically reduces the intermediate result size before joining with items."
