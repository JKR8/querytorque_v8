Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see the main performance issue: the OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS subqueries is causing inefficient execution. The plan shows this as a complex filter with multiple semi-joins and mark joins. The OR condition prevents efficient predicate pushdown and forces evaluation of both subqueries even when one might be sufficient.

The `or_to_union` transform is appropriate here, but previous attempts failed. Looking more carefully at the query structure, I need to handle the OR between two EXISTS subqueries differently. Instead of transforming the entire query with UNION, I should focus on decorrelating the EXISTS subqueries first, then handle the OR condition.

  "explanation": "First, decorrelate the EXISTS subqueries into CTEs that pre-compute customers with sales in each channel during the date range. This allows efficient joins instead of nested subqueries. Second, apply or_to_union to transform the OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales into a UNION ALL with exclusion predicate to avoid duplicates. This eliminates the complex OR evaluation and allows better join optimization."
