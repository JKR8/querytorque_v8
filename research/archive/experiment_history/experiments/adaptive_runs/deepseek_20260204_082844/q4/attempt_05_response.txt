  "explanation": "Pushed down the d_year filter (1999 and 2000) from the main query's WHERE clause into each branch of the year_total CTE. This reduces the amount of data processed during aggregation by filtering date_dim rows early, before joining with fact tables and grouping. The main query's filters t_s_firstyear.dyear = 1999 AND t_s_secyear.dyear = 1999 + 1 etc. are equivalent to requiring d_year IN (1999, 2000) in the CTE. This pushdown preserves all semantics while reducing intermediate result sizes."
