[After 5 attempts] Used a different strategy: created materialized CTEs for dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, customer_address) to push filters earlier, but kept the original join structure and WHERE conditions unchanged. This avoids the semantic changes of the previous attempt by not altering the join order or moving filters out of the main query. The CTEs pre-filter rows, reducing the data joined with store_sales, which should lower hash join costs. DuckDB's optimizer can benefit from explicit materialization for repeated scans, and this approach adheres to constraints by not adding new conditions or restructuring joins.
