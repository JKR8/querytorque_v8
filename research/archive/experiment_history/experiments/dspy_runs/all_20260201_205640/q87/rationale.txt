[After 2 attempts] Used a different approach: combine all sales data using UNION ALL, then aggregate by customer name and date to count appearances in each sales channel. This directly implements the EXCEPT logic (store_sales minus catalog_sales minus web_sales) by checking for presence only in store_sales. This avoids the previous NOT EXISTS approach that failed due to matching issues, and may better handle the set operations by working with aggregated counts. The UNION ALL approach scans each table once and performs aggregation, which could be more efficient than multiple correlated subqueries.
