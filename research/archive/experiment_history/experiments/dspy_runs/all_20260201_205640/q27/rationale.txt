1. **Join Reordering**: Changed the FROM clause order to start with the most selective filtered tables (customer_demographics and date_dim) before joining with the large fact table store_sales. This allows the database to apply filters on cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, and d_year early, reducing the intermediate result set before the expensive store_sales join.

2. **Predicate Pushdown**: All filters remain in the WHERE clause but are now applied earlier in the execution due to the reordered joins. The selective s_state filter on the store table (402 rows) also gets applied earlier.

3. **Performance Impact**: This optimization reduces the number of rows processed in the hash join with store_sales by filtering out irrelevant records earlier. The store_sales sequential scan (83.9% of original cost) will now join with much smaller intermediate results, significantly reducing I/O and CPU usage while maintaining identical query semantics.

4. **No Structural Changes**: The GROUP BY ROLLUP, ORDER BY, and SELECT clauses remain unchanged to preserve the original business logic and output format.
