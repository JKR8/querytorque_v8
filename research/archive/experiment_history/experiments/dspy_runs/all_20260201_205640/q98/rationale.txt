1. **Changed join order**: Starting with `date_dim` (31 filtered rows) reduces the initial row set for joining with `store_sales`, potentially lowering the cost of the hash join and subsequent operations.
2. **Explicit JOIN syntax**: Using `JOIN` instead of comma-separated tables improves readability and can give the optimizer clearer hints for join ordering.
3. **Predicate placement**: The date filter is moved directly into the `WHERE` clause with explicit date syntax, which may aid in predicate pushdown during the join with `date_dim`.
4. **Early filtering**: The `item` category filter is applied in the `WHERE` clause, but since `item` is joined after `store_sales`, the optimizer should still filter early based on the join condition and index availability (if any). The structure encourages filtering `item` rows before or during the join.
These changes aim to reduce the row counts processed in early stages, leveraging the filtered `date_dim` to minimize the `store_sales` scan impact and optimize the overall query performance.
