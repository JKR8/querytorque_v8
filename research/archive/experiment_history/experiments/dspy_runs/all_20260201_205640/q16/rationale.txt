1. **Converted EXISTS to JOINs**: Changed the EXISTS subqueries to explicit JOINs - the first to an INNER JOIN (for warehouse mismatch) and the second to a LEFT JOIN with NULL check (for non-existence). This allows the optimizer to choose optimal join order and use hash/merge joins instead of nested loops.

2. **Used explicit JOIN syntax**: Improved readability and gives the optimizer clearer relationship information.

3. **Removed redundant ORDER BY**: With LIMIT 100 and no specific ordering needed, the ORDER BY on an aggregate function is unnecessary and expensive.

4. **Recommended index creation** (not in query but should be implemented):
   - CREATE INDEX idx_customer_address_state ON customer_address(ca_state)
   - CREATE INDEX idx_date_dim_date ON date_dim(d_date)
   - CREATE INDEX idx_call_center_county ON call_center(cc_county)
   - CREATE INDEX idx_catalog_sales_order_warehouse ON catalog_sales(cs_order_number, cs_warehouse_sk)
   - CREATE INDEX idx_catalog_returns_order ON catalog_returns(cr_order_number)

These changes should significantly reduce execution time by:
- Eliminating correlated subquery overhead
- Enabling better join order optimization
- Reducing unnecessary sorting
- Allowing index usage instead of sequential scans
