1. **Explicit JOIN syntax**: Improves readability and allows the optimizer to better understand join relationships and potentially reorder joins more effectively.

2. **Filter pushdown optimization**: By using explicit JOINs with WHERE conditions, we enable the query optimizer to apply filters earlier in the execution plan. The most selective filters (date_dim.d_year=2001 and customer_demographics conditions) will reduce the intermediate result set before expensive joins with catalog_sales.

3. **Join order hint**: While the optimizer ultimately decides join order, the explicit syntax with selective filters first (date_dim and customer_demographics) encourages processing smaller filtered sets early, reducing the volume of data flowing into subsequent joins.

4. **Reduced sequential scan cost**: The original plan showed 44.0% cost on catalog_sales sequential scan with NO FILTER. By filtering date_dim and customer_demographics first, we can potentially use index-based joins or at least reduce the catalog_sales rows that need to be processed through dynamic filtering.

5. **Maintained semantics**: The optimized query produces identical results while potentially achieving better performance through earlier filtering and reduced intermediate row counts.

This optimization should reduce the overall cost by applying the most restrictive filters earliest in the execution pipeline, minimizing the amount of data that needs to flow through the expensive catalog_sales join operation.
