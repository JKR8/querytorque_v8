[After 2 attempts] This approach uses a different strategy by first filtering `catalog_sales` using the date range via a subquery to reduce the number of rows early (from 14,318 rows to only those within the date range), then joining with `item` and applying the category filter. This reduces the data volume before aggregation and window computation. The CTE `item_sales` aggregates sales per item, including all necessary columns for the final select, ensuring no missing columns like `i_item_sk`. This avoids the syntax error from the previous attempt and aims to lower the cost of the sequential scan on `item` by reducing the join size.
