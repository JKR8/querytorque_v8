1. **Removed redundant filter**: Eliminated `i_current_price between 23 + 1 and 23 + 15` since it's completely covered by `i_current_price between 23 and 23 + 10` (23-33). This reduces predicate evaluation overhead.

2. **Pushed item filters into cs_ui CTE**: By joining with the `item` table early in the cs_ui CTE and applying the color and price filters there, we significantly reduce the number of catalog_sales and catalog_returns rows processed. The row estimates show only 2,112 items pass the filters, so joining early eliminates many unnecessary catalog operations.

3. **Removed duplicate filtering**: Since item filters are now applied in cs_ui, removed the redundant `i_color` and `i_current_price` filters from the main WHERE clause of cross_sales.

4. **Maintained semantic equivalence**: All changes preserve the original query logic. The cs_ui CTE now filters items early, but this doesn't change the final result since the same item filters were applied later in the original query.

These optimizations should reduce the cost of the catalog_sales scan (16.1% in original plan) by filtering early, and may enable better join strategies by reducing intermediate result sizes. The removal of redundant predicate evaluation also provides minor CPU savings.
