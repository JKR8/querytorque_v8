1. **Changed to explicit JOIN syntax**: Improves readability and may help the query optimizer better understand join relationships.
2. **Implicit join reordering**: By using explicit JOINs and placing highly filtered tables (date_dim, item) first in the FROM clause, the optimizer is more likely to filter these tables early, reducing the number of rows joined with the large store_sales table. This should lower the cost of the hash joins and subsequent operations.
3. **Maintained semantic equivalence**: All conditions, groupings, and ordering remain identical to the original query.
4. **Expected performance improvement**: The most expensive operation (sequential scan on store_sales) should now process fewer rows after early filtering of date_dim and item, potentially reducing overall execution time significantly.
