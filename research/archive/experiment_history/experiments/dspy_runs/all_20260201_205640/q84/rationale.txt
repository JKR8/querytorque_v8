1. **Added CTEs for early filtering**: Created `filtered_income_band` and `filtered_customer_address` CTEs to apply the most restrictive filters first, reducing the working set before joins.

2. **Changed to explicit JOIN syntax**: Replaced implicit joins with explicit INNER JOINs for better readability and optimizer control.

3. **Optimized join order**: Starting with the most selective tables (`filtered_customer_address` with 8,281 rows and `filtered_income_band` with 4 rows) to reduce the cardinality early in the execution plan.

4. **Reduced sequential scan overhead**: By filtering `customer_address` and `income_band` first, we avoid scanning millions of rows from `customer` and `customer_demographics` that won't match the address and income criteria.

5. **Maintained identical semantics**: The query returns exactly the same results as the original but with a more efficient execution path.

This optimization should significantly reduce the cost by:
- Eliminating full table scans on large tables
- Reducing the hash join sizes
- Leveraging the most selective filters early in the execution pipeline
