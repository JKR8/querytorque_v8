This optimization improves performance by:
1. **Explicit JOIN syntax**: Makes the query clearer and can help the optimizer understand the join relationships better, though the semantics are identical.
2. **Filter pushdown**: The WHERE conditions (`i_manufact_id = 816` and `d_moy = 11`) are applied early in the execution, reducing the rows from `date_dim` and `item` before joining with `store_sales`. This leverages the filtered scans shown in the table scans (150 rows for `date_dim`, 51 rows for `item`).
3. **Reduced sequential scan cost**: By joining the filtered `date_dim` and `item` first, the database can use indexed lookups on `store_sales` for `ss_sold_date_sk` and `ss_item_sk`, potentially avoiding a full sequential scan of 2.86M rows. This should lower the 94.2% cost associated with the `store_sales` scan.
4. **Maintained efficiency**: The GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations remain unchanged, ensuring the same output while benefiting from fewer intermediate rows.
