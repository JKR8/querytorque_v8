1. **Eliminated INTERSECT**: Replaced the INTERSECT operation with EXISTS subquery, which is more efficient. The original INTERSECT required processing customer_address twice (once for zip code list, once for preferred customer count), while the EXISTS approach checks both conditions in a single pass.

2. **Reduced customer_address scans**: Changed from two scans of customer_address (5,045 rows + 1,000,000 rows) to one scan with combined filtering, reducing I/O and processing overhead.

3. **Maintained semantic equivalence**: The EXISTS subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING preserves the ">10 preferred customers" condition while filtering by the zip code list.

4. **Preserved join conditions**: All original join conditions and filters remain intact, ensuring identical output.

5. **Improved query structure**: The simplified subquery is easier for the query optimizer to understand and potentially use indexes more effectively.

This optimization reduces the most expensive operations (sequential scans) while maintaining the exact same business logic and result set.
