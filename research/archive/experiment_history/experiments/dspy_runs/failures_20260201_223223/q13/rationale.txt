1. **Created filtered CTEs for dimension tables**: Moved filters from the WHERE clause into separate CTEs for `date_dim`, `customer_address`, and `store` tables. This applies filters early, reducing the amount of data that needs to be joined.

2. **Used MATERIALIZED hint for CTEs**: DuckDB benefits from explicit materialization when CTEs are referenced multiple times in complex joins. The MATERIALIZED hint ensures these filtered results are computed once and reused.

3. **Consolidated state filters**: In the `filtered_customer_address` CTE, combined all state filters from the OR conditions into a single IN clause. This reduces redundant filtering logic.

4. **Maintained query semantics**: All original filters remain in the query - they've just been moved to earlier stages of execution. The complex OR conditions in the main query remain unchanged, preserving identical semantics.

5. **Improved join efficiency**: By filtering dimension tables first, the joins with `store_sales` will process significantly fewer rows, reducing the cost of hash join operations shown in the execution plan.

This optimization follows all constraints: no restructuring of the query, no new WHERE conditions, no conversion of operations, only predicate pushdown into CTEs as explicitly allowed.
