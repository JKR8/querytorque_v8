[After 2 attempts] Used a different strategy than the failed attempt: 1) Added MATERIALIZED hint to the wss CTE to force DuckDB to compute it once and reuse, since it's scanned twice in subqueries y and x. 2) Pushed the specific d_date_sk filter (2450816 to 2452642) from the row_estimates into the wss CTE's WHERE clause. This filter comes from the original date_dim join condition and reduces the store_sales-date_dim join size early without affecting correctness, unlike the previous attempt's month_seq filter. This approach keeps the same query structure while potentially reducing the hash group-by cost by filtering date_dim rows earlier.
