  "explanation": "Pushed down the d_moy filters (d_moy=1 and d_moy=2) from the main query into the CTE 'inv' before the GROUP BY aggregation. Added 'AND d_moy IN (1, 2)' to the inner query's WHERE clause. This reduces the input data to the aggregation from all 12 months to just 2 months, significantly reducing computation while maintaining the same final result."
