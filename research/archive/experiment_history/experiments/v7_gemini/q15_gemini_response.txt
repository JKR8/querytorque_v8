Here is the optimized SQL query.

```sql
WITH q1_2001_sales AS (
    SELECT cs.cs_bill_customer_sk, cs.cs_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN date_dim d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_qoy = 1 AND d.d_year = 2001
)
SELECT ca.ca_zip
       ,SUM(s.cs_sales_price)
FROM q1_2001_sales s
JOIN customer c ON s.cs_bill_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
WHERE ( substr(ca.ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                  '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
        or ca.ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
        or s.cs_sales_price > 500)
GROUP BY ca.ca_zip
ORDER BY ca.ca_zip
LIMIT 100;
```

**Explanation:**
I moved the highly selective `date_dim` filter into a CTE (`q1_2001_sales`) to force the database to reduce the 1.4 million `catalog_sales` rows down to a small dataset (only Q1 2001) *before* performing the expensive joins to the `customer` and `customer_address` tables.
