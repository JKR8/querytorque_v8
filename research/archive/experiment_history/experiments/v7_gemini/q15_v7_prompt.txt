Optimize this SQL query for performance.

## Algorithm

1. **FIND BOTTLENECK**: Look at the largest row sources below
2. **REDUCE EARLY**: For each bottleneck, ask "can we filter this earlier?"
   - Push dimension filters INTO CTEs/subqueries before GROUP BY
   - Convert correlated subqueries to window functions or CTEs
   - Join small filtered tables early to reduce rows before aggregation
3. **VERIFY**: Result must return identical data

Principle: The earlier you reduce rows, the faster everything downstream runs.

## Example

WRONG - filters 1M rows AFTER aggregating all 100M:
```sql
WITH sales_agg AS (
    SELECT store_id, SUM(amount) as total
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY store_id  -- aggregates ALL 100M rows
)
SELECT * FROM sales_agg
WHERE store_id IN (SELECT store_id FROM stores WHERE region = 'West')  -- filters AFTER
```

RIGHT - filters to 1M rows BEFORE aggregating:
```sql
WITH sales_agg AS (
    SELECT s.store_id, SUM(amount) as total
    FROM sales
    JOIN stores s ON sales.store_id = s.store_id
    WHERE s.region = 'West'  -- filter BEFORE GROUP BY
    GROUP BY s.store_id  -- aggregates only 1M West rows
)
SELECT * FROM sales_agg
```

The RIGHT version is 100x faster because it aggregates 100x fewer rows.

## Bottlenecks

- HASH_JOIN: 26.6% cost, 1,432,318 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (catalog_sales): 19.6% cost, 1,439,513 rows <-- BOTTLENECK
- SEQ_SCAN (customer): 14.6% cost, 1,999,998 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer_address): 11.1% cost, 1,000,000 rows

## Table Scans (with selectivity)

- catalog_sales: 1,439,513 rows (NO FILTER) <-- BOTTLENECK
- customer: 2M rows (minimal filter)
- customer_address: 1M rows (dynamic filter on ca_zip)
- date_dim: 73K -> 91 rows (FILTERED by d_qoy=1, d_year=2001) <-- HIGH SELECTIVITY, JOIN EARLY

## SQL

```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                  '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

## Output

Return:
1. The optimized SQL query
2. One sentence explaining what you changed and why
