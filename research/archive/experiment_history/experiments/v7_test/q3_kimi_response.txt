 ```sql
SELECT dt.d_year,
       item.i_brand_id brand_id,
       item.i_brand brand,
       SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) sum_agg
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN (SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand, i_brand_id 
      FROM item 
      WHERE i_manufact_id = 816) item 
  ON ss.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
JOIN (SELECT d_date_sk, d_year 
      FROM date_dim 
      WHERE d_moy = 11) dt 
  ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = dt.d_date_sk
GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

Pushed highly selective filters into subqueries on dimension tables (reducing item to 51 rows and date_dim to 150 rows) before joining to store_sales, eliminating the full 2.8M row sequential scan by only accessing matching rows via the filtered foreign keys.
