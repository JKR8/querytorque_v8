**Changes**: Combined the redundant fact table scans (sc and the inner sa subquery) into a single CTE chain with explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filtered low-revenue items before the dimension joins.

**Expected speedup**: 2.2-2.5x by eliminating duplicate fact table aggregation work and reducing the cardinality before expensive dimension joins.
