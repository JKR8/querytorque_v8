WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply standard filter pushdown and early reduction techniques—pre-filter dimension tables first, then join to facts, and materialize repeating patterns to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate each date_dim alias into separate CTEs with their respective filters, then pre-filter store and item dimensions before joining with the fact CTEs.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in separate CTEs, then combine results; consider consolidating multiple fact scans into single-pass aggregations where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Explore radical restructuring—convert implicit joins to explicit UNION branches, transform intersection logic to EXISTS, and decorrelate subquery patterns.
