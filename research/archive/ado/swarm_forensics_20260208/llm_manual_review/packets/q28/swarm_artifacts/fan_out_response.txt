WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_safe_optimizations
EXAMPLES: pushdown, materialize_cte, early_filter
HINT: Apply filter pushdown to ensure each subquery filters rows early, use CTE materialization to avoid redundant computation, and filter the fact table before aggregation for minimal risk.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte, union_cte_split
HINT: Restructure using CTEs to isolate each quantity range as a separate filtered dataset, enabling better predicate pushdown and potential plan optimization for each range.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_single_pass
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Consolidate all six subqueries into a single table scan with conditional aggregation, prefetch filtered data into CTEs, and share common filter logic across ranges.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches for better index usage, decorrelate multiple disjunctive filters, and apply intersect/exists conversions for structural novelty.
