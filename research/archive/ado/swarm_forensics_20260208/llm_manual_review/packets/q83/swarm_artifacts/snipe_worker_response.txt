**Changes:** Extracted the repeated date-filtering subquery into a shared CTE (`filtered_dates`) and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This eliminates redundant computation of the same date logic three times and gives the optimizer better join ordering freedom.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.8-2.5x due to avoiding repeated date subquery execution and improved join planning.
