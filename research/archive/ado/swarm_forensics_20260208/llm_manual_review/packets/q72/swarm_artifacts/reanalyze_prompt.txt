You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.13x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply predicate pushdown to dimension tables before joining, use CTEs to materialize filtered dimensions, and leverage DuckDB's ability to push filters through joins for minimal intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_household_demo AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
), filtered_customer_demo AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'W'
), filtered_date_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date, d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
)
SELECT
    i_item_desc,
    w_warehouse_name,
    d1.d_week_seq,
    SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NOT p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_cnt
FROM catalog_sales cs
INNER JOIN filtered_date_d1 d1 ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
INNER JOIN filtered_household_demo hd ON cs.cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
INNER JOIN filtered_customer_demo cd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk
INNER JOIN inventory inv ON (
    cs.cs_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk
    AND inv.inv_quantity_on_hand < cs.cs_quantity
)
INNER JOIN date_dim d2 ON (
    inv.inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Values list "base" does not have a column named "cs_ship_date_sk"

LINE 82: JOIN filtered_d3 d3 ON base.cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
                                ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate each date_dim alias (d1,d2,d3) into separate filtered CTEs, pre-filter all dimension tables, then join with fact tables to reduce join cardinality early.

```sql
WITH
-- Isolate d1 with its filter
filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
-- Isolate d2 (no independent filter, but we'll join later with d1 on week_seq)
filtered_d2 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
),
-- Isolate d3 (no independent filter, but we'll apply date comparison later)
filtered_d3 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
),
-- Pre-filter all dimension tables
filtered_cd AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'W'
),
filtered_hd AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
),
-- Join fact tables with pre-filtered dimensions early
cs_with_dates AS (

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.41x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Create layered CTEs—first filter dimensions, then pre-join them with catalog_sales before other joins, and share filtered dimensions across date aliases to avoid repeated filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_household AS (
  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
),
filtered_customer AS (
  SELECT cd_demo_sk
  FROM customer_demographics
  WHERE cd_marital_status = 'W'

    inv.inv_date_sk
  FROM catalog_sales cs
  JOIN filtered_d1 d1 ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (1.09x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore converting implicit OR conditions in CASE statements to UNION ALL branches, transform join patterns to EXISTS subqueries, and decorrelate complex join logic for alternative execution plans.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_hd AS (

Candidate tables: "d2", "d3"

LINE 52: WHERE d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
