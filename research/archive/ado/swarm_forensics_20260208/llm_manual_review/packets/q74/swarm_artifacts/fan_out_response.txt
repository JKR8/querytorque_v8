```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_materialization
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs to reduce data early, pre-filter dimension tables, and materialize the CTE to avoid repeated computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, union_cte_split
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs, then split the UNION ALL CTE by channel to enable targeted optimizations.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_channel_prefetch
EXAMPLES: shared_dimension_multi_channel, multi_date_range_cte, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Pre-filter shared dimensions for multiple sales channels, create separate CTEs for each date range, and prefetch fact joins to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform OR conditions to UNION ALL, convert intersect patterns to EXISTS, and decorrelate subqueries to improve join planning and reduce dependencies.
