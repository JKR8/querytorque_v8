WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables (date_dim, store, item), push predicates into CTEs, and materialize repeated subquery patterns to reduce join sizes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Pre-filter each date_dim alias (d1, d2, d3) and other dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables to leverage predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_stage_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions (date/store/item) with their respective fact tables in staged CTEs, then combine pre-aggregated results to minimize large intermediate joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore converting the d3.d_year IN clause to UNION ALL branches, apply EXISTS-style join transformations, and decorrelate multi-fact joins via distinct customer/item CTEs.
