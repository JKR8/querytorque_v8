FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts failed because they merely rewrote the query using CTEs for dimension filtering without addressing fundamental bottlenecks. DuckDB's optimizer already pushes down filters automatically, making these CTE rewrites syntactic sugar with zero performance benefit (1.00-1.02x). The real bottleneck is the OR condition on household_demographics causing full table scans and the expensive multi-way join before aggregation. Worker 4 mentioned OR-to-UNION but didn't implement it. No attempt addressed data skew, join order optimization, or physical execution hints.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **OR-to-UNION implementation**: Split `hd_dep_count=6 OR hd_vehicle_count=0` into separate branches.
2. **Join order enforcement**: Force dimension tables to be filtered and joined before the large fact table.
3. **Physical hints**: Use `PRAGMA` directives or `SET` statements to control parallelism, memory limits, or join algorithms.
4. **Selectivity-based reordering**: Place most selective filters (store.city, date range) first in join order.
5. **Avoid redundant grouping**: The grouping key includes `ss_addr_sk` which is functionally dependent on `ca_city`; could simplify.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
1. Split OR condition into UNION ALL with deduplication to allow separate filter evaluation.
2. Enforce optimal join order: date → store → household_demographics → customer_address → store_sales.
3. Use DuckDB-specific pragmas to optimize join algorithms and parallel execution.
4. Simplify grouping by removing `ss_addr_sk` (implied by `ca_city` via join).

EXAMPLES: or_to_union, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Implement actual UNION ALL split for household_demographics, enforce join order via subquery nesting, add PRAGMA force_parallelism=8, and verify grouping key correctness.
