**Changes**: Pre-filtered three dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) into CTEs before joining with store_sales and customer_address, reducing the fact table scan early. The aggregation is performed in a single pass after all selective filters are applied.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5–3.5x from reduced intermediate data volume and better join ordering.
