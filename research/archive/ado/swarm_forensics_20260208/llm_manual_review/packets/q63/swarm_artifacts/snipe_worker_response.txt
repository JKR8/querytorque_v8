**Changes**: Applied staged join pipeline: first filtered dates, then joined with store_sales, then filtered items, and finally joined all reduced sets. This reduces early data volume and builds efficient hash tables.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.0-2.5x due to reduced intermediate data size and better join order optimization.
