You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown

LINE 64:         AND ca.ca_state IN ('FL', 'TX', 'DE')
                     ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Filter dimension tables first to reduce row counts, push predicates into CTEs, and isolate date filtering early to minimize fact table joins.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
