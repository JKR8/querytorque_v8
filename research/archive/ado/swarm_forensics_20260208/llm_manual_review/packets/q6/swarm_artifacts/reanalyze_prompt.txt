You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_6
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 6 in stream 0 using template query6.tpl
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 6 in stream 0 using template query6.tpl

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filtering
- **Status**: fail (0.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates down, and materializing the repeated date subquery into a CTE to avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH target_month AS (
    SELECT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
),
category_avg_price AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category,
        AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_price
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category
)
SELECT
    a.ca_state AS state,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address AS a
JOIN customer AS c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN store_sales AS s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
JOIN date_dim AS d ON s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item AS i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN target_month AS tm ON d.d_month_seq = tm.d_month_seq
JOIN category_avg_price AS cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category
WHERE i.i_current_price > 1.2 * cap.avg_price
GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimensions into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, and decorrelate the item price subquery by pre-computing category averages.

```sql
WITH target_month AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
),
filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  JOIN target_month ON date_dim.d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
),
category_avg_price AS (
  SELECT 
    i_category,
    AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS price_threshold
  FROM item
  GROUP BY i_category
),
filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    ss_customer_sk,
    ss_item_sk
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
)
SELECT
  a.ca_state AS state,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a
JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "i_category" (use: "item.i_category" or "cap.i_category")
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure with multi-step CTEs that pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with the fact table, and consolidate the item category average calculation into a single pass.

```sql
WITH target_month AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
),
category_avg_price AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category,
        AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_category_price
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_category,
        i_current_price
    FROM item
    INNER JOIN category_avg_price cap 
        ON item.i_category = cap.i_category
    WHERE i_current_price > 1.2 * cap.avg_category_price
),
filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    INNER JOIN target_month ON date_dim.d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT 
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.22x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore non-conventional transformations such as rewriting subqueries with EXISTS patterns, splitting potential OR conditions on item categories, and applying advanced decorrelation techniques.

```sql
WITH target_month AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
),
category_avg_price AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category,
        AVG(i_current_price) AS avg_price

)
SELECT
    a.ca_state AS state,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM customer_address a

GROUP BY a.ca_state
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH target_month AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3
),
category_avg AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category,
        AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS price_threshold
    FROM item
    GROUP BY i_category

SELECT
    a.ca_state AS state,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
