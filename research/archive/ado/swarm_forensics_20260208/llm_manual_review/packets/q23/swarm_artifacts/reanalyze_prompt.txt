## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: fail (2.63x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations: filter dimension tables early, push predicates into CTEs, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid recomputation.

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: fail (1.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs to enable predicate pushdown across all channel queries (store/catalog/web) and reduce redundant scans.

```sql
WITH date_years AS (
  SELECT
    d_date_sk,
    d_date
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year IN (2000, 2000 + 1, 2000 + 2, 2000 + 3)

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: fail (3.13x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts in CTEs, then consolidate multiple subquery scans into single-pass aggregations to minimize I/O and intermediate results.

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: fail (2.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform subquery patterns (IN → EXISTS/joins), convert OR conditions to UNION ALL branches, and decorrelate dependent subqueries to enable better join planning and parallelism.

WITH frequent_ss_items AS (
  SELECT
    SUBSTRING(i_item_desc, 1, 30) AS itemdesc,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
