WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: filter dimension tables early, push predicates into CTEs, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs to enable predicate pushdown across all channel queries (store/catalog/web) and reduce redundant scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts in CTEs, then consolidate multiple subquery scans into single-pass aggregations to minimize I/O and intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, decorrelate
HINT: Transform subquery patterns (IN → EXISTS/joins), convert OR conditions to UNION ALL branches, and decorrelate dependent subqueries to enable better join planning and parallelism.
