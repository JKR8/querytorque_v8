**Changes**: Decorrelated the IN subqueries by extracting distinct keys into standalone CTEs (`frequent_items_sk`, `best_customers_sk`) and converted them to explicit joins. Also pre-filtered `date_dim` for May 2000 once. This enables better join planning and parallelism while preserving exact semantics.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x from eliminating correlated subquery execution and enabling hash join optimizations.
