FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short because they merely restructured the query with CTEs without changing the fundamental execution plan. DuckDB's optimizer already pushes predicates down and chooses efficient join orders for star schema queries. The CTE-based isolation strategies (attempts 1-5) simply rephrase the original implicit joins into explicit CTE joins, yielding identical or marginally different plans (0.92x–1.07x). The main bottleneck remains the large store_sales table scan and hash join with dimension tables, which none of the attempts reduced materially. Worker 4's structural transformations (or_to_union, etc.) were irrelevant to this simple join pattern.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Fact table reduction before joins**: Use dimension keys to pre-filter store_sales via semi-joins or bloom filters.
2. **Aggregation pushdown**: Perform partial aggregation on store_sales before joining dimensions, then finalize.
3. **Index/partition hints**: Leverage DuckDB's ability to use indexes or partition info via pragmas or hints.
4. **Materialization for repeated use**: Force materialization of filtered dimensions if they're used multiple times (though here they aren't).
5. **Join order forcing**: Use subqueries to force a specific join order (fact-first vs dimension-first).

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Implement a two-phase aggregation that reduces the fact table early: first, join store_sales with the highly selective date_dim to get a reduced fact set with year, then aggregate by item_sk and year, and finally join with filtered items to attach brand info. This minimizes the data flowing through the expensive hash join with the item table.

EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, early_filter
HINT: Pre-join store_sales with filtered date_dim to reduce rows, then aggregate by item_sk before joining with item to cut the join cost dramatically. Use a CTE for the pre-aggregated fact data.
