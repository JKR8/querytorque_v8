```sql

      AND d_year = 2002

    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1

    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,

```

**Changes**: Isolated filtered date_dim and item tables into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown before joining with the large store_sales fact table. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x due to reduced hash table sizes and earlier filtering of dimension tables.
