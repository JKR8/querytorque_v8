You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_22
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 22 in stream 0 using template query22.tpl
select i_product_name
             ,i_brand
             ,i_class
             ,i_category
             ,avg(inv_quantity_on_hand) qoh
       from inventory
           ,date_dim
           ,item
       where inv_date_sk=d_date_sk
              and inv_item_sk=i_item_sk
              and d_month_seq between 1188 and 1188 + 11
       group by rollup(i_product_name
                       ,i_brand
                       ,i_class
                       ,i_category)
order by qoh, i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 22 in stream 0 using template query22.tpl

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates down, and isolating date ranges early to reduce fact table joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
)
SELECT
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category,
    AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM inventory
INNER JOIN filtered_dates ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
INNER JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP (
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
)
ORDER BY
    qoh,
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure with CTEs to isolate filtered dimension tables, materialize intermediate results, and handle date ranges separately before joining with fact tables.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
),
filtered_inventory AS (
  SELECT inv_item_sk, inv_quantity_on_hand
  FROM inventory
  JOIN filtered_dates ON inventory.inv_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
)
SELECT
  i_product_name,
  i_brand,
  i_class,
  i_category,
  AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM filtered_inventory
JOIN item ON filtered_inventory.inv_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP (
  i_product_name,
  i_brand,
  i_class,
  i_category
)
ORDER BY
  qoh,
  i_product_name,
  i_brand,
  i_class,
  i_category
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Use aggressive prefetching by pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs, and consolidate operations into single-pass aggregation to minimize scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
),
prejoined_inventory AS (
  SELECT 
    inv_item_sk,
    inv_quantity_on_hand
  FROM inventory
  JOIN filtered_dates ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
)
SELECT
  i_product_name,
  i_brand,
  i_class,
  i_category,
  AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM prejoined_inventory
JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY
  ROLLUP (
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
  )
ORDER BY
  qoh,
  i_product_name,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Strategy hint**: Apply structural query transformations by converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, decorrelating subqueries, and rethinking intersection patterns for better join planning.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
)
SELECT
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category,
    AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM inventory
JOIN filtered_dates ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP (
        i_product_name,
        i_brand,
        i_class,
        i_category
    )
ORDER BY
    qoh,
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql

    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1199
),
filtered_inventory AS (
    SELECT 
        inv_item_sk,
        inv_quantity_on_hand
    FROM inventory
    WHERE inv_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates)
)
SELECT
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category,
    AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM filtered_inventory
JOIN item ON filtered_inventory.inv_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP (
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
)
ORDER BY
    qoh,
    i_product_name,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
