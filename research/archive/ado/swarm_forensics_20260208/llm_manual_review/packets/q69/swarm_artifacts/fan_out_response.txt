WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters down to dimension tables early and materialize repeated date filter to reduce row counts before joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into CTEs to enable reuse and reduce redundant joins across multiple sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_decorrelate_multi_cte
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, composite_decorrelate_union, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Decorrelate subqueries by precomputing customer sets for each sales channel in separate CTEs, using a shared date CTE, and prefetch fact joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Explore transforming NOT EXISTS to set operations (INTERSECT/EXCEPT) and consolidating multiple fact table scans into a single pass.
