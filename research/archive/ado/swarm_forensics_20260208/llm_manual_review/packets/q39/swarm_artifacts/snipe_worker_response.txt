**Changes**: Split the generic `inv` CTE into two specialized CTEs (`inv_m1` and `inv_m2`) that embed the month filters (`d_moy = 1` and `d_moy = 2`) directly in their definitions, eliminating the need to compute and filter all months. Replaced implicit joins with explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.5x by avoiding full monthly aggregation and reducing intermediate result sizes through early filtering.
