**Changes:**
Created a shared CTE `week_dates` to compute the target week's date keys once, then used explicit JOINs to push this filter early into each sales CTE, eliminating repeated correlated subqueries and reducing fact table scans.

**Expected speedup:** ~2x-3x from eliminating redundant date calculations and enabling early filtering of large fact tables.
