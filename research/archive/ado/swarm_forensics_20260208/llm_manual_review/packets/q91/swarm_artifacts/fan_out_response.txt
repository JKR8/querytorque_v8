WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply dimension table filtering first to reduce rows early, push predicates down, and materialize filtered subsets to avoid repeated computation during joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate all filtered dimension tables (including date_dim) into separate CTEs before joining, enabling parallel filtering and reuse of dimension subsets.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimension CTEs with the fact table in stages, and consolidate operations to minimize passes over large tables while maintaining filter pushdown.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structure_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches, apply decorrelation techniques, and experiment with EXISTS transformations for better join planning.
