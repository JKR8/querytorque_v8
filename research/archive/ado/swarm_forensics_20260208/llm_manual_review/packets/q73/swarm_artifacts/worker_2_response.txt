**Changes**: Isolated dimension table filtering into three separate CTEs (`filtered_date`, `filtered_store`, `filtered_household_demographics`) before joining to `store_sales`, enabling parallel filter optimization. Also moved the `cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5` filter into a `HAVING` clause to reduce the result set before joining with `customer`.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5-2x due to early reduction of fact table joins through small dimension hash tables and parallel filter execution.
