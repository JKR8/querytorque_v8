  "explanation": "Applied star schema optimization by creating CTEs for filtered dimension tables before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the amount of data processed in the join by applying selective filters on customer_demographics, date_dim, store, and item tables early. All literal values are preserved exactly as in the original query."
