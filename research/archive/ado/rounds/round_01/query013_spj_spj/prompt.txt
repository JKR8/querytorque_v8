## Example: Dsb Predicate Correlation Stats (DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
-- PostgreSQL assumes independence, underestimates
      SELECT * FROM customer c
      WHERE c.c_birth_country = 'United States'
        AND c.c_current_addr_sk IN (
            SELECT ca_address_sk FROM customer_address 
            WHERE ca_state = 'CA'
        );


**Key insight:** DSB explicitly introduces cross-table correlations. Create
      statistics after identifying correlated filter patterns.

## Example: Aggregate Push Below Join (AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT c.region, SUM(o.amount)
      FROM customers c
      JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
      GROUP BY c.region;


**Key insight:** Join followed by aggregation where one side contributes only to
      aggregate, not to grouping.

---

## Example: Subquery Offset Zero Barrier (SUBQUERY_OFFSET_ZERO_BARRIER)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
-- Subquery may be "pulled up" and reordered
      SELECT * FROM fact_table f
      JOIN (
          SELECT * FROM dim_table WHERE active = true
      ) d ON f.dim_id = d.id;


**Key insight:** - Force specific join order without global setting changes
      - Subquery results should compute before joining
      - Debug plans by isolating subquery execution

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)
