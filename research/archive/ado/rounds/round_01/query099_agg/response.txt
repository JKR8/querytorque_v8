  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter into a CTE (filtered_dates) to reduce the join size early. This follows the Date CTE Isolation pattern (QT-OPT-003) and star-schema best practice where selective dimension filters should be applied before joining to large fact tables. All other filters remain pushed down to their respective tables. This reduces the amount of data flowing through the joins while preserving exact semantics."
