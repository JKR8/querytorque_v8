  "explanation": "1) rs_01 decorrelates the subquery by pre-computing state averages in a CTE, eliminating correlated execution. 2) rs_02 pushes the 'VA' state filter into the customer_total_return CTE before aggregation, reducing data volume. 3) rs_03 isolates the date_dim filter into a CTE to enable early filtering and better join ordering. These transforms address the correlated subquery and pushdown opportunities while preserving all literal values as required."
