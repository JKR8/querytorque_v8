  "explanation": "Created CTEs for dimension tables with selective filters (date_dim, item, customer, customer_address) to apply filters early before joining with the large fact table. This follows star schema best practice by reducing the fact table scan through early dimension filtering. The OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint is not triggered as we're not splitting OR conditions. All literal values are preserved exactly."
