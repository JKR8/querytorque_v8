## Example: Star Schema Dimension Filter First (STAR_SCHEMA_DIMENSION_FILTER_FIRST)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
-- May scan fact table first
      SELECT f.*, d1.name, d2.category
      FROM fact_sales f
      JOIN dim_date d1 ON f.date_id = d1.id
      JOIN dim_product d2 ON f.product_id = d2.id
      WHERE d1.year = 2025
        AND d2.category = 'Electronics';


**Key insight:** Star schema queries with selective dimension filters where optimizer
      scans fact table first instead of filtering dimensions.

## Example: Join Order Collapse Limit (JOIN_ORDER_COLLAPSE_LIMIT)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
-- PostgreSQL may reorder JOINs arbitrarily
      SELECT * FROM orders o
      JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
      JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id
      WHERE c.region = 'WEST';


**Key insight:** - Optimizer consistently chooses suboptimal join order
      - Specific knowledge about data distribution optimizer lacks
      - Complex queries where planning time is excessive

---

## Example: Subquery Offset Zero Barrier (SUBQUERY_OFFSET_ZERO_BARRIER)
Verified speedup: unknown

### Input:
[main_query]:
-- Subquery may be "pulled up" and reordered
      SELECT * FROM fact_table f
      JOIN (
          SELECT * FROM dim_table WHERE active = true
      ) d ON f.dim_id = d.id;


**Key insight:** - Force specific join order without global setting changes
      - Subquery results should compute before joining
      - Debug plans by isolating subquery execution

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:
