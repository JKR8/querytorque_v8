Looking at this query, I can identify several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The `date_dim` table is joined in all three UNION branches with year filters (2001, 2002) that can be isolated
2. **Pushdown Opportunities**: Filters on `d_year` are currently applied after aggregation in the CTE, but should be pushed down before aggregation
3. **Subquery flattening**: The `all_sales` CTE contains complex UNION queries that could be optimized

However, I need to be careful about:
- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: Must keep exact literal values `'Music'`, `2002`, `2002 - 1`, `0.9`, `33 * 0.01`, `53 * 0.01`, `17, 48, 50, 56, 68`
- **OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**: The `IN` clause with 5 values should NOT be converted to ORs and then UNION

Here's my optimized rewrite:

  "explanation": "1) Added date_filter CTE to isolate date_dim filtering for years 2001 and 2002 before joining with large fact tables (catalog_sales, store_sales, web_sales). This reduces the join size early.\n2) Used UNION ALL instead of UNION (since branches are disjoint by nature - catalog/store/web sales are separate).\n3) Kept all literal values exactly as in original query.\n4) Maintained the same structure for the main query self-join and ratio calculation.\n5) The date_filter CTE acts as a dimension filter that reduces fact table scans early, similar to star schema optimization."

**Key optimizations applied:**
1. **Date CTE Isolation**: Created a `date_filter` CTE that selects only years 2001 and 2002 before joining with large fact tables
2. **Pushdown**: The year filters are now applied in the date_filter CTE instead of after aggregation
3. **Union optimization**: Changed `UNION` to `UNION ALL` since the three sales channels are mutually exclusive
4. **Structure preservation**: Maintained all original business logic, literal values, and calculation methods

**Why this should be faster:**
- The date_filter CTE reduces the date_dim table from potentially thousands of rows to just 2 years before joining
- Each fact table now joins with a much smaller date dimension (2 rows instead of thousands)
- UNION ALL is faster than UNION because it doesn't need to deduplicate
- The aggregation in the final all_sales CTE now processes less data because we filtered by year early

**Risks:**
- Medium risk because we changed UNION to UNION ALL, but this should be safe since catalog_sales, store_sales, and web_sales are typically distinct tables without overlap
- The query structure is more complex with multiple CTEs, but this should help the optimizer
