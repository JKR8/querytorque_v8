# DuckDB Configuration
# DB-specific hints for SQL optimization

  name: duckdb
  version: "1.0+"

# DuckDB-specific optimization hints
hints:
  - id: materialization
    text: "DuckDB benefits from explicit CTE materialization for repeated scans."

  - id: parallel_hash_join
    text: "DuckDB uses parallel hash joins effectively. Converting nested loops to hash joins helps."

  - id: filter_pushdown
    text: "DuckDB's optimizer handles filter pushdown well, but explicit early filtering in CTEs still helps."

# Syntax notes for this DB
syntax_notes:
  - "DuckDB supports standard SQL with some extensions"
  - "INTERSECT and EXCEPT work correctly with NULLs"
  - "Window functions are highly optimized"

# Known limitations
limitations:
  - "No index hints (DuckDB doesn't use traditional indexes)"
  - "No query plan hints"

# What works well
strengths:
  - "Columnar storage - filter pushdown is very effective"
  - "Parallel execution - large scans benefit from early filtering"
  - "Hash aggregation - predicate pushdown before GROUP BY"
