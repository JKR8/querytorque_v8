Optimize this SQL query.

## Execution Plan

**Operators by cost:**
- SEQ_SCAN (customer): 55.1% cost, 1,998,280 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer_address): 18.0% cost, 440,097 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer_demographics): 17.7% cost, 1,918,565 rows
- FILTER: 2.7% cost, 109,632 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 2.6% cost, 1,879 rows

**Table scans:**
- call_center: 27 rows (NO FILTER)
- household_demographics: 1,180 rows ← FILTERED by hd_buy_potential>='1001-5000' AND hd_buy_potential
- customer_demographics: 1,918,565 rows ← FILTERED by cd_demo_sk<=1920798
- customer_address: 440,097 rows ← FILTERED by ca_gmt_offset=-6.00
- customer: 1,998,280 rows ← FILTERED by c_customer_sk>=2 AND c_customer_sk<=1999998
- catalog_returns: 1,905 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 30 rows ← FILTERED by ['d_year=2001', 'd_moy=11']

## Optimization Patterns

These patterns have produced >2x speedups:

1. **Dimension filter hoisting**: If a filtered dimension is in main_query but the CTE aggregates fact data that COULD be filtered by it (via FK), move the dimension join+filter INTO the CTE to filter early.

2. **Correlated subquery to window function**: A correlated subquery computes an aggregate per group. Fix: Replace with a window function in the CTE (e.g., `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)`).

3. **Join elimination**: A table is joined only to validate a foreign key exists, but no columns from it are used. Fix: Remove the join, add `WHERE fk_column IS NOT NULL`.

4. **UNION ALL decomposition**: Complex OR conditions cause full scans. Fix: Split into separate queries with simple filters, UNION ALL results.

5. **Scan consolidation**: Same table scanned multiple times with different filters. Fix: Single scan with CASE WHEN expressions to compute multiple aggregates conditionally.

**Verify**: Optimized query must return identical results.

## SQL
```sql
-- start query 91 in stream 0 using template query91.tpl
select  
        cc_call_center_id Call_Center,
        cc_name Call_Center_Name,
        cc_manager Manager,
        sum(cr_net_loss) Returns_Loss
from
        call_center,
        catalog_returns,
        date_dim,
        customer,
        customer_address,
        customer_demographics,
        household_demographics
where
        cr_call_center_sk       = cc_call_center_sk
and     cr_returned_date_sk     = d_date_sk
and     cr_returning_customer_sk= c_customer_sk
and     cd_demo_sk              = c_current_cdemo_sk
and     hd_demo_sk              = c_current_hdemo_sk
and     ca_address_sk           = c_current_addr_sk
and     d_year                  = 2001 
and     d_moy                   = 11
and     ( (cd_marital_status       = 'M' and cd_education_status     = 'Unknown')
        or(cd_marital_status       = 'W' and cd_education_status     = 'Advanced Degree'))
and     hd_buy_potential like '1001-5000%'
and     ca_gmt_offset           = -6
group by cc_call_center_id,cc_name,cc_manager,cd_marital_status,cd_education_status
order by sum(cr_net_loss) desc;

## Output

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "operations": [...],
  "semantic_warnings": [],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

### Operations

| Op | Fields | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `add_cte` | `after`, `name`, `sql` | Insert new CTE |
| `delete_cte` | `name` | Remove CTE |
| `replace_cte` | `name`, `sql` | Replace entire CTE body |
| `replace_clause` | `target`, `sql` | Replace clause (`""` to remove) |
| `patch` | `target`, `patches[]` | Snippet search/replace |

### Example
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "replace_cte", "name": "my_cte", "sql": "SELECT sk, SUM(val) FROM t WHERE sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY sk"}
  ],
  "semantic_warnings": ["Removed join - added IS NOT NULL to preserve filtering"],
  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary dimension join, using FK directly"
}
```

### Block ID Syntax
```
{cte}.select    {cte}.from    {cte}.where    {cte}.group_by    {cte}.having
main_query.union[N].select    main_query.union[N].from    ...
```

### Rules
1. **Return 1-5 operations maximum** - focus on highest-impact changes first
2. Operations apply sequentially
3. `patch.search` must be unique within target clause
4. `add_cte.sql` = query body only (no CTE name)
5. All CTE refs must resolve after ops
6. When removing a join, update column references (e.g., `c_customer_sk` → `ss_customer_sk AS c_customer_sk`)

The system will iterate if more optimization is possible. You don't need to fix everything at once.
