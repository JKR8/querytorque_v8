Optimize this SQL query.

## Execution Plan

**Operators by cost:**
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 46.5% cost, 576,153 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 45.3% cost, 576,153 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 1.4% cost, 67,780 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 1.2% cost, 67,780 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (time_dim): 0.6% cost, 7,200 rows

**Table scans:**
- time_dim: 7,200 rows ← FILTERED by t_hour>=10 AND t_hour<=11
- web_sales: 576,153 rows (NO FILTER)
- household_demographics: 720 rows ← FILTERED by hd_dep_count=2
- web_page: 38 rows ← FILTERED by wp_char_count>=5000 AND wp_char_count<=5200
- time_dim: 7,200 rows ← FILTERED by t_hour>=16 AND t_hour<=17
- web_sales: 576,153 rows (NO FILTER)
- household_demographics: 720 rows ← FILTERED by hd_dep_count=2
- web_page: 38 rows ← FILTERED by wp_char_count>=5000 AND wp_char_count<=5200

## Optimization Patterns

These patterns have produced >2x speedups:

1. **Dimension filter hoisting**: If a filtered dimension is in main_query but the CTE aggregates fact data that COULD be filtered by it (via FK), move the dimension join+filter INTO the CTE to filter early.

2. **Correlated subquery to window function**: A correlated subquery computes an aggregate per group. Fix: Replace with a window function in the CTE (e.g., `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)`).

3. **Join elimination**: A table is joined only to validate a foreign key exists, but no columns from it are used. Fix: Remove the join, add `WHERE fk_column IS NOT NULL`.

4. **UNION ALL decomposition**: Complex OR conditions cause full scans. Fix: Split into separate queries with simple filters, UNION ALL results.

5. **Scan consolidation**: Same table scanned multiple times with different filters. Fix: Single scan with CASE WHEN expressions to compute multiple aggregates conditionally.

**Verify**: Optimized query must return identical results.

## SQL
```sql
-- start query 90 in stream 0 using template query90.tpl
select cast(amc as decimal(15,4))/cast(pmc as decimal(15,4)) am_pm_ratio
 from ( select count(*) amc
       from web_sales, household_demographics , time_dim, web_page
       where ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
         and ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
         and ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
         and time_dim.t_hour between 10 and 10+1
         and household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 2
         and web_page.wp_char_count between 5000 and 5200) at_tbl,
      ( select count(*) pmc
       from web_sales, household_demographics , time_dim, web_page
       where ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk
         and ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
         and ws_web_page_sk = web_page.wp_web_page_sk
         and time_dim.t_hour between 16 and 16+1
         and household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 2
         and web_page.wp_char_count between 5000 and 5200) pt
 order by am_pm_ratio
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 90 in stream 0 using template query90.tpl

## Output

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "operations": [...],
  "semantic_warnings": [],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

### Operations

| Op | Fields | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `add_cte` | `after`, `name`, `sql` | Insert new CTE |
| `delete_cte` | `name` | Remove CTE |
| `replace_cte` | `name`, `sql` | Replace entire CTE body |
| `replace_clause` | `target`, `sql` | Replace clause (`""` to remove) |
| `patch` | `target`, `patches[]` | Snippet search/replace |

### Example
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "replace_cte", "name": "my_cte", "sql": "SELECT sk, SUM(val) FROM t WHERE sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY sk"}
  ],
  "semantic_warnings": ["Removed join - added IS NOT NULL to preserve filtering"],
  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary dimension join, using FK directly"
}
```

### Block ID Syntax
```
{cte}.select    {cte}.from    {cte}.where    {cte}.group_by    {cte}.having
main_query.union[N].select    main_query.union[N].from    ...
```

### Rules
1. **Return 1-5 operations maximum** - focus on highest-impact changes first
2. Operations apply sequentially
3. `patch.search` must be unique within target clause
4. `add_cte.sql` = query body only (no CTE name)
5. All CTE refs must resolve after ops
6. When removing a join, update column references (e.g., `c_customer_sk` → `ss_customer_sk AS c_customer_sk`)

The system will iterate if more optimization is possible. You don't need to fix everything at once.
