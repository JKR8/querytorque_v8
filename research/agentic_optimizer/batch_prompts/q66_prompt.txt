Optimize this SQL query.

## Execution Plan

**Operators by cost:**
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 58.0% cost, 42,938 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (catalog_sales): 28.2% cost, 85,468 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 1.7% cost, 15 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 1.3% cost, 12,795 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 1.1% cost, 15 rows

**Table scans:**
- time_dim: 28,801 rows ← FILTERED by t_time>=48821 AND t_time<=77621
- web_sales: 42,938 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 365 rows ← FILTERED by d_year=1998
- ship_mode: 20 rows ← FILTERED by optional: sm_carrier IN ('GREAT EASTERN', 'LATVIAN
- warehouse: 15 rows (NO FILTER)
- time_dim: 28,801 rows ← FILTERED by t_time>=48821 AND t_time<=77621
- catalog_sales: 85,468 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 365 rows ← FILTERED by d_year=1998
- ship_mode: 20 rows ← FILTERED by optional: sm_carrier IN ('GREAT EASTERN', 'LATVIAN
- warehouse: 15 rows (NO FILTER)

## Optimization Patterns

These patterns have produced >2x speedups:

1. **Dimension filter hoisting**: If a filtered dimension is in main_query but the CTE aggregates fact data that COULD be filtered by it (via FK), move the dimension join+filter INTO the CTE to filter early.

2. **Correlated subquery to window function**: A correlated subquery computes an aggregate per group. Fix: Replace with a window function in the CTE (e.g., `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)`).

3. **Join elimination**: A table is joined only to validate a foreign key exists, but no columns from it are used. Fix: Remove the join, add `WHERE fk_column IS NOT NULL`.

4. **UNION ALL decomposition**: Complex OR conditions cause full scans. Fix: Split into separate queries with simple filters, UNION ALL results.

5. **Scan consolidation**: Same table scanned multiple times with different filters. Fix: Single scan with CASE WHEN expressions to compute multiple aggregates conditionally.

**Verify**: Optimized query must return identical results.

## Output

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "operations": [...],
  "semantic_warnings": [],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

### Operations

| Op | Fields | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `add_cte` | `after`, `name`, `sql` | Insert new CTE |
| `delete_cte` | `name` | Remove CTE |
| `replace_cte` | `name`, `sql` | Replace entire CTE body |
| `replace_clause` | `target`, `sql` | Replace clause (`""` to remove) |
| `patch` | `target`, `patches[]` | Snippet search/replace |

### Example
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "replace_cte", "name": "my_cte", "sql": "SELECT sk, SUM(val) FROM t WHERE sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY sk"}
  ],
  "semantic_warnings": ["Removed join - added IS NOT NULL to preserve filtering"],
  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary dimension join, using FK directly"
}
```

### Block ID Syntax
```
{cte}.select    {cte}.from    {cte}.where    {cte}.group_by    {cte}.having
main_query.union[N].select    main_query.union[N].from    ...
```

### Rules
1. **Return 1-5 operations maximum** - focus on highest-impact changes first
2. Operations apply sequentially
3. `patch.search` must be unique within target clause
4. `add_cte.sql` = query body only (no CTE name)
5. All CTE refs must resolve after ops
6. When removing a join, update column references (e.g., `c_customer_sk` → `ss_customer_sk AS c_customer_sk`)

The system will iterate if more optimization is possible. You don't need to fix everything at once.
