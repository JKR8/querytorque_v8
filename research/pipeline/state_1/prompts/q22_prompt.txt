You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

RULES:
- Maximize execution speed while preserving semantic invariants (output columns, grain, total result rows).
- Group dependent changes into a single rewrite_set.
- Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` not `cte1`).
- If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not in the allowed list, label it "semantic_rewrite".

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

  AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM inventory, date_dim, item
WHERE
  inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
GROUP BY
  ROLLUP (

### Cost Attribution
[main_query]: 100.0% cost, ~26520000 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[inventory], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[item]]

### Execution Plan
```
Operators by cost:
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 94.9% cost, 203,740 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(inventory): 4.3% cost, 26,520,000 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 0.4% cost, 26,520,000 rows

- item x1: 102,000 rows (no filter)
- date_dim x1: 73,049 → 365 rows (filtered)

- HASH_JOIN: inventory x ? -> 26,520,000 rows (late)
```

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table

## Previous Attempts

- baseline: 1.00x [none] NEUTRAL
- kimi: 0.98x [none] NEUTRAL
- v2_standard: 1.00x [date_cte_isolate] NEUTRAL
- retry3w_2: 1.69x [none] WIN
- dsr1: 1.10x [prefetch_fact_join] WIN

**Worked**: prefetch_fact_join
**No effect**: date_cte_isolate

**Recommended patterns** (details in Examples section below):
- **deferred_window_aggregation** (1.36x) — When multiple CTEs each perform GROUP BY + WINDOW (cumulative sum), then are joined with FULL OUTER JOIN followed by another WINDOW pass for NULL carry-forward: defer the WINDOW out of the CTEs, join daily totals, then compute cumulative sums once on the joined result.
- **prefetch_fact_join** (3.77x) — Pre-filter dimension table into CTE, then pre-join with fact table in second CTE before joining other dimensions.

          )x )y

### Optimized SQL:
```sql

SELECT * FROM (SELECT item_sk, d_date, web_sales, store_sales, MAX(web_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative, MAX(store_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN NOT web.item_sk IS NULL THEN web.item_sk ELSE store.item_sk END AS item_sk, CASE WHEN NOT web.d_date IS NULL THEN web.d_date ELSE store.d_date END AS d_date, web.cume_sales AS web_sales, store.cume_sales AS store_sales FROM web_v1 AS web FULL OUTER JOIN store_v1 AS store ON (web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date)) AS x) AS y WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative ORDER BY item_sk, d_date LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** When CTEs compute GROUP BY + WINDOW (running sum), then FULL OUTER JOIN introduces NULLs requiring a MAX() OVER() carry-forward pass: remove WINDOW from the CTEs (keep only GROUP BY for daily totals), join the daily totals, then compute SUM() OVER() once on the joined result. SUM() naturally skips NULLs, so the carry-forward is free. Reduces 3 WINDOW passes (2 in CTEs + 1 MAX carry-forward) to 1.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use when the CTE window function is referenced by other consumers besides the final join (the cumulative value is needed elsewhere). Do not use when the window function is not a monotonically accumulating SUM - e.g., AVG, COUNT, or non-monotonic window functions require separate computation. Only applies when the join is FULL OUTER and the carry-forward window is MAX/LAST_VALUE over a cumulative sum.

```

**Key insight:** First CTE filters the dimension (date_dim). Second CTE pre-joins this with the fact table (store_sales). This creates a smaller intermediate result before joining with other dimension tables. The pre-join materializes the filtered fact rows, making subsequent joins faster.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use on queries with baseline runtime under 50ms — CTE materialization overhead dominates on fast queries. Do not use on window-function-dominated queries where filtering is not the bottleneck. Avoid on queries with 5+ table joins and complex inter-table predicates where forcing join order via CTEs prevents the optimizer from choosing a better plan. Caused 0.50x on Q25 (fast baseline query), 0.87x on Q51 (window-function bottleneck), and 0.77x on Q72 (complex multi-table join reordering).

## Constraints

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD** [HIGH]: If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE** [HIGH]: Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD** [HIGH]: Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES** [HIGH]: When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS** [CRITICAL]: Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.
