  "explanation": "Two complementary optimizations: (1) Pushdown: Add d_year IN (2001,2002) filter directly into the all_sales CTE to reduce data volume before aggregation - this leverages the fact that main query only uses years 2001 and 2002. (2) Date CTE Isolation: Create a filtered_dates CTE to pre-filter date_dim and join early with fact tables, plus filter item table once via CTE. This reduces the size of fact tables before complex UNION/aggregation operations."
