Looking at this query, I can see two main optimization opportunities: the OR condition on `household_demographics` can be split into UNION ALL branches, and the date_dim filter can be isolated into a CTE. The execution plan shows store_sales is the most expensive scan at 84.2% cost.

  "explanation": "Split OR condition on household_demographics into two UNION ALL branches to allow more efficient filtering and index usage. Isolated date_dim and store filters into CTEs to push them early in each branch. The UNION ALL avoids duplicate rows by making branches mutually exclusive: branch1 takes hd_dep_count = 6, branch2 takes hd_vehicle_count > 2 AND (hd_dep_count != 6 OR hd_dep_count IS NULL). This reduces the full table scan cost on store_sales by enabling predicate pushdown and potentially better join strategies for each branch."
