Looking at this query, I see several opportunities for optimization:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The date_dim filter (`d_qoy = 2 AND d_year = 2001`) is highly selective (73,049 → 91 rows) and can be isolated
2. **OR to UNION ALL**: The complex OR condition with subquery can be decomposed
3. **Subquery materialization**: The IN subquery references a static list of i_item_sk values

The biggest win appears to be decomposing the OR condition since it combines two unrelated filters (one on ca_zip, one on i_item_id). Let me apply these transforms:

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Decomposed the OR condition into two UNION ALL branches: one for the zip code filter and one for the item ID subquery filter. This allows each branch to use optimal indexes and avoid the expensive OR evaluation. The item_list CTE materializes the static subquery result. The date_filter CTE isolates the selective date dimension filter. Added NOT IN clause to item_branch to avoid duplicate rows that satisfy both conditions (though none should exist based on data characteristics)."
}
```

**Key insight**: The OR condition combines two unrelated filters on different tables (customer_address and item). By splitting into UNION ALL, we allow the optimizer to choose optimal execution plans for each case. The date filter is extracted into a CTE to reduce the web_sales table early. The static item_sk list is pre-materialized. This transform is particularly effective because the OR prevents efficient index usage in the original query.
