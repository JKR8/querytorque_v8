  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered date_dim (30 rows) and filtered item (1,836 rows) based on their selective predicates. Pre-joined these CTEs with store_sales to reduce the fact table from 345M rows to ~880K rows early. This avoids scanning the full store_sales table before applying dimension filters."
