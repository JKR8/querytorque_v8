  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered date_dim and item tables to isolate their filters early. This prevents scanning the full 345M-row store_sales table before applying date and item filters. The optimizer can now join the pre-filtered dimension tables (30 rows from date_dim, 1800 rows from item) with store_sales, reducing the intermediate join result from 879K rows to only those matching both dimension filters."
