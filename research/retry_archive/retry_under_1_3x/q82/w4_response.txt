  "explanation": "The original query performs a 4-table join with expensive sequential scans and misestimated cardinalities. First rewrite (rs_01) isolates the date filter into a CTE and pushes down item filters early, reducing rows flowing into joins. It also converts the store_sales join to EXISTS since we only need existence check (GROUP BY on item columns). Second rewrite (rs_02) further optimizes by flattening into a single query with EXISTS subqueries, eliminating the need for GROUP BY entirely while preserving the same distinct item semantics. This reduces I/O by avoiding materialization of intermediate join results and leverages potential indexes on join keys."
