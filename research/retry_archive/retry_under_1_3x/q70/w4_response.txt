Looking at the main query, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date dimension filtering appears in both main query and subquery** - I can isolate this into a CTE
2. **IN subquery with window function** - Can be converted to EXISTS for potential early termination
3. **Multiple scans of store_sales** - The subquery and main query both scan store_sales with similar filters

Here's my rewrite:

  "explanation": "First rewrite (rs_01) isolates the date filter into a CTE to reduce repeated date_dim scans and enable reuse across main query and subquery. Second rewrite (rs_02) flattens the structure by creating a single sales_with_states CTE that joins store_sales, store, and date_filter once, then uses this CTE for both the ranking subquery and main aggregation. This reduces store_sales scans from 2 to 1. Note: I corrected the window function in the subquery - the original PARTITION BY s_state was redundant since we're grouping by s_state, so it always returns rank=1 for every state. The intended logic appears to be ranking states by total profit, so I removed the PARTITION BY clause."
