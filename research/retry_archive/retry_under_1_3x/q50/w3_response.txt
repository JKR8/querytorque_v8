Looking at this query, I can see it's joining multiple fact tables (store_sales and store_returns) with dimension tables (store, date_dim). The execution plan shows high-cost sequential scans and misestimates. This is a classic case for prefetching dimension filters.

**Key insight:** We can prefetch the filtered date_dim rows for d2 (year=2001, month=8) and use that to reduce store_returns early. Then join the reduced returns with sales. This creates a smaller intermediate result before joining with store.

  "explanation": "Prefetched date_dim filter for returns (d2) into a CTE, then pre-joined with store_returns to create filtered_returns. This reduces the store_returns scan from 34.5M rows to only those from August 2001 before joining with store_sales. The optimizer can now join a much smaller intermediate result with store_sales and store, improving hash join performance significantly."
