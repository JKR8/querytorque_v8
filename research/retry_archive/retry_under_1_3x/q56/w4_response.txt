  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Created materialized CTEs for the repeated subquery patterns (date_dim, customer_address, item filters) that appear in both ss and ws CTEs. This replaces 6 scans of item (3 per CTE) with 1, and 3 scans of date_dim with 1. 2) Used date_cte_isolate to push the date filter early into the join, allowing better join ordering and reducing fact table rows early. The filtered_items CTE eliminates the IN subquery pattern by materializing the filtered items once. Combined, these reduce scans from 15+ to ~5 with the same semantics."
