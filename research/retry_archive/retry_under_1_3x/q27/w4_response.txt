Looking at this query pattern, I can identify a key optimization opportunity:

**Opportunity**: The `[main_query]` scans the `[results]` CTE three times (once per UNION ALL branch), performing similar aggregations each time. This can be consolidated into a single pass using `GROUPING SETS` or `ROLLUP` with conditional logic.

**Analysis**:
1. The `[results]` CTE contains 95.8% of the cost and is scanned 3 times in the UNION ALL
2. Each branch does: `AVG(agg1)`, `AVG(agg2)`, `AVG(agg3)`, `AVG(agg4)`
3. The branches differ only in grouping columns:
   - Branch 1: GROUP BY i_item_id, s_state (with s_state='TN')
   - Branch 2: GROUP BY i_item_id only
   - Branch 3: Overall aggregates (no GROUP BY)

  "explanation": "1. rs_01 consolidates three scans of the results CTE into a single pass using GROUPING SETS to compute all three aggregation levels simultaneously. This reduces I/O on the large store_sales table from 3 scans to 1 scan. 2. rs_02 isolates the date_dim filter into a CTE to push the year filter earlier and avoid redundant date_dim lookups across joins."
}
```

**Key insights**:
1. The UNION ALL pattern with different GROUP BY levels is a classic case for GROUPING SETS
2. The `GROUPING()` function allows us to reconstruct the original s_state and g_state values
3. We can compute all AVG aggregates once and then use the grouping_id to select the appropriate grouping level
4. Date dimension filtering can be isolated early to reduce join cardinality
