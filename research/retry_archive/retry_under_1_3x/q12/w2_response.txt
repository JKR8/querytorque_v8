  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filtering into a CTE (filtered_dates) to reduce the web_sales table early from 86M rows to only those with dates in the specified range. Isolated item filtering into a CTE (filtered_items) to reduce item table to relevant categories before joining. This transforms the original 3-table join into two selective CTEs that filter large tables before the expensive aggregation and window function operations."
