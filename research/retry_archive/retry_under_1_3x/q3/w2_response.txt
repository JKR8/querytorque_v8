  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim and item dimension filtering into separate CTEs before joining with store_sales. This reduces the store_sales scan from full table (345M rows) to only rows matching filtered dates (Nov) and items (manufacturer 128). The date CTE also projects d_year early, eliminating the need for a second date_dim join. This follows pattern QT-OPT-003 (Date CTE Isolation) and dimension_cte_isolate principles."
