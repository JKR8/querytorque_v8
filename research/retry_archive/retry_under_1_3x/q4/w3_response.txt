  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filtering into a CTE and prefetched it with each fact table separately. This reduces 6 separate date_dim scans to 1, and allows each UNION ALL branch to be computed independently with filtered date_dim rows. The date CTE only needs d_date_sk for joins, drastically reducing the date_dim scan size from 73k rows to ~730 rows (2001-2002). Each fact table join now uses this small filtered dates CTE instead of scanning the full date_dim."
