Looking at this query, I can see several optimization opportunities. The main issue is that it's scanning all tables without pushing filters early, and the customer_address table is being filtered late in the join sequence. Let me create a comprehensive rewrite set that pushes filters down and isolates the date dimension.

```json

        "filtered_customer": "SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk, c_current_addr_sk, c_birth_year FROM customer WHERE c_birth_month IN (1, 6, 8, 9, 12, 2)",
        "filtered_address": "SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county FROM customer_address WHERE ca_state IN ('MS', 'IN', 'ND', 'OK', 'NM', 'VA', 'MS')",
        "qualified_sales": "SELECT cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price, cs_net_profit, cs_item_sk, cs_bill_customer_sk FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "qualified_sales_with_cd1": "SELECT qs.*, cd1.cd_dep_count FROM qualified_sales qs JOIN filtered_cd1 cd1 ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd1.cd_demo_sk",

        "qualified_sales_with_address": "SELECT qs.*, ca.ca_country, ca.ca_state, ca.ca_county FROM qualified_sales_with_customer qs JOIN filtered_address ca ON qs.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk",
        "full_qualified_sales": "SELECT qs.*, i.i_item_id FROM qualified_sales_with_address qs JOIN item i ON qs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk",

      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same grouping",
        "same output columns",
        "same ordering"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "3.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The original query performs sequential scans on all tables without pushing filters early. This rewrite creates filtered CTEs for dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics cd1, customer, customer_address) that apply predicates before joining. The date filter is isolated first to reduce catalog_sales rows early. Each dimension table is filtered before joining, reducing intermediate result sizes. The customer_address filter (ca_state IN) is applied early instead of late in the join sequence. This reduces the 172M row catalog_sales scan to only sales from 1998, and reduces dimension table scans by applying filters before joins."
