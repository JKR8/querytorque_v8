  "explanation": "Created CTEs for each filtered dimension (date_dim, customer_demographics cd1, customer, customer_address) to reduce early join cardinality. The main fact table (catalog_sales) is joined first with filtered date and cd1 dimensions, then with other pre-filtered dimensions. This reduces the 172M row catalog_sales scan by applying date filter early via CTE join, and filters other dimensions before expensive multi-way joins."
