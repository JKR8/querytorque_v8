  "explanation": "Transformed OR condition on promotion table (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') into three mutually exclusive UNION ALL branches. This allows each branch to use focused indexes and reduces predicate evaluation overhead. Extracted date_dim and customer_demographics filters into CTEs to avoid repeated joins. The three branches are: 1) email='N' AND event≠'N', 2) event='N' AND email≠'N', 3) both='N'. This ensures no duplicates while covering all OR cases. Also pushed down date and demographic filters early to reduce join sizes significantly."
