Looking at the query structure and execution plan, I see opportunities for optimization through early filtering and join reordering. The main issue is that `inventory` is being scanned multiple times with poor row estimates, and the date filter is only applied after large joins.

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": ["date_cte_isolate", "early_filter", "reorder_join"],
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2000-05-25' AS DATE) AND CAST('2000-07-24' AS DATE)",
        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM item WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 62 AND 92 AND i_manufact_id IN (129, 270, 821, 423)",
        "filtered_inventory": "SELECT inv_item_sk FROM inventory JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500",
        "main_query": "SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM filtered_items JOIN filtered_inventory ON i_item_sk = inv_item_sk JOIN store_sales ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "same result rows after aggregation",
        "join semantics preserved"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "3.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The rewrite creates three CTEs to apply filters early and optimize join order: (1) filtered_dates isolates the date_dim scan to 61 rows, (2) filtered_items reduces item table from 54k to ~1.8k rows with price/manufacturer filters, (3) filtered_inventory joins inventory with dates early to reduce scan from 591M to filtered rows. The main query then joins these pre-filtered results with store_sales. This transforms the expensive sequential scans with large misestimates into targeted filtered joins, dramatically reducing intermediate row counts."
