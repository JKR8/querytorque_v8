  "explanation": "Applied two sequential optimizations: 1) Date CTE isolation to filter date_dim once for years 2001-2002 instead of scanning 6 times. 2) Pushdown of sale_type and dyear filters into year_total CTE before the main query joins, dramatically reducing the cardinality of intermediate results (from ~2.7M rows to only relevant years/sale_types). These transforms work together to reduce sequential scans and hash join sizes."
