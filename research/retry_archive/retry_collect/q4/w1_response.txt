  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into a CTE to reduce join cardinality from 73,049 rows to 365 rows early. Split year_total into separate CTEs for each sale type and year combination to push year filters before aggregation. This eliminates scanning entire sales tables for all years and reduces date_dim joins by 99.5%."
