  "explanation": "rs_01 isolates the date_dim filter into a CTE, reducing 3 scans to 1 and pushing the filter early. rs_02 additionally rewrites the triple INTERSECT into a single pass with UNION ALL + GROUP BY, avoiding multiple distinct operations and intersection computations. This transforms 9 table scans (3 date_dim × 3) into 4 scans (1 date_dim + 3 sales tables) and reduces computational complexity from O(n log n) for sorts to O(n) for hashing."
