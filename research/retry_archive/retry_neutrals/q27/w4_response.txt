Looking at the query structure, I can identify two optimization opportunities: **date_cte_isolate** to filter date_dim early and reduce join cardinality, and **materialize_cte** to prevent repeated computation of the expensive results CTE across the three UNION ALL branches.

  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Isolated date_dim filter into a CTE to reduce join cardinality early (date_cte_isolate). 2) Materialized the expensive results CTE to prevent its triple computation across UNION ALL branches (materialize_cte). Together these reduce redundant work and allow the optimizer to better plan the expensive store_sales joins."
