  "explanation": "The original query had a correlated subquery that computed per-item average discount thresholds for the same date range, causing the date_dim table to be scanned twice and the web_sales table to be joined twice. By extracting the date filter into a CTE (filtered_dates) and pre-computing the per-item average thresholds in another CTE (item_avg_discount), we eliminate the correlation and allow both CTEs to be scanned once. The main query then performs a single join with these pre-computed results, avoiding repeated scans and joins while preserving exact semantics."
