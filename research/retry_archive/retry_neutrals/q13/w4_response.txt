Looking at the main query, I can identify multiple optimization opportunities:

1. **OR_TO_UNION** for the complex OR conditions on customer demographics/household demographics
2. **OR_TO_UNION** for the OR conditions on customer address and net profit  
3. **DATE_CTE_ISOLATE** for the date_dim filter
4. **PUSHDOWN** to move filters closer to table scans

The query has two independent sets of OR conditions that can be decomposed into separate UNION ALL branches. However, these are ANDed together, so we need to combine them correctly.

  "explanation": "The original query has two independent OR conditions that are ANDed together: (3 demographics OR conditions) AND (3 address/profit OR conditions). This creates 3x3=9 possible combinations. Instead of evaluating complex OR logic with multiple joins, we create 9 separate branches with precise WHERE conditions using UNION ALL. Each branch has focused predicates that allow better index utilization and predicate pushdown. The date filter is isolated into a CTE for reuse across branches. This avoids the large intermediate join result of 5M+ rows and instead processes smaller, filtered subsets."
