  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce fact table early (QT-OPT-003). Created filtered_items CTE to push i_manager_id=8 filter before joining with store_sales. The filtered_sales CTE joins store_sales with filtered dates first, creating a much smaller intermediate fact set (880K rows vs original 345M scan). This reduces the largest cost center (SEQ_SCAN on store_sales) by filtering with date dimension early."
