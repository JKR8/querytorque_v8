  "explanation": "Created filtered_date CTE to isolate date_dim scan (reducing from 73,049 rows to 30 rows). Created filtered_item CTE to isolate item scan with i_manager_id=8 filter (reducing from 102,000 to 1,836 rows). Both CTEs join with store_sales early, reducing the fact table rows processed in subsequent joins from 345M rows to only relevant sales. This allows the expensive store_sales scan to filter early using date and item keys before joining with other dimensions."
