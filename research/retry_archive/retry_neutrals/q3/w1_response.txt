  "explanation": "Pushed filters on date_dim.d_moy=11 and item.i_manufact_id=128 into separate CTEs before joining with large fact table store_sales. This reduces the store_sales scan from 345M rows to only matching rows (estimated 40K), avoiding full table scan and reducing hash join sizes. Follows pattern QT-OPT-003 (Date CTE Isolation) and applies same early filtering to item dimension."
