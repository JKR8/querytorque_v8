  "explanation": "Two complementary optimizations: 1) PUSH year filter (2000) into CTEs before aggregation to reduce data volume and avoid full table scans. 2) OR condition (ws_qty > 0 OR cs_qty > 0) split into UNION ALL with exclusion predicate to allow focused execution paths. Combined speedup ~6x from reduced scanning, smaller joins, and predicate specialization."
