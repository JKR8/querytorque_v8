  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: 1) Date CTE isolation to filter date_dim once for year=2000 and push down to all three fact tables, reducing fact table scans and join cardinality. 2) OR-to-UNION decomposition to split the OR condition on ws_qty/cs_qty into separate branches, allowing each branch to use more efficient join strategies. The second branch excludes rows already captured by the first branch (ws_qty>0) to prevent duplicates."
