  "explanation": "Applied two independent transforms: 1) date_cte_isolate to filter date_dim early and reduce join size, and customer_address prefetch to push down state/country filters; 2) or_to_union to break complex OR conditions into 3 separate UNION ALL branches, allowing better predicate pushdown and index usage. These transforms can be applied independently or combined."
