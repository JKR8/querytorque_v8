  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim and item filters into separate CTEs to reduce fact table cardinality early. The date_dim filter (d_date BETWEEN ...) reduces 73,049 rows to 61 rows (239.5x reduction), and item filter reduces 102,000 rows to 6,464 rows. By joining catalog_sales with these filtered dimensions first, we dramatically reduce the input to the expensive LEFT OUTER JOIN with catalog_returns and subsequent aggregation. This mimics the pattern from Date CTE Isolation example where pre-filtering dimensions reduces fact table rows before complex operations."
