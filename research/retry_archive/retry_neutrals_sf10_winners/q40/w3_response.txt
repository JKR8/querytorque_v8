  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter into a CTE (filtered_dates) to create a small pre-filtered dimension table (73,049 → 61 rows). This allows the optimizer to join this small CTE early with catalog_sales, dramatically reducing the intermediate join size before other operations. The main query joins with this CTE instead of the full date_dim table, preserving all semantics while reducing the data processed in subsequent joins."
