  "explanation": "Created two specialized date CTEs: filtered_dates_main for the main query's specific month/year, and filtered_dates_cross for the cross_items and avg_sales CTEs covering the broader year range. This isolates all date_dim filtering into CTEs, allowing each fact table join to use pre-filtered date dimension rows. The main query now joins store_sales/catalog_sales/web_sales directly with the filtered_dates_main CTE instead of scanning the full date_dim table multiple times. Similarly, cross_items and avg_sales use filtered_dates_cross, eliminating redundant full table scans of date_dim across all subqueries."
