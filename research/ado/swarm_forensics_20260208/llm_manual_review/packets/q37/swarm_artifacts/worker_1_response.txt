```

Changes: Created early-filtering CTEs for item, date_dim, and inventory to reduce data before the final join, and converted catalog_sales join to an EXISTS subquery to avoid unnecessary data multiplication.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by filtering dimension tables early and reducing the catalog_sales join overhead.
