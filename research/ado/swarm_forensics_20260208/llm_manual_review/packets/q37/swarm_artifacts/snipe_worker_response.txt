Changes: Isolated dimension filters (date, item) into CTEs early, pre-joined filtered inventory with dates, converted the main multi-table join into a sequence of semi-joins (EXISTS) that eliminate rows before expensive joins, and maintained all original filters exactly.

Expected speedup: 2.0x–2.5x by reducing join cardinality through early filtering and replacing full joins with semi-joins for existence checks.
