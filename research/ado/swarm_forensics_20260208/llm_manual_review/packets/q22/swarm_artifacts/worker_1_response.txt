```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11
)
SELECT
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category,
    AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM inventory
INNER JOIN filtered_dates ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk
INNER JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP (
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
)
ORDER BY
    qoh,
    i_product_name,
    i_brand,
    i_class,
    i_category
LIMIT 100;
```

```
Changes: Isolated date_dim filtering into a CTE to push the date range predicate down early, then explicitly joined the filtered dates to inventory and item.
Expected speedup: 2-4x by reducing the fact table join to only rows matching the 12-month date range, allowing DuckDB to build smaller hash tables for the joins.
