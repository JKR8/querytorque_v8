**Changes**: Transformed the zip code inequality into UNION ALL branches (ca_zip_prefix < s_zip_prefix and ca_zip_prefix > s_zip_prefix) to enable better join optimization. Pre-materialized date-filtered sales with item joins, customer zip prefixes, and store zip prefixes to avoid recomputation.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x. The UNION ALL decomposition allows the optimizer to use different access paths for each inequality branch, while early filtering and CTE materialization reduce the working set size for the expensive cross-table zip comparison.
