WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering and predicate pushdown to dimension tables before joining with the fact table, and materialize intermediate results to reduce redundant scans.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate dimension table filters (time, household, store) into separate CTEs to enable independent optimization and reduce fact table join cardinality.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in staged CTEs, then consolidate aggregations into a single pass while sharing filtered dimension sets.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform query structure by converting implicit OR conditions to UNION ALL, rewriting INTERSECT patterns as EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.
