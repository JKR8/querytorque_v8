Changes: Isolated dimension table filters into CTEs to create small hash tables before joining with the large fact table.
Expected speedup: 2.0x-3.0x
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Created filtered CTEs** for each dimension table (`time_dim`, `household_demographics`, `store`) with their respective filters applied early. This reduces each dimension to only the rows needed for the join.
2. **Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax** for better optimizer control.
3. **Maintained semantic equivalence**: All original filters and joins are preserved exactly.
4. **Preserved output columns**: The query still returns exactly `COUNT(*)` with the same ORDER BY and LIMIT.
5. **CTE column completeness**: Each CTE includes the join key needed by downstream joins (`t_time_sk`, `hd_demo_sk`, `s_store_sk`).

This approach follows the "dimension_cte_isolate" pattern from the reference examples, which showed success in prior optimizations. By materializing small filtered dimension sets first, the subsequent joins with the large `store_sales` fact table can use efficient hash joins with minimal probing overhead.
