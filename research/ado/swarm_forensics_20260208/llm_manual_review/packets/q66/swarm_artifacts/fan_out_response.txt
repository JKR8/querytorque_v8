WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_and_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into CTEs, filter dimension tables early, and materialize repeated patterns to reduce intermediate data size.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, ship_mode, time) into reusable CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and shared scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with multiple CTEs to prefetch and pre-join filtered dimensions, and consolidate monthly aggregates into a single scan per fact table for efficiency.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural changes: transform OR conditions to UNION ALL, apply EXISTS-based rewrites, and decorrelate patterns to improve join planning and parallelization.
