WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_basic_optimizations
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables before joining with facts, push predicates into CTE definitions, and materialize repeated CTEs to avoid recomputation across queries.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining, extract shared dimension constraints (like market_id), and isolate date-like filters even though none exist—apply similarly to customer/customer_address.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_restructure_with_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs, prefetch multiple dimension filters into a single CTE, and consolidate the two color queries into one pass with conditional aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Convert OR conditions (like birth_country <> country) into UNION ALL branches, transform HAVING subqueries to decorrelated joins, and re-express set operations as EXISTS patterns if they appear.
