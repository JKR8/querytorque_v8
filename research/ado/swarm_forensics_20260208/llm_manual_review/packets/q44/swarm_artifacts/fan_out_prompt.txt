You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## DAG Structure & Bottlenecks

| Node | Role | Cost % | Key Operations |
|------|------|-------:|----------------|
| main_query |  | 0.0% | — |

## Top 5 FAISS Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **intersect_to_exists** (1.83xx) — Convert INTERSECT subquery pattern to multiple EXISTS clauses for better join planning
2. **date_cte_isolate** (4.00xx) — Extract date filtering into a separate CTE to enable predicate pushdown and reduce scans
3. **deferred_window_aggregation** (1.36xx) — When multiple CTEs each perform GROUP BY + WINDOW (cumulative sum), then are joined with FULL OUTER JOIN followed by ano
4. **pushdown** (2.11xx) — Push filters from outer query into CTEs/subqueries to reduce intermediate result sizes
5. **single_pass_aggregation** (4.47xx) — Consolidate multiple subqueries scanning the same table into a single CTE with conditional aggregates

## All Available Examples (full catalog — can swap if needed)

- **composite_decorrelate_union** (2.42xx) — Decorrelate multiple correlated EXISTS subqueries into pre-materialized DISTINCT
- **date_cte_isolate** (4.00xx) — Extract date filtering into a separate CTE to enable predicate pushdown and redu
- **decorrelate** (2.92xx) — Convert correlated subquery to separate CTE with GROUP BY, then JOIN
- **deferred_window_aggregation** (1.36xx) — When multiple CTEs each perform GROUP BY + WINDOW (cumulative sum), then are joi
- **dimension_cte_isolate** (1.93xx) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables into CTEs before joining with fact table, not ju
- **early_filter** (4.00xx) — Filter dimension tables FIRST, then join to fact tables to reduce expensive join
- **intersect_to_exists** (1.83xx) — Convert INTERSECT subquery pattern to multiple EXISTS clauses for better join pl
- **materialize_cte** (1.37xx) — Extract repeated subquery patterns into a CTE to avoid recomputation
- **multi_date_range_cte** (2.35xx) — When query uses multiple date_dim aliases with different filters (d1, d2, d3), c
- **multi_dimension_prefetch** (2.71xx) — Pre-filter multiple dimension tables (date + store) into separate CTEs before jo
- **or_to_union** (3.17xx) — Split OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches for better inde
- **prefetch_fact_join** (3.77xx) — Pre-filter dimension table into CTE, then pre-join with fact table in second CTE
- **pushdown** (2.11xx) — Push filters from outer query into CTEs/subqueries to reduce intermediate result
- **shared_dimension_multi_channel** (1.30xx) — Extract shared dimension filters (date, item, promotion) into CTEs when multiple
- **single_pass_aggregation** (4.47xx) — Consolidate multiple subqueries scanning the same table into a single CTE with c
- **union_cte_split** (1.36xx) — Split a generic UNION ALL CTE into specialized CTEs when the main query filters 

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep FAISS recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from FAISS picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
