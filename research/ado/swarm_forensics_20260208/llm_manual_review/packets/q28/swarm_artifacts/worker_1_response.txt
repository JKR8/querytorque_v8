Changes: Consolidated six separate table scans into a single filtered scan with conditional bucket assignment, then performed grouping and pivoting in two CTEs. This reduces I/O by reading the fact table once and applies all filters early.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from eliminating redundant scans and early filtering.
