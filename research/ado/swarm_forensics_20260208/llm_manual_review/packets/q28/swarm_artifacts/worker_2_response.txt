**Changes**: Restructured six independent table scans into a single scan with bucket assignment, followed by grouped aggregation and pivoting. This reduces full table scans from six to one while preserving exact semantics.

**Expected speedup**: ~4–6x due to eliminating redundant I/O and enabling single-pass aggregation.
