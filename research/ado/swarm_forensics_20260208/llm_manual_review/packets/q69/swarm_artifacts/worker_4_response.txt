Changes: Introduced a CTE for the date range filter and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This consolidates the repeated date filter logic into a single CTE while preserving the original EXISTS/NOT EXISTS structure, allowing the optimizer to better push filters and potentially reuse the date dimension scan.

Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x (moderate improvement from eliminating redundant date filter computations and giving the optimizer better join-order freedom)
