## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Table "web_returns" does not have a column named "wr_web_site_sk"

Candidate bindings: : "wr_item_sk"

LINE 81:       COALESCE(web_sales.ws_web_site_sk, web_returns.wr_web_site_sk) AS wsr_web_site_sk,

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering and predicate pushdown aggressively in CTEs to reduce data volume, and materialize reusable date filters.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
