WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early, materialize repeated date subqueries, and reduce intermediate result sizes through dimension-first filtering.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: shared_dimension_multi_channel, date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Extract shared date-week logic into reusable CTEs, pre-filter all dimension tables, and isolate date filtering to enable predicate pushdown across channel CTEs.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs, consider merging the three channel CTEs into one conditional-aggregation pass over a union of sales tables.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the subquery structure—decorrelate date subqueries, convert implicit joins to explicit exists patterns, and restructure for better join planning.
