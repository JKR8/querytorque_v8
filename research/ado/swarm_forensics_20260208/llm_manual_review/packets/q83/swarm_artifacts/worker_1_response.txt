**Changes:** Materialized the repeated date subquery into a CTE (`filtered_dates`), then used explicit joins to push this filter early into each channel's CTE. This avoids redundant computation of the date filter and reduces the joined date_dim rows before aggregating.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.5-2x due to eliminating repeated subquery execution and early filtering of date_dim.
