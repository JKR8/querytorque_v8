**Changes**: Created a single-pass aggregation by first extracting relevant date_sk values into a CTE, then UNIONing all three fact tables filtered by these dates, and finally computing all channel aggregates in one GROUP BY with conditional sums.

**Expected speedup**: ~3-4x by reducing three separate fact table scans to one combined scan, eliminating redundant item joins, and enabling vectorized aggregation across all channels simultaneously.
