## Optimization Strategy: moderate_dimension_isolation

**Your approach**: Isolate each filtered dimension (date_dim, item) into separate CTEs, then join with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_3_w2

```sql
SELECT
  dt.d_year,
  item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
  item.i_brand AS brand,
  SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM date_dim AS dt, store_sales, item
WHERE
  dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
  AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  AND item.i_manufact_id = 816
  AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY
  dt.d_year,
  item.i_brand,
  item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
  dt.d_year,
  sum_agg DESC,
  brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Join date, store sales, and item; filter to November and manufacturer 816; aggregate revenue by year and brand; then return the ordered top rows.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [d_year, brand_id, brand, sum_agg] — ordered by dt.d_year ASC, sum_agg DESC, brand_id ASC
**Dependencies**: date_dim AS dt (join), store_sales (join), item (join)
**Joins**: dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk | store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
**Filters**: item.i_manufact_id = 816 | dt.d_moy = 11
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  dt.d_year,
  item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
  item.i_brand AS brand,
  SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM date_dim AS dt, store_sales, item
WHERE
  dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
  AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
  AND item.i_manufact_id = 816
  AND dt.d_moy = 11
GROUP BY
  dt.d_year,
  item.i_brand,
  item.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
  dt.d_year,
  sum_agg DESC,
  brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Tuesday') then ss_sales_price else  null end) tue_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_day_name FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_store_id FROM store WHERE s_gmt_offset = -5
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 3. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
     i_item_id
    ,i_item_desc
    ,s_store_id
    ,s_store_name
    ,avg(ss_quantity)        as store_sales_quantity
    ,avg(sr_return_quantity) as store_returns_quantity
    ,avg(cs_quantity)        as catalog_sales_quantity
 from
    store_sales
   ,store_returns
   ,catalog_sales
   ,date_dim             d1
   ,date_dim             d2
   ,date_dim             d3
   ,store
   ,item
 where
     d1.d_moy               = 4 
 and d1.d_year              = 1999
 and d1.d_date_sk           = ss_sold_date_sk
 and i_item_sk              = ss_item_sk
 and s_store_sk             = ss_store_sk
 and ss_customer_sk         = sr_customer_sk
 and ss_item_sk             = sr_item_sk
 and ss_ticket_number       = sr_ticket_number
 and sr_returned_date_sk    = d2.d_date_sk
 and d2.d_moy               between 4 and  4 + 3 
 and d2.d_year              = 1999
 and sr_customer_sk         = cs_bill_customer_sk
 and sr_item_sk             = cs_item_sk
 and cs_sold_date_sk        = d3.d_date_sk     
 and d3.d_year              in (1999,1999+1,1999+2)
 group by
    i_item_id
   ,i_item_desc
   ,s_store_id
   ,s_store_name
 order by
    i_item_id 
   ,i_item_desc
   ,s_store_id
   ,s_store_name
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy = 9 AND d_year = 1999

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: date_cte_isolate on q25 (0.5xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not pre-filter and materialize fact tables when the query has 3+ fact table joins. The optimizer needs freedom to reorder multi-way fact joins and push filters across them.
**Why it regressed:** Pre-filtered and joined store_sales to date CTE BEFORE the 3-way fact table join (store_sales <- store_returns <- catalog_sales). By materializing the date-filtered store_sales early, the optimizer loses the ability to push filters across the multi-way fact join and reorder joins optimally.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `d_year`
  2. `brand_id`
  3. `brand`
  4. `sum_agg`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
