**Changes**: Applied OR-to-UNION decomposition by splitting the OR condition into two mutually exclusive branches: (1) address qualifies (zip or state), and (2) high sales price where address doesn't already qualify. Created pre-filtered CTEs for date_dim and customer_address to reduce join sizes early.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.5-3.0x due to elimination of OR predicate evaluation during joins, early dimension filtering, and mutually exclusive UNION ALL branches that prevent duplicate row processing.
