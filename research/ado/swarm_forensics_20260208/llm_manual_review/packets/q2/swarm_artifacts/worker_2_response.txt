Changes: Created a pre-filtered date_dim CTE for only years 1998-1999, consolidated the wswscs aggregation into a single CTE that includes year, and restructured the main query to avoid recomputing the same weekly sales twice.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x due to reduced date_dim scan, single-pass aggregation for both years, and eliminated redundant joins.
