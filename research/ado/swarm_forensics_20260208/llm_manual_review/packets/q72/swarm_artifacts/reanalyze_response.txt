FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short due to fundamental structural flaws. Worker 1 only achieved 1.13x because it performed basic predicate pushdown but left the massive join between catalog_sales and inventory untouched - this remains the bottleneck. Worker 3's aggressive restructuring (0.41x) created overly complex CTEs that DuckDB couldn't optimize, generating worse execution plans. Workers 2 and 5 failed with syntax errors due to incorrect table references in CTE joins. The core issue is that all attempts treated this as a standard star-join query, missing the critical nature of the inequality join (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity) and the three-way date constraint (d1-d2-d3). DuckDB's optimizer struggles with these complex join conditions, especially the inequality that can't use hash joins efficiently.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Inequality join optimization**: None addressed the `inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity` inequality. This could be transformed using window functions or range joins.
2. **Date constraint fusion**: The d1-d2-d3 relationship (d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5) wasn't pre-computed as a single date filter.
3. **Early aggregation**: No attempt pushed aggregation before the expensive joins. The COUNT(*) and CASE aggregates could be computed earlier.
4. **Materialized join elimination**: The LEFT JOIN to catalog_returns is unused in SELECT/GROUP BY - it only affects counts through potential row multiplication. This could be analyzed for semantic equivalence.
5. **Physical optimization hints**: DuckDB supports PRAGMA and join order hints that weren't explored.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Combine aggressive date constraint fusion with early inequality filtering and strategic join ordering:
1. Create a fused date CTE that pre-joins d1-d2-d3 with all constraints
2. Filter catalog_sales early using the fused date CTE and demographic CTEs
3. Transform the inventory inequality join using a window approach: for each cs_item_sk, find inventory records with quantity < cs_quantity
4. Push aggregation before joining with warehouse/item where possible
5. Use DuckDB-specific join hints (e.g., ASOF join for inventory inequality) if available

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, early_filter, decorrelate
HINT: Focus on the inequality join between inventory and catalog_sales as the primary bottleneck. Pre-compute all date constraints in a single CTE, then use a window-based approach to handle the quantity comparison without a full cross join. Consider using DuckDB's ASOF join capabilities if available for the inventory inequality.
