WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters earliest possible, materializing filtered dimension tables first, and ensuring predicates propagate into subqueries before joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate all dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining to fact tables, enabling parallel filter optimization and reducing join cardinality early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact table in staged CTEs, then perform final aggregation; consolidate multiple dimension filters into single-pass CTEs.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform OR conditions on hd_buy_potential using UNION ALL, convert case-expression to filterable computed column, and consider decorrelation techniques for the grouping subquery.
