Changes: Created separate CTEs for filtered date_dim and store tables to push filters earlier and enable better join ordering. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: 1.2x-1.5x (moderate improvement from early reduction of dimension tables before joining with large fact table)
