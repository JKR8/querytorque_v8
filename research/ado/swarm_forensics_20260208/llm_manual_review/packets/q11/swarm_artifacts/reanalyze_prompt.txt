## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.09x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing year and sale_type filters deeper into CTEs, pre-filtering customer/date dimensions before joins, and materializing intermediate results to reduce repetitive computation.

```sql
WITH store_sales_agg AS (
  SELECT
    c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
    c_last_name AS customer_last_name,
    c_preferred_cust_flag AS customer_preferred_cust_flag,
    c_birth_country AS customer_birth_country,
    c_login AS customer_login,
    c_email_address AS customer_email_address,
    d_year AS dyear,
    SUM(ss_ext_list_price - ss_ext_discount_amt) AS year_total,
    's' AS sale_type
  FROM customer

```

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolate
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Extract date filtering (dyear=2001/2002) and customer dimension into separate CTEs before joining with sales tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and shared dimension reuse across store/web channels.

```sql
WITH date_filtered AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year IN (2001, 2002)
),
store_sales_agg AS (
  SELECT
    c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
    c_last_name AS customer_last_name,

    c_login AS customer_login,
    c_email_address AS customer_email_address,
    d_year AS dyear,
    SUM(ss_ext_list_price - ss_ext_discount_amt) AS year_total,

  FROM customer
  JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
  JOIN date_filtered ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  GROUP BY

    d_year
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.27x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Create separate CTEs for each date range (2001, 2002) and pre-join filtered dimensions with sales facts before aggregation, restructuring the multi-alias self-join into staged pre-aggregated results.

```sql
WITH 
-- Pre-filter date_dim for years 2001 and 2002
date_range AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year IN (2001, 2002)
),
-- Store sales for 2001
store_2001 AS (
    SELECT
        c.c_customer_id AS customer_id,
        c.c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
        c.c_last_name AS customer_last_name,
        c.c_birth_country AS customer_birth_country,
        SUM(ss_ext_list_price - ss_ext_discount_amt) AS year_total
    FROM customer c
    JOIN store_sales ss ON c.c_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk
    JOIN date_range d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_year = 2001
    GROUP BY
        c.c_customer_id,
        c.c_first_name,
        c.c_last_name,
        c.c_birth_country
),

store_2002 AS (
    SELECT
        c.c_customer_id AS customer_id,
        c.c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.45x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: union_cte_split, intersect_to_exists, or_to_union
- **Strategy hint**: Split the UNION ALL CTE into separate store/web CTEs, transform the four-way intersection pattern into EXISTS subqueries, and explore converting conditional ratios to UNION ALL branches for better join planning.

```sql
WITH year_total_store AS (
  SELECT
    c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
    c_last_name AS customer_last_name,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
