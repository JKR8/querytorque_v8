WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates down, and materializing the repeated date subquery into a CTE to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate
HINT: Isolate filtered dimensions into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, and decorrelate the item price subquery by pre-computing category averages.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with multi-step CTEs that pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with the fact table, and consolidate the item category average calculation into a single pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore non-conventional transformations such as rewriting subqueries with EXISTS patterns, splitting potential OR conditions on item categories, and applying advanced decorrelation techniques.
