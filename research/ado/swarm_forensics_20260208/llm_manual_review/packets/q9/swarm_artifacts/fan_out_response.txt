WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_single_pass
EXAMPLES: pushdown, single_pass_aggregation, materialize_cte
HINT: Consolidate the five independent store_sales scans into a single pass with conditional aggregates using CASE statements, then push filters and materialize the results to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_prefilter
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, early_filter, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter the reason table first into a CTE, then compute all bucket aggregates from store_sales in a separate CTE, ensuring dimension filtering happens early and shared across all calculations.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Create a pre-filtered fact CTE first, then compute all conditional aggregates from it, optimizing for fact table scan efficiency even though no join exists in the original query.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the CASE/WHEN logic into UNION ALL branches for each quantity range threshold condition, then use EXISTS-style logic to simulate the conditional aggregation behavior.
