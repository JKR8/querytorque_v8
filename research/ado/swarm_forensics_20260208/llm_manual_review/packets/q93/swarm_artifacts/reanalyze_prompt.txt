You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_93
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 93 in stream 0 using template query93.tpl
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.81x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Filter the `reason` table first to reduce join volume, push filters into CTE, and materialize filtered dimension data early to optimize the left join pattern.

```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT r_reason_sk
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
),
filtered_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        sr_item_sk,
        sr_ticket_number,
        sr_return_quantity
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN filtered_reason 
        ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
)
SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,
    SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (
    SELECT
        ss_customer_sk,
        CASE
            WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
            THEN (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
            ELSE (ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)
        END AS act_sales
    FROM store_sales
    LEFT OUTER JOIN filtered_returns
        ON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
        AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
) AS t
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Values list "t" does not have a column named "sr_reason_sk"

LINE 26:     WHERE t.sr_reason_sk = fr.r_reason_sk
                   ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate dimension table filtering (reason) into a dedicated CTE, then restructure the query to join this pre-filtered dimension with fact tables using explicit joins instead of cross joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT r_reason_sk
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
)
SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,
    SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (
    SELECT
        ss_customer_sk,
        CASE
            WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
            THEN (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
            ELSE (ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)
        END AS act_sales
    FROM store_sales
    LEFT OUTER JOIN store_returns
        ON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
        AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
        AND sr_reason_sk IN (SELECT r_reason_sk FROM filtered_reason)
) AS t
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM filtered_reason fr 
    WHERE t.sr_reason_sk = fr.r_reason_sk
    OR t.sr_reason_sk IS NULL
)
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.77x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter reason table, then pre-join with store_returns to create a filtered returns CTE before joining to store_sales in a single aggregation pass, eliminating cross join inefficiencies.

```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT r_reason_sk
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
),
filtered_returns AS (
    SELECT 
        sr_item_sk,
        sr_ticket_number,
        sr_return_quantity
    FROM store_returns
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 
        FROM filtered_reason 
        WHERE sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
    )
)
SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
            THEN (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
            ELSE (ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)
        END
    ) AS sumsales
FROM store_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN filtered_returns
    ON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
    AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.80x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the CASE logic and cross join into a UNION ALL structure separating returned vs non-returned sales, or explore decorrelation techniques to restructure the dimension join pattern.

```sql
WITH filtered_returns AS (
  SELECT 
    sr_item_sk,
    sr_ticket_number,
    sr_return_quantity
  FROM store_returns
  JOIN reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
  WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
)
SELECT
  ss_customer_sk,
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN fr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
      THEN (ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
      ELSE ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
    END
  ) AS sumsales
FROM store_sales
LEFT JOIN filtered_returns fr
  ON ss_item_sk = fr.sr_item_sk
  AND ss_ticket_number = fr.sr_ticket_number
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (0.80x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT r_reason_sk
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
), filtered_returns AS (
    SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
)
SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
            THEN (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
            ELSE ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
        END
    ) AS sumsales
FROM store_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN filtered_returns ON (
    sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
    AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
)
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk
LIMIT 100

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
