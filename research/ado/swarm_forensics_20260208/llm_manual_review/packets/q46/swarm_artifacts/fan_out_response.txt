WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_dimension_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe dimension filtering first to reduce join volume, push filters into subqueries, and materialize repetitive patterns for clarity and potential reuse.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate all filtered dimension tables (date, store, household_demographics, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining with fact table to enable parallel filtering and predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions in a coordinated pipeline, then join with fact table in a single optimized pass to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, decorrelate, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL, restructure the self-join pattern using decorrelation techniques, and consider alternative join formulations for better plan selection.
