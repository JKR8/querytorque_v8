  "explanation": "Applied dimension filtering early using CTEs (date_cte_isolate + early_filter transforms). This pushes selective filters down to dimension tables before joining with the large fact table (catalog_sales). Specifically: 1) Created filtered_dates CTE for d_year=1998, 2) filtered_item for i_category='Jewelry', 3) filtered_customer_demographics for gender/education, 4) filtered_customer for birth_month, 5) filtered_customer_address for state filter. This reduces the fact table join cardinality significantly while preserving all literal values exactly."
