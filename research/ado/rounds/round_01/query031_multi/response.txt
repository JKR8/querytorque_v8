  "explanation": "Added a date_dim_cte that isolates the date filter (d_year=1998, d_qoy in 1,2,3) and is reused by both ss and ws CTEs. This prevents repeated scanning of date_dim and pushes the date filter down to the earliest possible point, reducing the fact table join size before aggregation. All literals are preserved exactly as in the original query."
