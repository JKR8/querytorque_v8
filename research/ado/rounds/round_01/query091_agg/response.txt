  "explanation": "Applied three optimization strategies: 1) Date CTE isolation to filter date_dim early, 2) OR-to-UNION to split the OR condition into two separate access patterns (only 2 branches, within OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT), and 3) Early filtering by creating CTEs for each dimension table with filters applied before the main join. All literal values are preserved exactly as in the original query."
