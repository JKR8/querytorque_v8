  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into CTE to reduce rows before joining with store_sales. Created item filter CTE to pre-filter items by manager_id. This transforms the 3-way join into a sequence of smaller joins, allowing the database to apply filters early and reduce the volume of data processed in the main join."
