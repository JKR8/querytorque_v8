  "explanation": "Pushed year filters (1999, 1998) from main query into the all_sales CTE via a filtered_dates CTE. This reduces the amount of data aggregated in all_sales by filtering date_dim early and avoiding computing sales for irrelevant years. The main query now joins two pre-filtered CTE instances instead of scanning the full aggregated data and filtering after the join."
