  "explanation": "The original query has two independent OR groups: one for customer_demographics (3 conditions) and one for customer_address (3 conditions), creating 9 possible combinations. By transforming to UNION ALL with 9 separate branches, each branch can use focused indexes on specific marital_status/education_status combinations and specific state lists. Date filter is extracted into a CTE and joined once per branch. This eliminates the complex OR evaluation in the join conditions, allowing each branch to be optimized independently."
