  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim, customer_demographics, and store filters into separate CTEs to push filters early and reduce the store_sales scan from 34M rows. The filtered_sales CTE reduces to only rows matching date, customer demographics, and store filters before joining with item, enabling early reduction of the largest table. This follows QT-OPT-003 pattern."
