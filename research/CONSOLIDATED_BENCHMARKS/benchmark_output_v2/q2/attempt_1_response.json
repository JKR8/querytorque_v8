  "explanation": "Pushed year filters (d_year = 1998 and d_year = 1999) into the wswscs CTEs before aggregation, creating two separate CTEs wswscs_1998 and wswscs_1999. This eliminates the need to scan the entire wswscs result (264 rows) and join with date_dim again in the main query, reducing the data volume early. The wscs CTE remains unchanged as it's the base union. The main query now directly joins the two pre-filtered, pre-aggregated CTEs."
