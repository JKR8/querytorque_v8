  "explanation": "Applied three complementary rewrites: 1) OR-to-UNION splits the OR condition into separate branches for zip and item filters, avoiding expensive OR evaluation. 2) Date CTE isolation extracts date_dim filtering into a CTE to reduce join size early. 3) Subquery flattening precomputes the item list, converting a correlated IN subquery to a simple join. These can be combined for multiplicative speedup."
