Looking at this query, I can see a clear optimization opportunity: **two identical subqueries with only one differing condition** (the time hour range). This is a perfect candidate for materializing the common parts.

        "main_query": "SELECT CAST(amc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(pmc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS am_pm_ratio FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS amc FROM qualified_sales WHERE t_hour BETWEEN 10 AND 11) AS at_tbl, (SELECT COUNT(*) AS pmc FROM qualified_sales WHERE t_hour BETWEEN 16 AND 17) AS pt ORDER BY am_pm_ratio LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",

      ],

      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The original query performs two nearly identical subqueries that join the same four tables with the same three filter conditions (hd_dep_count=2, wp_char_count range, and hour range). The only difference is the hour range condition (10-11 vs 16-17). By extracting the common join and filter conditions into a CTE (qualified_sales), we compute the expensive join operation once instead of twice. This reduces I/O and computation by avoiding duplicate table scans and joins. The final query then simply filters the pre-joined, pre-filtered CTE by the differing hour conditions."
}
```

**Key insight**: The query computes counts for two different hour ranges but otherwise joins the same 4 tables with the same 3 filter conditions. Materializing the common join result eliminates duplicate work.
