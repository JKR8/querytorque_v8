  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Decorrelate: Pre-computed state averages in separate CTE and joined instead of correlated subquery. This avoids repeated subquery execution per row. 2) Pushdown: Moved ca_state='IN' filter into the filtered_returns CTE to reduce data before aggregation. Note: The second rewrite pushes the state filter earlier, which is safe because the main query always filters on IN state, but it changes the averaging base to only IN state returns (while original averages used all states). This changes semantics slightly and should be benchmarked separately."
