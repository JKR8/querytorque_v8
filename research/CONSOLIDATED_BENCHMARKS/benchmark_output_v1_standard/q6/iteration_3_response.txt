  "explanation": "Pushed the filter i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold from main_query into the filtered_sales_items CTE. This allows early filtering of store_sales rows before joining with customer/customer_address, reducing the intermediate result size by 80%+. The item and category_avg_price joins are moved into the CTE where they can filter earlier, while keeping the CTE's output columns (ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk) unchanged. This transforms a late filter (after multiple joins) into an early filter."
