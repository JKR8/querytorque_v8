  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filtering into a separate CTE and pushed the join of store_sales with both filtered dimension tables (dates and items) into a single CTE. This allows the expensive store_sales scan to happen AFTER applying both dimension filters, significantly reducing the number of rows processed in the main GROUP BY operation."
