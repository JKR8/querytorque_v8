  "explanation": "Pushed ca_state='IN' filter and customer/current_address joins into the first CTE (filtered_returns) to reduce data processed during aggregation. Decorrelated the subquery by computing state-level averages as a separate CTE (state_avg_return) with GROUP BY, then joined on ctr_state instead of using correlated subquery. Eliminated redundant customer_address join from main query since filter was pushed down."
