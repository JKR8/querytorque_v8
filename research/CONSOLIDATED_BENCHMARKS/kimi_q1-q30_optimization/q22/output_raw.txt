  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to push the predicate d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11 down to the date_dim dimension table before joining with the large inventory fact table. This reduces the join input size by filtering to only 12 months of date keys first, minimizing I/O and hash join costs on inventory."
