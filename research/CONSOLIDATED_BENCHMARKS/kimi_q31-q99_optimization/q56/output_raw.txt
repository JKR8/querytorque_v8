  "explanation": "Eliminated IN subquery by materializing filtered_items CTE, pushing the i_color filter down to the base table. Replaced subquery with explicit join to filtered_items, enabling the optimizer to scan the item table once and reuse results across ss and cs. This avoids executing the subquery multiple times and allows better join ordering."
