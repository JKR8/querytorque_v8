  "explanation": "Pushed GROUP BY and aggregations (COUNT, SUM) down into each UNION branch. Since channel and col_name are constants per branch, aggregating within each branch first reduces data volume before the UNION ALL, eliminating the need for the outer GROUP BY. Each branch now computes partial aggregates on (d_year, d_qoy, i_category) locally."
