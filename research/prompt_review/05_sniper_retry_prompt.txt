## PREVIOUS SNIPER ATTEMPT (iter 1) — Learn from this

Your first attempt achieved **1.45x** against a target of **2.0x**.

### What went wrong and what to change:
The nested-loop between catalog_sales and inventory is the bottleneck (170K × 11M probes). W1's date CTE gives 1.15x but doesn't touch this join. Pre-filter inventory by d_week_seq range to reduce from 11M to ~1.5M rows. Keep W1's date isolation. Use CASE WHEN, not FILTER. Preserve LEFT JOINs. Do NOT attempt decorrelation (W2 broke equivalence).

You are a senior SQL optimization architect for PostgreSQL v14.3. You have FULL FREEDOM to design your own approach — you are NOT constrained to any specific DAG topology or CTE structure. The analyst's strategy guidance below is ADVISORY, not mandatory.

Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — guards prevent silent breakage. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from output.

## Target: >=2.0x speedup

Your target is >=2.0x speedup on this query. This is the bar. Anything below 2.0x is a miss.

```

## Failure Synthesis (from diagnostic analyst)

W1 achieved 1.15x via date CTE isolation — the only passing approach. The bottleneck is the nested-loop join between filtered catalog_sales and inventory (non-equi condition inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity). W2 broke semantic equivalence by decorrelating a non-correlated subquery path. W3 used PG-unsupported FILTER syntax. W4's novel approach didn't reduce the critical join input cardinality.

## Unexplored Angles

No worker attempted to pre-aggregate or pre-filter inventory. The EXPLAIN shows inventory is scanned fully (11M rows) for each probe. Pre-filtering inventory by the d_week_seq range (only ~7 weeks in 1998) would reduce the join input from 11M to ~1.5M rows.

## Strategy Guidance (ADVISORY — not mandatory)

1. Keep W1's date CTE isolation (proven 1.15x). 2. Add inventory pre-filtering: join inventory with the same date CTE to restrict to relevant weeks, reducing from 11M to ~1.5M rows. 3. Then join filtered_cs with filtered_inventory on (item_sk, quantity < condition). This reduces the nested-loop from 170K×11M to 170K×1.5M — a ~7x reduction in join work.

## Example Adaptation Notes

pg_date_cte_explicit_join: APPLY the date CTE isolation pattern (proven by W1). IGNORE the explicit join conversion — PG already uses explicit joins.
pg_dimension_prefetch_star: APPLY the multi-dimension prefetch concept, adapted for INVENTORY pre-filtering. IGNORE the star-join aspect — Q072 is not a star join.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

  ,cc_name

        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name

```

```
[main_query]:

FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 AND sm_type = 'REGULAR' AND cc_class = 'small' AND w_gmt_offset = -5 GROUP BY SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

## Hazard Flags

- Do NOT attempt FILTER clause syntax — PG 14.3 supports it but W3's error suggests a syntax context issue. Use CASE WHEN instead.
- The non-equi join (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity) CANNOT be converted to hash join. Keep as nested-loop but reduce input cardinality.
- Preserve LEFT JOINs to promotion and catalog_returns.

## Engine Profile

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)
- **BITMAP_OR_SCAN**: Multi-branch OR conditions on indexed columns are handled via BitmapOr — a single fact table scan with bitmap combination. Extremely efficient.
- **SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination. Stops scanning after the first match per outer row.
- **INNER_JOIN_REORDERING**: PostgreSQL freely reorders INNER JOINs based on estimated selectivity. The cost model works well for explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
- **INDEX_ONLY_SCAN**: When an index covers all requested columns, PostgreSQL reads only the index without touching the heap.
- **PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION**: PostgreSQL parallelizes large scans and aggregations across worker processes with partial aggregation finalization.
- **JIT_COMPILATION**: PostgreSQL JIT-compiles complex expressions and tuple deforming for long-running queries.

### Optimizer Gaps (opportunities)
- **COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS**: Implicit comma-separated FROM tables (FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.id = t2.id) are treated as cross products initially. The cost model is significantly weaker on comma-joins than on explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  Opportunity: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. This alone can unlock 2-3x improvements. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
    + Q080: 3.32x — comma-joins to explicit JOINs + date CTE on multi-channel UNION query
    + Q099: 2.28x — same pattern on star schema
    + Q054: 1.14x — JOIN conversion alone
- **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS**: Cannot automatically decorrelate complex correlated subqueries. Correlated scalar subqueries with aggregates are executed as nested-loop with repeated evaluation.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
    + Q092: 4428x — timeout recovery. Unbounded correlated subquery converted to explicit JOIN.
    + Q032: 391x — same pattern, timeout to sub-second.
- **NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS**: Cannot pre-filter fact tables before non-equi join operations (date arithmetic, range comparisons, quantity < quantity). Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which is O(N*M).
  Opportunity: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
    + Q072: 2.68x — pre-filtered catalog_sales by wholesale_cost range before non-equi quantity comparison with inventory. Reduced nested-loop input by ~70%.
- **CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE**: PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default (multi-referenced) or by choice (AS MATERIALIZED). This creates a hard optimization fence — no predicate pushdown from outer query into CTE. This makes CTE-based strategies a double-edged sword on PG.
  Opportunity: Use materialization STRATEGICALLY: materialize when the CTE is expensive and reused multiple times. Avoid CTEs that fence off predicate pushdown for single-use cases.
    + Q065: 1.95x — strategic materialization prevented redundant fact table scan multiplication
- **CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS**: Same gap as DuckDB but WORSE on PostgreSQL because CTE materialization fence makes it more impactful. Predicates in the outer WHERE cannot propagate into materialized CTEs.
  Opportunity: Same as DuckDB: pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious — only when the CTE is clearly suboptimal.
    + Q080: 3.32x — date filter + comma-join conversion (the combo is key)
    + Q099: 2.28x — date CTE with explicit JOIN

## Correctness Invariants (HARD STOPS — non-negotiable)

These 4 constraints are absolute. Even with full creative freedom, you may NEVER violate these:

- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.
- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

## Aggregation Semantics Check (HARD STOP)

- STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — changing group membership changes the result.
- AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe.
- FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
- Verify aggregation equivalence for ANY proposed restructuring.

- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `set_local` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Verify output schema matches the Column Completeness Contract (same columns, same names, same order).
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Correctness Invariants` (including join/null behavior).
- Verify aggregation equivalence: same rows participate in each group, same aggregate semantics.
- Preserve all literals exactly (numbers, strings, date values).
- Apply `Hazard Flags` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Return a JSON object with your rewrite as `rewrite_sets`. Each node is a CTE
or the final SELECT. You MUST declare the output columns for every node in
`node_contracts` — this forces you to reason about what flows between CTEs.

Only include nodes you **changed or added**. Unchanged nodes are auto-filled
from the original query.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` node MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_desc`
  2. `w_warehouse_name`
  3. `d_week_seq`
  4. `no_promo`
  5. `promo`
  6. `total_cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [{
    "id": "rs_01",
    "transform": "<transform_name>",
    "nodes": {
      "<cte_name>": "<SQL for this CTE body>",
      "main_query": "<final SELECT>"
    },
    "node_contracts": {
      "<cte_name>": ["col1", "col2", "..."],
      "main_query": ["col1", "col2", "..."]
    },
    "set_local": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'", "SET LOCAL jit = 'off'"],
    "data_flow": "<cte_a> -> <cte_b> -> main_query",
    "invariants_kept": ["same output columns", "same rows"],
    "expected_speedup": "2.0x",
    "risk": "low"
  }]
}
```

### Rules
- Every node in `nodes` MUST appear in `node_contracts` and vice versa
- `node_contracts`: list the output column names each node produces
- `data_flow`: show the CTE dependency chain (forces you to think about order)
- `main_query` = the final SELECT — its contract must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- New CTE structures are encouraged — design the best topology for the query

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewrite as JSON:
