You are a senior query optimization architect. Your job is to deeply analyze a SQL query and produce a structured briefing for 4 specialist workers who will each write a different optimized version.

You are the ONLY call that sees all the data: EXPLAIN plans, DAG costs, full constraint list, global knowledge, and the complete example catalog. The workers will only see what YOU put in their briefings. Your output quality directly determines their success.

**NOTE:** The EXPLAIN plan shows the PHYSICAL execution structure, which may differ significantly from the LOGICAL DAG below. The optimizer may have already split CTEs, reordered joins, or pushed predicates. When the EXPLAIN and DAG disagree, the EXPLAIN is ground truth for what the optimizer is already doing.

This is a plan-only EXPLAIN (no ANALYZE). Row counts and costs are planner predictions — use them directionally but flag your diagnosis as lower-confidence. Fall back to schema-based reasoning (table sizes, index selectivity, join fan-out) to validate planner estimates.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~142 rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt]
**Dependencies**: catalog_sales, inventory, warehouse, item, customer_demographics, household_demographics, date_dim, date_dim, date_dim, promotion, catalog_returns
**Operators**: Nested Loop, Hash Join, Index Scan, Seq Scan, Sort, GroupAggregate
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq, SUM(CASE WHEN p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo, SUM(CASE WHEN NOT p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo, COUNT(*) AS total_cnt FROM catalog_sales JOIN inventory ON (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk) JOIN warehouse ON (w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk) JOIN item ON (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk) JOIN customer_demographics ON (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk) JOIN household_demographics ON (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk) JOIN date_dim ...
```


## Aggregation Semantics Check

You MUST verify aggregation equivalence for any proposed restructuring:

- **STDDEV_SAMP(x)** requires >=2 non-NULL values per group. Returns NULL for 0-1 values. Changing group membership changes the result.
- `STDDEV_SAMP(x) FILTER (WHERE year=1999)` over a combined (1999,2000) group is NOT equivalent to `STDDEV_SAMP(x)` over only 1999 rows — FILTER still uses the combined group's membership for the stddev denominator.
- **AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe**: if a join introduces row duplication, the aggregate result changes.
- When splitting a UNION ALL CTE with GROUP BY + aggregate, each split branch must preserve the exact GROUP BY columns and filter to the exact same row set as the original.
- **SAFE ALTERNATIVE**: If GROUP BY includes the discriminator column (e.g., d_year), each group is already partitioned. STDDEV_SAMP computed per-group is correct. You can then pivot using `MAX(CASE WHEN year = 1999 THEN year_total END) AS year_total_1999` because the GROUP BY guarantees exactly one row per (customer, year) — the MAX is just a row selector, not a real aggregation.

## Top 6 Tag-Matched Examples

### pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)
**Description:** Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. The combination is key on PostgreSQL - the CTE alone can hurt, but CTE + explicit JOINs together enable better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.
**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

### pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)
**Description:** On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) into CTEs and convert to explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates and join ordering from explicit JOINs with pre-materialized small dimension results.
**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)
**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescuex)
**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

### pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)
**Description:** Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax. On queries with expensive non-equi joins (inventory quantity < sales quantity, week_seq correlation), reducing both dimension AND fact table sizes before the join dramatically cuts the search space. The MATERIALIZED keyword on PG12+ forces early execution of each CTE.
**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

### pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)
**Description:** Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both per-item and per-store averages from the same materialized result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.
**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

## Engine Profile: Field Intelligence Briefing

*This is field intelligence gathered from 53 DSB queries at SF5-SF10. PostgreSQL is a fundamentally different optimizer than DuckDB — it has bitmap index scans, JIT compilation, and aggressive CTE materialization. Techniques that work on DuckDB often regress here. Use this to guide your analysis but apply your own judgment — every query is different. Add to this knowledge if you observe something new.*

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)

- **BITMAP_OR_SCAN**: Multi-branch OR conditions on indexed columns are handled via BitmapOr — a single fact table scan with bitmap combination. Extremely efficient.
  *Field note:* NEVER split OR conditions into UNION ALL branches on PostgreSQL. BitmapOr is categorically faster. We saw 0.21x on Q085 and 0.26x on Q091 — each UNION branch forced a full 7-table join + fact scan that BitmapOr avoids. The only conceivable case for OR-to-UNION on PG is when branches reference completely different tables, and even then it's risky.
- **SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination. Stops scanning after the first match per outer row.
  *Field note:* NEVER convert EXISTS to IN/NOT IN or to materialized CTEs with SELECT DISTINCT. The semi-join stops after first match — materializing forces a full DISTINCT scan of million-row fact tables. We saw 0.50x on Q069 (3 DISTINCT CTEs vs 3 semi-joins) and 0.86x on Q010 (UNION ALL CTE without dedup vs OR'd EXISTS short-circuits). Also: NOT IN has NULL-handling semantics that can block hash anti-join optimization.
- **INNER_JOIN_REORDERING**: PostgreSQL freely reorders INNER JOINs based on estimated selectivity. The cost model works well for explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  *Field note:* Don't restructure INNER JOIN orders — the optimizer handles this well. Focus on queries where JOIN type (LEFT) prevents reordering, or where comma-joins confuse the cost model (see COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS gap).
- **INDEX_ONLY_SCAN**: When an index covers all requested columns, PostgreSQL reads only the index without touching the heap.
  *Field note:* Dimension table lookups are already fast via index-only scans. Pre-filtering small dimensions (<10K rows) into CTEs adds materialization overhead with minimal benefit.
- **PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION**: PostgreSQL parallelizes large scans and aggregations across worker processes with partial aggregation finalization.
  *Field note:* Large fact table scans are already parallelized. Restructuring into CTEs may reduce parallelism opportunities because CTE materialization is single-threaded.
- **JIT_COMPILATION**: PostgreSQL JIT-compiles complex expressions and tuple deforming for long-running queries.
  *Field note:* Complex WHERE expressions have low per-row overhead due to JIT. Simplifying expressions for performance is usually unnecessary.

### Optimizer Gaps (hunt for these)

**COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS** [HIGH]
  What: Implicit comma-separated FROM tables (FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.id = t2.id) are treated as cross products initially. The cost model is significantly weaker on comma-joins than on explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  Why: The planner's join search space is less constrained with comma-joins. Explicit JOINs provide structural hints that help the optimizer find better plans faster, especially for 5+ table joins.
  Opportunity: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. This alone can unlock 2-3x improvements. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
  What worked:
    + Q080: 3.32x — comma-joins to explicit JOINs + date CTE on multi-channel UNION query
    + Q099: 2.28x — same pattern on star schema
    + Q054: 1.14x — JOIN conversion alone
  Field notes:
    * Look for FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE ... syntax. 5+ comma-separated tables is the sweet spot.
    * EXPLAIN will show unexpected join orders or high-cost nested loops when comma-joins confuse the cost model.
    * The win usually comes from explicit JOINs + CTE together, not CTE alone. date_cte_isolate without JOIN conversion is often neutral or harmful.
    * This is our most reliable PG optimization — convert the implicit syntax and the optimizer rewards you.
    * Validate at target scale — SF5 wins don't predict SF10 on PG (Q027 went from 9.62x to 0.97x).

**CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS** [HIGH]
  What: Cannot automatically decorrelate complex correlated subqueries. Correlated scalar subqueries with aggregates are executed as nested-loop with repeated evaluation.
  Why: Same limitation as DuckDB — correlation requires recognizing GROUP BY + JOIN equivalence. PostgreSQL does basic decorrelation for simple IN/EXISTS but fails on complex aggregate correlations.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
  What worked:
    + Q092: 4428x — timeout recovery. Unbounded correlated subquery converted to explicit JOIN.
    + Q032: 391x — same pattern, timeout to sub-second.
  Field notes:
    * Look for WHERE col > (SELECT AGG FROM ... WHERE outer.key = inner.key) patterns.
    * EXPLAIN will show SubPlan or nested-loop with repeated subquery execution if the optimizer failed to decorrelate.
    * These are often the queries that time out — if a DSB query runs >10s, check for correlated scalar subqueries first.
    * Simple IN/EXISTS correlation is already handled by PG's semi-join optimization — only complex aggregate correlations need manual decorrelation.
    * CRITICAL: when decorrelating, preserve ALL filters from the original subquery in the new CTE.
    * Validate at target scale — decorrelation wins are usually robust across scales, but verify on SF10.

**NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS** [HIGH]
  What: Cannot pre-filter fact tables before non-equi join operations (date arithmetic, range comparisons, quantity < quantity). Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which is O(N*M).
  Why: Hash joins require equi-conditions. Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which processes all input rows. The optimizer cannot recognize that reducing N or M via pre-filtering would dramatically reduce cost.
  Opportunity: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
  What worked:
    + Q072: 2.68x — pre-filtered catalog_sales by wholesale_cost range before non-equi quantity comparison with inventory. Reduced nested-loop input by ~70%.
  What didn't work:
    - Q013: 0.79x — pre-filtered with UNION/OR superset (loose filter). CTE fence blocked dimension predicate pushdown.
  Field notes:
    * Look for non-equi join conditions: >, <, BETWEEN, date arithmetic, quantity comparisons.
    * EXPLAIN will show nested-loop join with high row estimates on both sides.
    * A simple range filter on the fact table (e.g., wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54) works well. A union/OR superset filter does NOT — it materializes too many rows.
    * Only pre-filter when one side of the non-equi join is a large fact table. Small dimension tables (<10K rows) don't benefit.
    * The CTE fence cost is negligible vs the non-equi join savings when the filter is tight.
    * Validate at target scale — non-equi join cost grows super-linearly, so wins tend to hold or improve at larger scales.

**CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE** [MEDIUM]
  What: PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default (multi-referenced) or by choice (AS MATERIALIZED). This creates a hard optimization fence — no predicate pushdown from outer query into CTE. This makes CTE-based strategies a double-edged sword on PG.
  Why: CTE is computed and stored in memory/temp before the outer query executes. Any WHERE clause filters in the outer query cannot be pushed back into the CTE definition. Single-reference CTEs may be inlined in PG 12+, but multi-referenced CTEs are always materialized.
  Opportunity: Use materialization STRATEGICALLY: materialize when the CTE is expensive and reused multiple times. Avoid CTEs that fence off predicate pushdown for single-use cases.
  What worked:
    + Q065: 1.95x — strategic materialization prevented redundant fact table scan multiplication
  What didn't work:
    - Q031: 0.74x — CTE fence blocked predicate pushdown that worked in original
    - Q038: 0.77x — date_cte_isolate added fence that blocked INTERSECT optimization
    - Q064: 0.65x — duplicated 18-table CTE body to push filters inside. NEVER do this — computing an 18-table join twice is always worse than computing once and filtering.
  Field notes:
    * NEVER duplicate a CTE body to push a filter inside when the CTE contains 5+ table joins. Filter the materialized result with WHERE, don't recompute.
    * Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PG auto-materializes when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (<1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead (0.69x observed on Q080).
    * CTE fence + EXISTS = disaster. If the query uses EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, a CTE that fences off the semi-join optimization is actively harmful.
    * CTE fence + INTERSECT/EXCEPT = harmful. Set operations handle their inputs efficiently inline. A CTE fence per branch adds overhead.
    * A CTE result referenced 2+ times is materialized once, probed many — this IS the valid use case for CTEs on PG.
    * When a date_cte_isolate CTE is applied to UNION ALL branches, apply to ALL branches or NONE. Partial application creates asymmetric plans.

**CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS** [MEDIUM]
  What: Same gap as DuckDB but WORSE on PostgreSQL because CTE materialization fence makes it more impactful. Predicates in the outer WHERE cannot propagate into materialized CTEs.
  Why: Even single-reference CTEs may be materialized (version-dependent). The optimizer does not trace data lineage through CTE boundaries.
  Opportunity: Same as DuckDB: pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious — only when the CTE is clearly suboptimal.
  What worked:
    + Q080: 3.32x — date filter + comma-join conversion (the combo is key)
    + Q099: 2.28x — date CTE with explicit JOIN
  What didn't work:
    - Q027: 0.97x — won at SF5 (9.62x) but neutral at SF10. Cost model unreliability across scale.
    - Q031: 0.55x — over-decomposed an already-efficient query
  Field notes:
    * Convert comma-joins to explicit JOINs simultaneously — the CTE alone often isn't enough on PG.
    * EXPLAIN will show sequential scan on dimension table without index condition — that's the signal.
    * Don't use this on queries with INTERSECT, EXCEPT, or set operations — the CTE fence blocks set operation optimization.
    * If the query already returns quickly (<100ms), the CTE materialization overhead can negate any savings.
    * Validate at target scale — SF5 wins don't reliably predict SF10 on PostgreSQL.

**SCALE WARNING**: PostgreSQL optimizations validated at SF5 do NOT reliably predict SF10 behavior. 7 queries that won at SF5 regressed at SF10 (Q027 9.62x at SF5 but 0.97x at SF10). Always validate at target scale. Cost estimates are overconfident on sample data.

## Correctness Constraints (4 — NEVER violate)

**[CRITICAL] LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**[CRITICAL] SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

**[CRITICAL] COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**[CRITICAL] CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.
  - Failure: Q21 — prefetched_inventory CTE omits i_item_id but main query references it in SELECT and GROUP BY
  - Failure: Q76 — filtered_store_dates CTE omits d_year and d_qoy but aggregation CTE uses them in GROUP BY

## Your Task

First, use a `<reasoning>` block for your internal analysis. This will be stripped before parsing. Work through these steps IN ORDER:

1. **CLASSIFY**: What structural archetype is this query?
   (channel-comparison self-join / correlated-aggregate filter / star-join with late dim filter / repeated fact scan / multi-channel UNION ALL / EXISTS-set operations / other)

2. **EXPLAIN PLAN ANALYSIS**: From the EXPLAIN plan (planner estimates), identify:
   - Compare estimated row counts and costs per node. These are planner predictions, not measurements — use them directionally. Cross-check against schema knowledge (table sizes, index selectivity) where estimates look suspect.
   - Which nodes have the highest estimated cost and WHY
   - Where estimated row counts drop sharply (existing selectivity)
   - Where estimated row counts DON'T drop (missed optimization opportunity)
   - Whether the optimizer already splits CTEs, pushes predicates, or performs transforms you might otherwise assign
   - Count scans per base table. If a fact table is scanned N times, a restructuring that reduces it to 1 scan saves (N-1)/N of that table's I/O cost. Prioritize transforms that reduce scan count on the largest tables.
   - Whether the CTE is materialized once and probed multiple times, or re-executed per reference

3. **GAP MATCHING**: Compare the EXPLAIN analysis to the Engine Profile gaps above. For each gap:
   - Does this query exhibit the gap? (e.g., is a predicate NOT pushed into a CTE? Is the same fact table scanned multiple times?)
   - Check the 'opportunity' — does this query's structure match?
   - Check 'what_didnt_work' and 'field_notes' — any disqualifiers for this query?
   - Also verify: is the optimizer ALREADY handling this well? (Check the Optimizer Strengths above — if the engine already does it, your transform adds overhead, not value.)

4. **AGGREGATION TRAP CHECK**: For every aggregate function in the query, verify: does my proposed restructuring change which rows participate in each group? STDDEV_SAMP, VARIANCE, PERCENTILE_CONT, CORR are grouping-sensitive. SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX are grouping-insensitive (modulo duplicates). If the query uses FILTER clauses or conditional aggregation, verify equivalence explicitly.

5. **TRANSFORM SELECTION**: From the matched engine gaps, select transforms that exploit the specific gaps present in THIS query. Rank by expected value (rows affected × historical speedup from evidence). Select 4 that are structurally diverse — each attacking a different gap or bottleneck.
   REJECT tag-matched examples whose primary technique requires a structural feature this query lacks (e.g., reject intersect_to_exists if query has no INTERSECT; reject decorrelate if query has no correlated subquery). Tag matching is approximate — always verify structural applicability.

6. **DAG DESIGN**: For each worker's strategy, define the target DAG topology. Verify that every node contract has exhaustive output columns by checking downstream references.
   CTE materialization matters for your design: a CTE referenced by 2+ consumers will likely be materialized (good — computed once, probed many). A CTE referenced once may be inlined (no materialization benefit from 'sharing'). Design shared CTEs only when multiple downstream nodes consume them. See CTE_INLINING in Engine Profile strengths.

Then produce the structured briefing in EXACTLY this format:

## Section Validation Checklist (MUST pass before final output)

Use this checklist to verify content quality, not just section presence:

### SHARED BRIEFING
- `SEMANTIC_CONTRACT`: 80-150 tokens and includes business intent, JOIN semantics, aggregation trap, and filter dependency.
- `BOTTLENECK_DIAGNOSIS`: states dominant mechanism, bound type (`scan-bound`/`join-bound`/`aggregation-bound`), cardinality flow, and what optimizer already handles well.
- `ACTIVE_CONSTRAINTS`: includes all 4 correctness IDs plus 1-3 active engine gaps with EXPLAIN evidence.
- `REGRESSION_WARNINGS`: either `None applicable.` or numbered entries with both `CAUSE:` and `RULE:`.

### WORKER N BRIEFING (N=1..4)
- `STRATEGY`: non-empty and unique across workers.
- `TARGET_DAG`: explicit node chain (e.g., `a -> b -> c`).
- `NODE_CONTRACTS`: every DAG node has a contract with `FROM`, `OUTPUT` (explicit columns), and `CONSUMERS`.
- `EXAMPLES`: 1-3 IDs per worker. Sharing an example across workers is allowed if each worker's EXAMPLE_ADAPTATION explains a different aspect to apply.
- `EXAMPLE_ADAPTATION`: for each example, states what to adapt and what to ignore for this worker's strategy.
- `HAZARD_FLAGS`: query-specific risks, not generic cautions.

### WORKER 4 EXPLORATION FIELDS
- Includes `CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE`, `OVERRIDE_REASONING`, and `EXPLORATION_TYPE`.

## Transform Catalog

Select 4 transforms that are applicable to THIS query, maximizing structural diversity (each must attack a different part of the execution plan).

### Predicate Movement
- **global_predicate_pushdown**: Trace selective predicates from late in the CTE chain back to the earliest scan via join equivalences. Biggest win when a dimension filter is applied after a large intermediate materialization.
  Maps to examples: pushdown, early_filter, date_cte_isolate
- **transitive_predicate_propagation**: Infer predicates through join equivalence chains (A.key = B.key AND B.key = 5 -> A.key = 5). Especially across CTE boundaries where optimizers stop propagating.
  Maps to examples: early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
- **null_rejecting_join_simplification**: When downstream WHERE rejects NULLs from the outer side of a LEFT JOIN, convert to INNER. Enables reordering and predicate pushdown. CHECK: does the query actually have LEFT/OUTER joins before assigning this.
  Maps to examples: (no direct gold example — novel transform)

### Join Restructuring
- **self_join_elimination**: When a UNION ALL CTE is self-joined N times with each join filtering to a different discriminator, split into N pre-partitioned CTEs. Eliminates discriminator filtering and repeated hash probes on rows that don't match.
  Maps to examples: union_cte_split, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **decorrelation**: Convert correlated EXISTS/IN/scalar subqueries to CTE + JOIN. CHECK: does the query actually have correlated subqueries before assigning this.
  Maps to examples: decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union
- **aggregate_pushdown**: When GROUP BY follows a multi-table join but aggregation only uses columns from one side, push the GROUP BY below the join. CHECK: verify the join doesn't change row multiplicity for the aggregate (one-to-many breaks AVG/STDDEV).
  Maps to examples: (no direct gold example — novel transform)
- **late_attribute_binding**: When a dimension table is joined only to resolve display columns (names, descriptions) that aren't used in filters, aggregations, or join conditions, defer that join until after all filtering and aggregation is complete. Join on the surrogate key once against the final reduced result set. This eliminates N-1 dimension scans when the CTE references the dimension N times. CHECK: verify the deferred columns aren't used in WHERE, GROUP BY, or JOIN ON — only in the final SELECT.
  Maps to examples: dimension_cte_isolate (partial pattern), early_filter

### Scan Optimization
- **star_join_prefetch**: Pre-filter ALL dimension tables into CTEs, then probe fact table with the combined key intersection.
  Maps to examples: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, date_cte_isolate
- **single_pass_aggregation**: Merge N subqueries on the same fact table into 1 scan with CASE/FILTER inside aggregates. CHECK: STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
  Maps to examples: single_pass_aggregation, channel_bitmap_aggregation
- **scan_consolidation_pivot**: When a CTE is self-joined N times with each reference filtering to a different discriminator (e.g., year, channel), consolidate into fewer scans that GROUP BY the discriminator, then pivot rows to columns using MAX(CASE WHEN discriminator = X THEN agg_value END). This halves the fact scans and dimension joins. SAFE when GROUP BY includes the discriminator — each group is naturally partitioned, so aggregates like STDDEV_SAMP are computed correctly per-partition. The pivot MAX is just a row selector (one row per group), not a real aggregation.
  Maps to examples: single_pass_aggregation, union_cte_split

### Structural Transforms
- **union_consolidation**: Share dimension lookups across UNION ALL branches that scan different fact tables with the same dim joins.
  Maps to examples: shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **window_optimization**: Push filters before window functions when they don't affect the frame. Convert ROW_NUMBER + filter to LATERAL + LIMIT. Merge same-PARTITION windows into one sort pass.
  Maps to examples: deferred_window_aggregation
- **exists_restructuring**: Convert INTERSECT to EXISTS for semi-join short-circuit, or restructure complex EXISTS with shared CTEs. CHECK: does the query actually have INTERSECT or complex EXISTS.
  Maps to examples: intersect_to_exists, multi_intersect_exists_cte

## Strategy Selection Rules

1. **CHECK APPLICABILITY**: Each transform has a structural prerequisite (correlated subquery, UNION ALL CTE, LEFT JOIN, etc.). Verify the query actually has the prerequisite before assigning a transform. DO NOT assign decorrelation if there are no correlated subqueries.
2. **CHECK OPTIMIZER OVERLAP**: Read the EXPLAIN plan. If the optimizer already performs a transform (e.g., already splits a UNION CTE, already pushes a predicate), that transform will have marginal benefit. Note this in your reasoning and prefer transforms the optimizer is NOT already doing.
3. **MAXIMIZE DIVERSITY**: Each worker must attack a different part of the execution plan. Do not assign 'pushdown variant A' and 'pushdown variant B'. Assign transforms from different categories above.
4. **ASSESS RISK PER-QUERY**: Risk is a function of (transform x query complexity), not an inherent property of the transform. Decorrelation is low-risk on a simple EXISTS and high-risk on nested correlation inside a CTE. Assess per-assignment.
5. **COMPOSITION IS ALLOWED AND ENCOURAGED**: A worker's strategy can combine 2-3 transforms from different categories (e.g., star_join_prefetch + scan_consolidation_pivot, or date_cte_isolate + early_filter + decorrelate). The TARGET_DAG should reflect the combined structure. Do not assign two workers the same composition — each must include at least one unique transform. Compound strategies are often the source of the biggest wins.
6. **MINIMAL-CHANGE BASELINE**: If the EXPLAIN shows the optimizer already handles the primary bottleneck (e.g., already splits CTEs, already pushes predicates), consider assigning one worker as a minimal-change baseline: explicit JOINs only, no structural changes. This provides a regression-safe fallback.

Each worker gets 1-3 examples. If fewer than 2 examples genuinely match the worker's strategy, assign 1 and state 'No additional examples apply.' Do NOT pad with irrelevant examples — an irrelevant example is worse than no example because the worker will try to apply its pattern. No duplicate examples across workers. Use example IDs from the catalog above.

For TARGET_DAG: Define the CTE structure you want the worker to produce. The worker's job becomes pure SQL generation within your defined structure. For NODE_CONTRACTS: Be exhaustive with OUTPUT columns — missing columns cause semantic breaks.

## Exploration Budget (Worker 4)

Workers 1-3 follow the engine profile's proven patterns. **Worker 4 is the EXPLORATION worker** with a different mandate:

Worker 4 MAY (in priority order — prefer higher-value exploration):
  (c) **PREFERRED**: Attempt a novel technique not listed in the engine profile, if the EXPLAIN plan reveals an optimizer blind spot not yet documented. This is the highest-value exploration — new discoveries expand the engine profile for all future queries.
  (b) Combine 2-3 transforms from different engine gaps into a compound strategy that hasn't been tested before. Medium value — tests interaction effects between known patterns.
  (a) Retry a technique from 'what_didnt_work', IF the structural context of THIS query differs materially from the observed failure — explain the structural difference in HAZARD_FLAGS. Lowest priority — only when the query structure clearly diverges from the failed case.

Worker 4 may NEVER violate correctness constraints (LITERAL_PRESERVATION, SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE, COMPLETE_OUTPUT, CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS).

The exploration worker's output is tagged EXPLORATORY and tracked separately. Past failures documented in the engine profile are context-specific — they happened on specific queries with specific structures. Worker 4's job is to test whether those failures generalize or not. If Worker 4 discovers a new win, it becomes field intelligence for the engine profile.

## Output Consumption Spec

Each worker receives:
1. SHARED BRIEFING (SEMANTIC_CONTRACT + BOTTLENECK_DIAGNOSIS + ACTIVE_CONSTRAINTS + REGRESSION_WARNINGS)
2. Their specific WORKER N BRIEFING (STRATEGY + TARGET_DAG + NODE_CONTRACTS + EXAMPLES + EXAMPLE_ADAPTATION + HAZARD_FLAGS)
3. Full before/after SQL for their assigned examples (retrieved by example ID)
4. The original query SQL (full, as reference)
5. Column completeness contract + output format spec

Workers do NOT see other workers' briefings.
Presentation order: briefing first (understanding), then examples (patterns), then original SQL (source), then output format (mechanics).
