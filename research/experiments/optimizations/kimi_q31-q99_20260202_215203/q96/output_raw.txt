  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to push selective predicates on dimension tables (time_dim, household_demographics, store) into separate CTEs before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the cardinality of dimension scans and the size of hash tables built for joins. The filters s_store_name='ese' and hd_dep_count=3 are highly selective, and filtering time_dim early eliminates irrelevant time slots before the join."
