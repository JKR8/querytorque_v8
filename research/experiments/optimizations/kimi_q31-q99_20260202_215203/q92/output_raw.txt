  "explanation": "Decorrelated the scalar subquery by computing the 1.3x average discount per item as a separate grouped CTE (item_avg_discount) rather than a correlated subquery executed per row. Pushed down the date range filter into filtered_dates CTE used by both the average calculation and main query. Pushed down i_manufact_id=320 filter into filtered_items CTE to limit computation to relevant items only. The main query now joins these pre-computed results instead of using a dependent subquery, enabling hash joins and eliminating repeated scans of web_sales."
