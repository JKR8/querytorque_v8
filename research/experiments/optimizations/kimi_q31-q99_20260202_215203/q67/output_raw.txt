  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to the date_dim table to ensure the d_month_seq predicate is evaluated before joining to the large store_sales fact table. This reduces the intermediate result set size early in the pipeline. The query structure is preserved with explicit CTEs (filtered_dates, dw1, dw2) to ensure the optimizer recognizes the filter pushdown opportunity."
