  "explanation": "Converted IN subquery to EXISTS for early termination (rs_01), and alternatively eliminated the subquery entirely by pushing the i_category filter down to the outer item table join (rs_02). Both approaches preserve the semi-join semantics while improving performance; the pushdown variant avoids the subquery overhead entirely by filtering the item table directly since it is already joined in the outer query."
