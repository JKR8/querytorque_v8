 The user wants me to optimize a SQL query using the allowed transforms. Let me analyze the input query.

The query is a UNION of three similar queries (web, catalog, store) that calculate return ratios and currency ratios, rank them, and filter for top 10 in either ranking.

Looking at the structure:
1. Each branch (web, catalog, store) has a similar pattern:
   - Join sales with returns (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
   - Join with date_dim
   - Filter: return_amount > 10000, net_profit > 1, net_paid > 0, quantity > 0, year = 1999, month = 12
   - Group by item
   - Calculate ratios
   - Rank by ratios
   - Filter: return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10

The detected opportunity mentions OR_TO_UNION for the main_query. However, looking at the query, the OR condition is inside each subquery (web, catalog, store) where it filters `(return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10)`.

But wait, the query is already a UNION of three branches. The OR condition is within each branch's WHERE clause.

Actually, looking more carefully:
- The outer query has: `WHERE (web.return_rank <= 10 OR web.currency_rank <= 10)` for the web subquery, and similar for catalog and store.
- But these are inside derived tables (subqueries in the FROM clause).

The detected opportunity says: "OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition" - this refers to the OR condition in the WHERE clause of each derived table (web, catalog, store).

However, there's another issue: the query is doing a LEFT OUTER JOIN with returns, but then filtering on `wr_return_amt > 10000` (or cr_return_amount, sr_return_amt). This filter is on the right side of a LEFT JOIN, which effectively turns it into an INNER JOIN because NULL values won't satisfy > 10000. But that's not the main optimization here.

The main optimization suggested is OR_TO_UNION. The pattern is:
- Currently: `WHERE (return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10)`
- This requires calculating both ranks and then filtering
- Optimization: Split into two UNION ALL branches - one for return_rank <= 10 and one for currency_rank <= 10
- But we need to be careful about duplicates - if an item is in top 10 for both, it should appear twice? No, looking at the logic, it seems we want items that are in top 10 of either. But UNION removes duplicates, UNION ALL keeps them. The original query would return a row if either condition is met, but each item appears only once per channel because it's grouped by item.

Wait, looking at the inner query:
- It groups by item
- Calculates two ratios
- Calculates two ranks (window functions)
- Then filters where either rank <= 10

If we split into UNION ALL:
- Branch 1: return_rank <= 10
- Branch 2: currency_rank <= 10
This could produce duplicates if an item is in top 10 of both. But the original query would only return one row per item. So we need UNION (distinct) or handle the duplication.

Actually, looking at the query structure again:
- The inner query produces: item, return_ratio, currency_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank
- The outer filter is: WHERE (return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10)

If we use UNION ALL, we might get duplicates. But the original query uses UNION (not UNION ALL) between the three channels. Wait, looking at the SQL:
- It says `UNION SELECT 'catalog'...` and `UNION SELECT 'store'...`
- In SQL, UNION without ALL implies DISTINCT.

But for the OR condition within each channel, if we convert OR to UNION, we need to ensure we don't create duplicates when an item satisfies both conditions.

However, looking at the example provided in the prompt for OR_TO_UNION:
- It shows splitting OR conditions into separate UNION ALL branches
- Each branch has the full query with one part of the OR condition
- This works when the OR is on different columns and we want to avoid scanning the table multiple times or to enable better index usage, but actually, OR conditions often prevent index usage.

Wait, in the example:
- Original: `OR ca_state IN (...) OR cs_sales_price > 500`
- Rewrite: Three UNION ALL branches, each with one condition
- This allows each branch to use appropriate indexes.

In our case:
- The OR is on calculated window functions: `return_rank <= 10 OR currency_rank <= 10`
- We can't easily push this down before the window functions are calculated.
- But we can calculate the window functions, then filter with OR, or we can split into two queries and UNION them.

However, there's a subtlety: RANK() is calculated over the entire set. If we split into two queries:
- Query 1: Calculate return_rank, filter return_rank <= 10
- Query 2: Calculate currency_rank, filter currency_rank <= 10
- Then UNION them

But if we do that, we calculate the window functions separately. In Query 1, we only need to calculate RANK() OVER (ORDER BY return_ratio). In Query 2, we only need RANK() OVER (ORDER BY currency_ratio). This could be more efficient than calculating both ranks for all items and then filtering.

Also, we can push down other filters early.

Let me look at the structure again. The query has three channels (web, catalog, store) that are unioned together. Each channel has the same pattern.

The optimization should apply to each channel's subquery. But since the rewrite_sets need to coordinate multi-node changes, and the main_query is the outermost query, I need to define nodes for the subqueries.

Actually, looking at the "Target Nodes" section: `[main_query] GROUP_BY` - this suggests the main_query is the focus.

But the SQL shows the main_query is the whole thing. The GROUP_BY is mentioned as a node type.

Let me reconsider the detected opportunity: "OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition"

The OR conditions are at the end of each subquery:
- `WHERE (web.return_rank <= 10 OR web.currency_rank <= 10)`
- `WHERE (catalog.return_rank <= 10 OR catalog.currency_rank <= 10)`
- `WHERE (store.return_rank <= 10 OR store.currency_rank <= 10)`

To apply OR_TO_UNION, I would need to split each of these into two branches. But since there are three channels, splitting each into two would give 6 branches total.

However, looking at the example, the OR_TO_UNION transform splits the query into multiple branches of a UNION ALL.

So for the web channel:
- Branch 1: ... calculate both ratios and ranks ... WHERE return_rank <= 10
- Branch 2: ... calculate both ratios and ranks ... WHERE currency_rank <= 10
- Then UNION ALL these two, but we need to handle duplicates (items appearing in both top 10s)

Actually, if an item is top 10 in both, it should appear once in the final output (since the original query uses OR, not "XOR"). So we should use UNION (distinct), not UNION ALL.

But wait, the example uses UNION ALL. Let me check the example again...

Example:
```
UNION ALL SELECT ... WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN (...)
UNION ALL SELECT ... WHERE ca_state IN (...)
UNION ALL SELECT ... WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```

These conditions are mutually exclusive? Not necessarily, but the aggregation is done after the union. In our case, the aggregation (GROUP BY) is done before the filter.

In our query:
1. GROUP BY item - produces one row per item with aggregated sums
2. Calculate window functions (ranks) over the grouped results
3. Filter with OR condition

If we split into UNION ALL:
- Branch A: GROUP BY item, calculate return_ratio, calculate return_rank, filter return_rank <= 10
- Branch B: GROUP BY item, calculate currency_ratio, calculate currency_rank, filter currency_rank <= 10
- UNION ALL Branch A and Branch B

But this produces duplicates if an item is in top 10 of both. The original query would produce only one row per item. So we need to deduplicate, or use a different approach.

Alternative: Use UNION (without ALL) to deduplicate automatically.

But looking at the example output, it uses UNION ALL. Why? Because the conditions in the example are likely mutually exclusive or the aggregation handles it? Actually, in the example, the aggregation (GROUP BY) happens after the UNION ALL. So if a row satisfies multiple conditions, it would be counted multiple times in the aggregation if we use UNION ALL. But the original OR condition would count it only once.

Wait, in the example:
- Original: `WHERE (condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3)`
- Rewrite: `UNION ALL (SELECT ... WHERE condition1) UNION ALL (SELECT ... WHERE condition2) ...`
- Then GROUP BY happens after.

If a row satisfies condition1 and condition2, it appears twice in the UNION ALL, and would be aggregated twice, giving wrong results. So either:
1. The conditions are mutually exclusive, or
2. The example is wrong, or
3. I'm misunderstanding the example.

Looking closely at the example:
- Condition 1: `substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', ...)`
- Condition 2: `ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')`
- Condition 3: `cs_sales_price > 500`

These are not mutually exclusive. A row could have ca_zip in the list AND ca_state in the list. So UNION ALL would be wrong unless there's a DISTINCT somewhere or the aggregation handles it differently.

Wait, looking at the example output SQL:
```
"filtered_sales": "SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN (...) UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE ca_state IN (...) UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE cs_sales_price > 500",
"main_query": "SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip..."
```

If a row satisfies multiple conditions, it appears multiple times in filtered_sales, and gets summed multiple times in the main_query. This would be incorrect compared to the original OR condition.

Unless... the original query is actually:
```
WHERE (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN (...) OR ca_state IN (...) OR cs_sales_price > 500)
```
And the rewrite assumes that the conditions are on different tables or that the optimizer will handle it, or... actually, looking at TPC-DS query 49 (which this appears to be), the OR conditions are indeed mutually exclusive in the sense that the query is designed to test different access paths, but logically, if a row satisfies multiple conditions, it should only be counted once.

But in TPC-DS, sometimes the OR conditions are transformed to UNION ALL with the assumption that the overlap is negligible or handled by the specific data distribution, or the query is designed such that they are mutually exclusive. Actually, looking at TPC-DS query 49, the OR condition is on the ranks, which can overlap.

Wait, I think I see the issue. In the example provided in the prompt, the OR conditions are on different columns and the query is doing a GROUP BY. If we use UNION ALL, we double-count. But maybe the example is simplified or assumes we use UNION (distinct)? No, it clearly says UNION ALL.

Let me reconsider. Maybe the OR_TO_UNION transform is only valid when the OR conditions are on different tables or when we don't care about duplicates? Or maybe I'm supposed to use UNION (without ALL) to avoid duplicates?

Actually, looking at standard SQL optimization, converting OR to UNION is a valid technique, but you must use UNION (distinct) if the conditions overlap, or UNION ALL if they are mutually exclusive.

Given that the example uses UNION ALL, and this is a standard TPC-DS optimization example, I will assume that for the purpose of this exercise, we use UNION ALL and assume the conditions are treated as separate branches, and perhaps the deduplication is handled by the GROUP BY if the grouping keys are unique per row? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the example, the main query does GROUP BY ca_zip. If a row appears twice (satisfies two conditions), it contributes twice to the sum for that ca_zip, which is wrong.

Unless... the original query is actually using OR on conditions that are mutually exclusive by design? No, ca_zip and ca_state are correlated.

Let me look up TPC-DS query 49. Actually, the input query looks like TPC-DS query 49. Let me check the structure.

TPC-DS Query 49:
```sql
select  channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank from
 (select 'web' as channel
         ,web.item
         ,web.return_ratio
         ,web.return_rank
         ,web.currency_rank
 from (
 	select item 
 	       ,return_ratio
 	       ,currency_ratio
 	       ,rank() over (order by return_ratio) as return_rank
 	       ,rank() over (order by currency_ratio) as currency_rank
 	from
 	(	select ws.ws_item_sk as item
 		,(cast(sum(coalesce(wr.wr_return_quantity,0)) as decimal(15,4))/
 		cast(sum(coalesce(ws.ws_quantity,0)) as decimal(15,4) )) as return_ratio
 		,(cast(sum(coalesce(wr.wr_return_amt,0)) as decimal(15,4))/
 		cast(sum(coalesce(ws.ws_net_paid,0)) as decimal(15,4) )) as currency_ratio
 		from 
 		 web_sales ws left outer join web_returns wr 
 		         on (ws.ws_order_number = wr.wr_order_number and 
 		         ws.ws_item_sk = wr.wr_item_sk),
 		 date_dim
 		where 
 			wr.wr_return_amt > 10000 
 			and ws.ws_net_profit > 1
                         and ws.ws_net_paid > 0
                         and ws.ws_quantity > 0
 			and ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
 			and d_year = 1999
 			and d_moy = 12
 		group by ws.ws_item_sk
 	) in_web
 ) web
 where 
 (
 web.return_rank <= 10
 or 
 web.currency_rank <= 10
 )
 union
...
```

Yes, this is TPC-DS Q49.

The standard optimization for this query is indeed to convert the OR condition on the window functions to a UNION ALL of two queries, one filtering on return_rank and one on currency_rank. But since an item can be in both top 10s, we need to handle duplicates.

However, looking at the query, the outermost part is a UNION of three channels. Each channel has the OR filter.

If we convert the OR to UNION ALL for each channel, we get 6 subqueries (2 per channel). But we need to ensure that if an item is top 10 in both, it doesn't appear twice in the final output for that channel.

Actually, looking at the query output, it selects channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank. If an item is top 10 in both, it should appear once with both ranks calculated. If we split into two branches:
- Branch 1: calculates return_rank, filters return_rank <= 10, has currency_rank calculated but not filtered
- Branch 2: calculates currency_rank, filters currency_rank <= 10, has return_rank calculated but not filtered

If we UNION ALL these, and an item is in both, we get two rows. We need to merge them or use UNION.

But if we use UNION (distinct), we lose one of the rows arbitrarily? No, UNION removes exact duplicates. But the rows won't be exact duplicates because return_rank and currency_rank will have different values in the two branches? No, both branches calculate both ranks. So the rows would be identical if the item is in both top 10s. So UNION (without ALL) would work.

But the example uses UNION ALL. Maybe for this specific exercise, I should follow the pattern and use UNION ALL, assuming that's what's expected.

Actually, looking at the detected opportunity text: "OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition - Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches"

So I should use UNION ALL.

Now, for the rewrite_sets structure:

I need to define nodes. The main_query is the outermost query. But the OR conditions are inside the subqueries web, catalog, and store.

I should define:
- web_filtered_return_rank: the web subquery part with return_rank <= 10
- web_filtered_currency_rank: the web subquery part with currency_rank <= 10
- Similarly for catalog and store
- Then the main_query unions them all together

But that's 6 subqueries. I can group them logically.

Actually, looking at the example format, the nodes can be:
- web_returns_top: for web channel return_rank filter
- web_currency_top: for web channel currency_rank filter
- catalog_returns_top: for catalog...
- catalog_currency_top: ...
- store_returns_top: ...
- store_currency_top: ...
- main_query: unions all of them

But that's verbose. Maybe I can combine them per channel using UNION ALL in the node definition.

Wait, the example shows:
```
"filtered_sales": "SELECT ... UNION ALL SELECT ... UNION ALL SELECT ..."
```

So I can have intermediate nodes that are the union of the split OR conditions.

For each channel (web, catalog, store):
- Create a node that is the UNION ALL of the two filtered versions

Then the main_query unions the three channel nodes.

But actually, the main_query already unions the three channels. So I just need to replace each channel subquery with a UNION ALL of the two filtered versions.

Let me draft the SQL:

For web channel:
Original:
```sql
SELECT 'web' AS channel, web.item, web.return_ratio, web.return_rank, web.currency_rank 
FROM (
  SELECT item, return_ratio, currency_ratio, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY return_ratio) AS return_rank, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY currency_ratio) AS currency_rank 
  FROM (
    SELECT ws.ws_item_sk AS item, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS return_ratio, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_amt, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_net_paid, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS currency_ratio 
    FROM web_sales AS ws 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN web_returns AS wr ON (ws.ws_order_number = wr.wr_order_number AND ws.ws_item_sk = wr.wr_item_sk), 
    date_dim 
    WHERE wr.wr_return_amt > 10000 
      AND ws.ws_net_profit > 1 
      AND ws.ws_net_paid > 0 
      AND ws.ws_quantity > 0 
      AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
      AND d_year = 1999 
      AND d_moy = 12 
    GROUP BY ws.ws_item_sk
  ) AS in_web
) AS web 
WHERE (web.return_rank <= 10 OR web.currency_rank <= 10)
```

Rewrite for web:
```sql
SELECT 'web' AS channel, t.item, t.return_ratio, t.return_rank, t.currency_rank 
FROM (
  SELECT item, return_ratio, currency_ratio, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY return_ratio) AS return_rank, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY currency_ratio) AS currency_rank 
  FROM (
    SELECT ws.ws_item_sk AS item, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS return_ratio, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_amt, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_net_paid, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS currency_ratio 
    FROM web_sales AS ws 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN web_returns AS wr ON (ws.ws_order_number = wr.wr_order_number AND ws.ws_item_sk = wr.wr_item_sk), 
    date_dim 
    WHERE wr.wr_return_amt > 10000 
      AND ws.ws_net_profit > 1 
      AND ws.ws_net_paid > 0 
      AND ws.ws_quantity > 0 
      AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
      AND d_year = 1999 
      AND d_moy = 12 
    GROUP BY ws.ws_item_sk
  ) AS in_web
) AS t 
WHERE t.return_rank <= 10
UNION ALL
SELECT 'web' AS channel, t.item, t.return_ratio, t.return_rank, t.currency_rank 
FROM (
  SELECT item, return_ratio, currency_ratio, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY return_ratio) AS return_rank, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY currency_ratio) AS currency_rank 
  FROM (
    SELECT ws.ws_item_sk AS item, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_quantity, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS return_ratio, 
           (CAST(SUM(COALESCE(wr.wr_return_amt, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4)) / CAST(SUM(COALESCE(ws.ws_net_paid, 0)) AS DECIMAL(15, 4))) AS currency_ratio 
    FROM web_sales AS ws 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN web_returns AS wr ON (ws.ws_order_number = wr.wr_order_number AND ws.ws_item_sk = wr.wr_item_sk), 
    date_dim 
    WHERE wr.wr_return_amt > 10000 
      AND ws.ws_net_profit > 1 
      AND ws.ws_net_paid > 0 
      AND ws.ws_quantity > 0 
      AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk 
      AND d_year = 1999 
      AND d_moy = 12 
    GROUP BY ws.ws_item_sk
  ) AS in_web
) AS t 
WHERE t.currency_rank <= 10
```

But this duplicates the heavy aggregation subquery. We can factor that out.

Better approach:
- Create a CTE or subquery for the aggregated data (in_web)
- Then create two branches that calculate the respective rank and filter

Actually, looking at the structure, we can have:
- web_agg: the inner aggregation query (GROUP BY)
- web_top_return: select from web_agg, calculate both ranks, filter return_rank <= 10
- web_top_currency: select from web_agg, calculate both ranks, filter currency_rank <= 10
- web_channel: UNION ALL of web_top_return and web_top_currency

Similarly for catalog and store.

Then main_query unions web_channel, catalog_channel, store_channel.

This avoids recomputing the aggregation.

So the nodes would be:
- web_agg
- web_top_return
- web_top_currency
- web_channel (or just inline the union in main_query)

But looking at the example format, they define nodes with SQL strings.

Let me structure it:

      },
      ...
    }
  ]

Wait, but I can't reference window functions in the WHERE clause of the same query level. The RANK() is calculated in the SELECT, and I need to filter on it. In SQL, you can't do `WHERE return_rank <= 10` in the same query where you define `RANK() OVER ... AS return_rank`. You need a subquery or CTE.

So web_top_return should be:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 'web' AS channel, item, return_ratio, currency_ratio, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY return_ratio) AS return_rank, 
         RANK() OVER (ORDER BY currency_ratio) AS currency_rank 
  FROM web_agg
) t WHERE return_rank <= 10
```

Similarly for the others.

Also, I notice that the original query selects specific columns: channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank. It does not select currency_ratio. So I should not select currency_ratio in the final output, but I need it to calculate currency_rank.

Actually, looking at the original:
```sql
SELECT channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank FROM ...
```
So currency_ratio is not in the final output, but is needed for the window function.

Now, about the risk: if we use UNION ALL, we might get duplicates. But the original query could potentially have duplicates if an item appeared in both rankings? No, the original query has one row per item per channel, with both ranks calculated. If we split into two branches with UNION ALL, we get two rows for items that are in both top 10s.

But looking at the detected opportunity and the example, this seems to be the expected transform. Perhaps the assumption is that the overlap is small, or we should use UNION (distinct) instead of UNION ALL? But the example uses UNION ALL.

Actually, looking at the example again carefully:
```
UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') 
UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') 
UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM ... WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```

And then it groups by ca_zip and sums cs_sales_price. If a row satisfies multiple conditions, it gets counted multiple times. This is definitely wrong unless the conditions are mutually exclusive or the query is designed such that duplicates don't matter (e.g., if it's a COUNT DISTINCT or something).

But in our case, we are not aggregating after the union (except for the final ORDER BY and LIMIT). The aggregation (GROUP BY) happens before, in the agg nodes.

So if we use UNION ALL, and an item is in both top 10, we get two identical rows (except maybe the ranks are calculated but the row is the same item). This would violate the "same result rows" invariant.

Unless... we use UNION (without ALL). That would deduplicate.

But the transform is called OR_TO_UNION, and the example uses UNION ALL. Maybe I should use UNION ALL and assume that's what is expected, or maybe I should note that we use UNION ALL but the risk is medium due to potential duplicates?

Actually, looking at the expected output format, I need to provide invariants_kept. If I use UNION ALL, I cannot say "same result rows" because of potential duplicates.

But wait, looking at the original query structure again:
- The inner query groups by item, so there's one row per item.
- The window functions assign ranks.
- The OR filter keeps the row if either rank <= 10.
- If I split into two branches:
  - Branch 1: keeps row if return_rank <= 10
  - Branch 2: keeps row if currency_rank <= 10
- If an item has both ranks <= 10, it appears in both branches.
- If I UNION ALL, I get two rows.
- If I UNION (distinct), I get one row.

So to keep the same result rows, I must use UNION (without ALL), or add a DISTINCT, or group by again.

Given that the example uses UNION ALL, but that seems incorrect for the general case, I think for this specific query, I should use UNION ALL and assume that the conditions are such that we want to split the processing, but actually, looking at the query, it's possible for an item to be top 10 in both.

However, looking at the "Node Contracts" section:
```
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['channel', 'item', 'return_ratio', 'return_rank', 'currency_rank']
  grain: ['ss_item_sk']
  required_predicates: ['store.return_rank <= 10', 'store.currency_rank <= 10']
```

The grain is ss_item_sk (which corresponds to item). So each item should appear once.

Therefore, I cannot use UNION ALL if it creates duplicates. I must use UNION (without ALL).

But the example uses UNION ALL. This is a contradiction.

Let me reconsider the example. Maybe the OR conditions in the example are on different tables and the query is such that the rows are distinct? Or maybe the example is simplified and in reality, they handle it differently?

Given the instructions say "Only use transforms from the allowlist" and "Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)", and the grain is per item, I must ensure no duplicates. So I will use UNION (without ALL), or I will use UNION ALL with a GROUP BY, but that changes the structure.

Actually, looking at the example output again:
```
"filtered_sales": "SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500",
```

Maybe the logic is that by splitting the OR, each branch can use a different index, and even if there are duplicates, the final GROUP BY in the main_query will aggregate them correctly? But in the example, the main_query does GROUP BY ca_zip and SUM(cs_sales_price). If a row appears twice, it gets summed twice, which is wrong.

Unless... the original query with OR would also have counted it twice? No, OR doesn't duplicate rows.

Unless... the conditions are mutually exclusive in the data? For example, if ca_zip is in that list, ca_state cannot be in ('CA','WA','GA')? No, that's not true.

Unless... the query is TPC-DS query 55 or something similar where the OR conditions are on different line numbers or something? No.

Given this confusion, and given that the detected opportunity specifically mentions OR_TO_UNION for this query, and the grain must be preserved, I will assume that for this exercise, we use UNION ALL and accept that it might produce duplicates, or perhaps the system expects UNION ALL.

But to be safe and correct, I should use UNION (without ALL) to ensure no duplicates.

However, looking at the transform name "or_to_union", and the example using "UNION ALL", I think the expected answer uses UNION ALL. Maybe the risk is higher?

Let me check the risk field. In the example, risk is "low". If there were potential for duplicates, the risk would be higher.

Perhaps for this specific query (TPC-DS Q49), the OR condition is on window functions that are calculated on different orderings, and an item cannot be top 10 in both return_ratio and currency_ratio? No, that's not true, an item can have high return quantity and high return amount.

Unless... the query is designed such that the overlap is negligible and the performance gain outweighs the correctness issue? No, that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: maybe the OR_TO_UNION transform is applied before the window functions are calculated, and the union is used to calculate the ranks separately? No, that doesn't help.

Let me look at the structure of the rewrite one more time. Maybe I can avoid the duplicate issue by using a different approach.

Instead of:
```
SELECT ... FROM agg WHERE return_rank <= 10
UNION ALL
SELECT ... FROM agg WHERE currency_rank <= 10
```

I could use:
```
SELECT ... FROM agg WHERE return_rank <= 10
UNION ALL
SELECT ... FROM agg WHERE currency_rank <= 10 AND return_rank > 10
```
