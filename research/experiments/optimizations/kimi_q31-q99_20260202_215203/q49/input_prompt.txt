## Examples

### Example: DECORRELATE + PUSHDOWN
Input:
[customer_total_return] CORRELATED:
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 FROM customer_total_return ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk AND s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100
Output:

}
```
Key insight: Push s_state='SD' filter EARLY into first CTE. Compute average as SEPARATE CTE with GROUP BY (NOT window function). Join on average instead of correlated subquery.

### Example: OR_TO_UNION + EARLY_FILTER
Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', ...)
       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
Output:
```json

## Your Task

You are a SQL optimizer. Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Only use transforms from the allowlist
- Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)
- Coordinate multi-node changes in rewrite_sets
- No formatting-only changes
- No column renames unless required

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, in_to_exists, projection_prune, early_filter

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "transform_name",
      "nodes": {
        "node_id": "new SQL..."
      },
      "invariants_kept": ["list of preserved semantics"],
      "expected_speedup": "2x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "what was changed and why"
