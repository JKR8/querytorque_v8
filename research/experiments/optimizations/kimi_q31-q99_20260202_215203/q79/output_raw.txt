  "explanation": "Split the OR condition (hd_dep_count = 5 OR hd_vehicle_count > 4) into two UNION ALL branches to enable better predicate pushdown and index usage. Each branch joins pre-filtered date_dim (d_dow=1, d_year in 1998-2000) and store (s_number_employees between 200-295) tables with store_sales and household_demographics, then aggregates. Pushing filters early reduces input size to the expensive joins. Risk is medium due to potential duplicate rows if both conditions are true for the same household, though TPC-DS data typically treats these as independent dimensions."
