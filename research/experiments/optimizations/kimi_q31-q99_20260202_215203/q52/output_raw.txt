  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim and item) before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). By filtering date_dim to December 2002 and item to manager_id=1 in separate CTEs, we drastically reduce the input cardinality to the join and aggregation operations. This minimizes data movement and shuffle costs during the GROUP BY operation."
