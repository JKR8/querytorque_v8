  "explanation": "Extracted the date_dim filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214 + 11) into a separate filtered_dates CTE that is reused by both ssci and csci. This ensures the date dimension is filtered once before joining with the large fact tables (store_sales and catalog_sales), reducing I/O and join overhead. The filtered_dates CTE acts as an early filter that enables better partition pruning and reduces the working set for the subsequent GROUP BY operations."
