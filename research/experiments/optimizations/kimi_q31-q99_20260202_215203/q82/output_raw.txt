  "explanation": "Pushed selective predicates down to base tables before joins. Item filters (price range, manufacturer ID), inventory filter (quantity on hand), and date filter (60-day window) are applied in separate CTEs to reduce scan sizes. Projection pruning removes unused columns from intermediate results. Store_sales is projected to only the join key. This minimizes data movement through the join pipeline while preserving the exact semantics of the original query."
