  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to dimension tables item and date_dim to reduce data before joins. Filtered item by i_current_price (0.99-1.49) and date_dim by 60-day window. This eliminates scanning rows from catalog_sales that would be filtered out by these dimension predicates anyway, significantly reducing join input size."
