  "explanation": "Pushed d_year=2000 and d_qoy IN (1,2,3) predicates into both CTEs before aggregation. This reduces the amount of data processed in the GROUP BY operations by filtering date_dim early. All three references (ss1/ss2/ss3 and ws1/ws2/ws3) require year 2000 and quarters 1-3 respectively, so filtering at the source benefits all downstream joins."
