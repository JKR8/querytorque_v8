  "explanation": "Applied OR_TO_UNION to split the OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS clauses into separate UNION ALL branches. Decorrelated the subqueries by converting them to joins with pre-computed distinct customer lists (store_customers, web_customers, catalog_customers). Applied EARLY_FILTER to push d_year=2001 and d_qoy<4 predicates into the date_dim CTE. This allows the database to use hash joins instead of correlated subqueries and enables parallel execution of the two branches."
