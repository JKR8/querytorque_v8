  "explanation": "Applied OR_TO_UNION to split the date range filter in v1 into three separate UNION ALL branches. This allows the database to use partition pruning or indexes on date_dim for each specific year/month combination, reducing I/O. The GROUP BY and window functions are applied after the union to maintain correct aggregation and ranking semantics. The self-join in v2 and final filtering in main_query remain unchanged as they depend on the full windowed result set including adjacent months needed for lag/lead calculations."
