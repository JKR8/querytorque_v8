  "explanation": "Eliminated redundant IN subqueries on the item table by pushing the i_category filter directly into the WHERE clause. Since the item table is already joined in both CTEs (via ss_item_sk=i_item_sk and cs_item_sk=i_item_sk), the subquery was performing an unnecessary second scan. Converting to a direct filter avoids the correlated subquery overhead and allows the optimizer to use a single scan of the item table with the category predicate applied early."
