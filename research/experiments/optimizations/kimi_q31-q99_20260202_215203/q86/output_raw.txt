  "explanation": "Applied early_filter to pre-filter date_dim to only 12 months of data (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1235) before joining with web_sales. This reduces the intermediate join result size significantly since web_sales is typically large. Additionally, projected only necessary columns (d_date_sk from date_dim, ws_net_paid and ws_item_sk from web_sales) to minimize memory usage and I/O during query execution."
