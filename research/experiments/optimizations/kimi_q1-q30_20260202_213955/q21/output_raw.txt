  "explanation": "Applied early filtering by creating CTEs for filtered_items and filtered_dates to reduce the inventory fact table scan before joining. Projection pruning ensures only necessary columns (i_item_sk, i_item_id, d_date_sk, d_date, w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name) are carried through the pipeline. Converted the outer subquery filter to a HAVING clause to eliminate the derived table wrapper while preserving the ratio filter semantics."
