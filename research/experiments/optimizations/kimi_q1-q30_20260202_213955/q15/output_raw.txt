  "explanation": "Split the OR condition into three UNION ALL branches to enable independent index access paths and partition pruning for each predicate. Isolated the date dimension filter into a separate CTE to avoid redundant filtering across all three branches. Each branch now processes a disjoint subset of rows that can be optimized separately by the query planner."
