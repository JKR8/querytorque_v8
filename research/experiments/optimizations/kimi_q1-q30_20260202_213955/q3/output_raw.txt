  "explanation": "Pushed down predicates i_manufact_id=816 and d_moy=11 to filter dimension tables (item, date_dim) before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the join input size significantly by filtering items to only manufacturer 816 and dates to only November (month 11) before the expensive join and aggregation operations."
