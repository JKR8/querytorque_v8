  "explanation": "Eliminated 15 separate table scans by consolidating all aggregations into a single pass over store_sales using conditional aggregation (CASE expressions inside aggregate functions). The scalar subqueries are replaced with a pre-computed CTE that calculates counts, average sales prices, and average net profits for all five quantity buckets simultaneously. This reduces I/O and CPU significantly while preserving the exact semantics of the original conditional CASE logic."
