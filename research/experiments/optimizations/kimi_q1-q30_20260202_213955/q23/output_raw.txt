  "explanation": "Eliminated unnecessary joins to dimension tables by projecting only fact table columns. For frequent_ss_items, removed the join to item table (since ss_item_sk provides item_sk) and pruned unused columns itemdesc, solddate, and cnt from output while keeping them in GROUP BY/HAVING to preserve semantics. For max_store_sales, removed the join to customer table (using ss_customer_sk directly) and pruned
