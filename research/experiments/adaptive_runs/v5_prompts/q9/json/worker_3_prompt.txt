## Example: Flatten Subquery to JOIN (FLATTEN_SUBQUERY)
Verified speedup: 1.3-2.0x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
FROM customer
WHERE c_customer_sk IN (
  SELECT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000)
)

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "flatten_subquery",
      "nodes": {
        "target_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "active_customers": "SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales JOIN target_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT c.c_customer_id, c.c_first_name, c.c_last_name FROM customer c JOIN active_customers ac ON c.c_customer_sk = ac.ss_customer_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** IN subquery becomes a JOIN. Nested IN becomes chained CTEs. DISTINCT ensures no duplicates from the semi-join semantics.

## Example: Inline Single-Use CTE (INLINE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.1-1.3x

### Input:
[cte_a]:
SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000

[cte_b]:
SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Music'

[main_query]:
SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price)
FROM store_sales
JOIN cte_a ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN cte_b ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "inline_cte",
      "nodes": {
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price) FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk WHERE d_year = 2000 AND i_category = 'Music'"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.2x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Single-use CTEs can prevent optimizer from pushing predicates. Inlining allows better join ordering and predicate pushdown.

## Example: Multi-layer Predicate Pushdown (MULTI_PUSH_PREDICATE)
Verified speedup: 1.3-2.0x

### Input:
[cte_inner]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales

[cte_outer]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM cte_inner GROUP BY ss_customer_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT * FROM cte_outer WHERE ss_customer_sk IN (SELECT c_customer_sk FROM customer WHERE c_birth_country = 'UNITED STATES')

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "multi_push_predicate",
      "nodes": {
        "target_customers": "SELECT c_customer_sk FROM customer WHERE c_birth_country = 'UNITED STATES'",
        "cte_inner": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN target_customers ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM cte_inner GROUP BY ss_customer_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.6x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** The customer filter in main_query should be pushed through cte_outer into cte_inner to filter store_sales EARLY. Extract filter to CTE and join at base table.

Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 46.4% cost, 549,054 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 23.8% cost, 549,318 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 549,602 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x15: 34,537,284 → 550,408 rows (filtered)
- reason x1: 55 → 1 rows (filtered)
