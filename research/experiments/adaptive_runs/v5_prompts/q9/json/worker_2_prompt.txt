## Example: Quantity Range Pushdown (QUANTITY_RANGE_PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.11x

### Input:
[quantity_range_1]:
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_quantity) AS qty
FROM store_sales
WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY ss_item_sk

[quantity_range_2]:
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_quantity) AS qty
FROM store_sales
WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 11 AND 20
GROUP BY ss_item_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT i_item_id, q1.qty, q2.qty
FROM quantity_range_1 q1
JOIN quantity_range_2 q2 ON q1.ss_item_sk = q2.ss_item_sk
JOIN item i ON i_item_sk = q1.ss_item_sk
WHERE i_item_id BETWEEN 'A' AND 'Z'
  AND ss_sold_date_sk BETWEEN 2450816 AND 2450846

### Output:

}
```

**Key insight:** When multiple quantity-range branches repeat the same dimensional filters, push those filters into each branch to reduce scan and aggregation cost.

## Example: Decorrelate Subquery (DECORRELATE)
Verified speedup: 2.90x

### Input:
[customer_total_return] CORRELATED:
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 FROM customer_total_return ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk AND s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Push s_state='SD' filter EARLY into first CTE. Compute average as SEPARATE CTE with GROUP BY (NOT window function). Join on average instead of correlated subquery.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 2.71x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_reason": "SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'",
        "filtered_returns": "SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",
        "same result rows"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 46.4% cost, 549,054 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 23.8% cost, 549,318 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 549,602 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x15: 34,537,284 → 550,408 rows (filtered)
- reason x1: 55 → 1 rows (filtered)
