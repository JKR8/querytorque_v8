## Example: Filter Pushdown (PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.44x

### Input:
[inv]:
SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, cov
FROM (SELECT ... FROM inventory JOIN date_dim WHERE d_year = 1998 GROUP BY ...) foo
WHERE stdev/mean > 1

[main_query]:
SELECT ... FROM inv inv1, inv inv2
WHERE inv1.d_moy = 1 AND inv2.d_moy = 2 ...

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "pushdown",
      "nodes": {
        "inv": "SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN NULL ELSE stdev/mean END AS cov FROM (SELECT w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, STDDEV_SAMP(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS stdev, AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS mean FROM inventory JOIN item ON inv_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN warehouse ON inv_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN date_dim ON inv_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE d_year = 1998 AND d_moy IN (1, 2) GROUP BY w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy) foo WHERE mean != 0 AND stdev/mean > 1"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "inv output columns unchanged",
        "main_query unmodified"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.44x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Push d_moy IN (1, 2) from outer query into the CTE's WHERE clause. This filters inventory rows BEFORE aggregation.

## Example: Remove Redundant Operations (REMOVE_REDUNDANT)
Verified speedup: 1.05-1.2x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT DISTINCT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total
FROM customer
JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
GROUP BY c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
ORDER BY c_first_name

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "remove_redundant",
      "nodes": {
        "main_query": "SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM customer JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk GROUP BY c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name ORDER BY c_first_name"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns",
        "same ordering"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.1x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** DISTINCT after GROUP BY on all selected columns is redundant - GROUP BY already produces unique rows. Remove to avoid extra sort/hash.

## Example: Join Reordering (REORDER_JOIN)
Verified speedup: 1.2-1.8x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price)
FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, item
WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND d_year = 2000
  AND s_state = 'TN'
  AND i_category = 'Electronics'

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "reorder_join",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_stores": "SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state = 'TN'",
        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Electronics'",
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price) FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_stores fs ON ss.ss_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension tables FIRST into small CTEs. Join fact table to filtered dimensions. Smaller dimensions reduce fact table scan.

You are a SQL optimizer. Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Only use transforms from the allowlist
- Preserve node contracts (output columns, grain, predicates)
- Coordinate multi-node changes in rewrite_sets
- No formatting-only changes
- No column renames unless required

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, in_to_exists, projection_prune, early_filter, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 46.4% cost, 549,054 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 23.8% cost, 549,318 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 549,602 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 2.2% cost, 550,408 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x15: 34,537,284 → 550,408 rows (filtered)
