Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see two correlated subqueries that are causing performance issues:

1. `d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT (d_month_seq) FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002 AND d_moy = 3)`
2. `i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT AVG(j.i_current_price) FROM item AS j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)`

The execution plan shows these are being evaluated repeatedly. The first subquery returns a single value (month sequence for March 2002), while the second is a correlated subquery that runs for each item row.

Based on the allowed transforms (`decorrelate` is allowed), I'll use a different approach than previous attempts by:
1. Extracting the date filter into a CTE to get the target month sequence
2. Extracting the category average prices into a CTE to avoid repeated correlated subquery execution
3. Pushing these filters earlier in the join sequence

  "explanation": "Decorrelated both subqueries: 1) Extracted the date month sequence lookup into a CTE (target_month) that runs once instead of being a scalar subquery. 2) Extracted category average prices into a CTE (category_avg_prices) that computes all averages once, avoiding repeated correlated subquery execution for each item. Both CTEs are joined early, allowing predicate pushdown and reducing the data volume before expensive joins."
