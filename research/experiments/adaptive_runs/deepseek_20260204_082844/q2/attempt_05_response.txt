  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Pushed the d_year filter from the main query's subqueries into the wswscs CTE before aggregation, reducing the amount of data aggregated. 2) Changed the main query's subqueries from joins to EXISTS semi-joins since only the existence of matching date_dim rows is needed (not additional columns), reducing unnecessary join processing while maintaining the same filtering logic."
