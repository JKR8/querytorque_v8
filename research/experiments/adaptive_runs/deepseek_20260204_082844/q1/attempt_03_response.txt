Looking at the query structure, I can see a correlated subquery in the main query that compares `ctr_total_return` against an average of returns per store. The current execution plan shows this is being computed via a correlated subquery with a LEFT_DELIM_JOIN. This is inefficient because it recomputes the average for each row.

The key insight is that the correlated subquery `WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)` can be decorrelated by pre-computing the store averages once and joining them.

I'll use the `decorrelate` transform to eliminate the correlation and compute store averages in a separate CTE.

  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by creating a CTE 'store_avg_return' that pre-computes the average return per store multiplied by 1.2. This eliminates the correlated execution where the average was recomputed for each row. Instead, we join once with the pre-computed averages, which should significantly reduce computation time."
