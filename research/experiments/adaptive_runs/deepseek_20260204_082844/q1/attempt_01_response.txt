Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see two main optimization opportunities:

1. **Correlated subquery in main_query**: The subquery `(SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)` is correlated and executed for each row of ctr1.
2. **Filter pushdown**: The `s_state = 'SD'` filter is applied late in the join chain, after the CTE has been computed.

The plan shows the correlated subquery creates a LEFT_DELIM_JOIN with a HASH_GROUP_BY inside, which will be executed repeatedly. I can use the `decorrelate` transform to pre-compute the store averages and join them instead.

  "explanation": "Applied two transforms: 1) DECORRELATE to replace the correlated subquery with a CTE that pre-computes store averages, allowing a single join instead of repeated subquery execution. 2) PUSHDOWN to move the s_state='SD' filter into the customer_total_return CTE before aggregation, reducing the number of rows processed in the GROUP BY and subsequent joins."
