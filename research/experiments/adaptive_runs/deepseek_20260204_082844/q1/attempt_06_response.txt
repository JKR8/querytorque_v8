Looking at the query structure and execution plan, I can see several optimization opportunities. The main issue is that the `customer_total_return` CTE computes aggregates for ALL stores and customers from 2000, but the main query only needs results for stores in 'SD' state. This causes unnecessary aggregation work. I'll use **pushdown** to filter early.

**Key insight**: The main query filters `store` on `s_state = 'SD'` and joins with `customer_total_return` on `s_store_sk = ctr_store_sk`. We can push this store filter into the `customer_total_return` CTE to reduce the amount of data processed in the aggregation.

  "explanation": "Pushed the store filter (s_state = 'SD') from the main query into the customer_total_return CTE. This reduces the number of store_returns rows processed in the aggregation from all stores to only stores in SD state. The store_avg_return CTE now only computes averages for SD stores, which is correct since the main query only compares against SD stores. This significantly reduces aggregation work while preserving all invariants."
