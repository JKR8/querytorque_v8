Looking at the query and execution plan, I can identify two optimization opportunities:

1. **OR_TO_UNION**: The query has an OR condition on promotion columns (`p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'`). This can be split into UNION ALL branches.
2. **EARLY_FILTER**: The date_dim filter (`d_year = 2001`) can be pushed into a CTE to reduce the store_sales join early.

The OR condition involves two different columns from the same table (promotion), making it a good candidate for OR_TO_UNION transformation. This will allow each branch to use focused indexes/statistics.

  "explanation": "Transformed OR condition on promotion columns into UNION ALL of two branches: one for p_channel_email = 'N' and one for p_channel_event = 'N'. Extracted date filter into CTE to reduce store_sales join early. Each branch now has a focused predicate that can use promotion table statistics more effectively. The UNION ALL avoids duplicate elimination overhead while preserving correctness since the two conditions are on different columns and rows won't overlap unless both conditions are true (which is handled correctly by UNION ALL)."
