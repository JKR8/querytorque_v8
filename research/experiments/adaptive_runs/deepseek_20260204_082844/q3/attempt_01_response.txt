Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see a clear opportunity for optimization. The query filters `date_dim` on `d_moy = 11` and joins with `store_sales`, but the current plan scans the entire `store_sales` table (2.8M rows) before joining with the filtered `date_dim` (5,620 rows). This is inefficient because we're processing many store_sales rows that won't match any date_dim rows.

The optimization opportunity is to create a filtered CTE for date_dim first, then join it with store_sales early to reduce the number of rows processed in subsequent joins.

  "explanation": "Created a filtered_dates CTE that selects only date_dim rows where d_moy = 11, then joined this early with store_sales to create filtered_sales CTE. This reduces the store_sales rows from ~2.8M to only those matching November dates before joining with item table. The main query then only processes the pre-filtered sales data, avoiding unnecessary processing of sales from other months."
