Looking at the execution plan and detected opportunities, I can see that the main issue is that date filtering happens late in the plan after large UNION operations. The date_dim table is being filtered early, but it's joined after the UNION of store_sales and store_returns (and similarly for catalog and web channels). This means we're processing all sales/returns data before filtering by date.

The key insight from the patterns is that we should push the date filter earlier into the base tables. However, we can't use inline_cte or materialize_cte transforms since they're not in the allowed list. Instead, I'll use **pushdown** to move the date filter earlier in the query.

Looking at the execution plan:
1. For ssr: store_sales and store_returns are UNIONed first, then joined with date_dim
2. For csr: catalog_sales and catalog_returns are UNIONed first, then joined with date_dim  
3. For wsr: web_sales and web_returns are UNIONed first, then joined with date_dim

The optimization opportunity is to push the date filter into each branch of the UNION before the UNION happens. This will significantly reduce the amount of data flowing through the UNION operations.

  "explanation": "Pushed date filter into each branch of the UNION before UNION operation. For ssr: store_sales and store_returns now join with date_dim early to filter by date range before UNION. For csr: catalog_sales and catalog_returns now join with date_dim early to filter by date range before UNION. This reduces the amount of data flowing through UNION operations by filtering at the source tables. The wsr CTE already has a similar structure but with a LEFT OUTER JOIN in the web_returns branch, so it's left unchanged to maintain correctness."
}
```

**Key insight:** The date filter `d_date BETWEEN '2000-08-19' AND ('2000-08-19' + INTERVAL '14' DAY)` should be applied as early as possible. By pushing it into each branch of the UNION before the UNION happens, we filter out irrelevant rows from store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales, and catalog_returns before they enter the UNION operations. This reduces the data volume significantly and should provide better than the current 1.04x speedup.
