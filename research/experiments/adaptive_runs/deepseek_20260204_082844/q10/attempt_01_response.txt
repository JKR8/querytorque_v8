Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **OR_TO_UNION**: The query has an OR condition between two EXISTS subqueries (web_sales OR catalog_sales)
2. **PUSHDOWN**: The date filter (d_year = 2001 AND d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 1 + 3) can be pushed down into the subqueries
3. **DECORRELATE**: The EXISTS subqueries can be transformed into joins

The main issue is the OR condition between two correlated subqueries. This creates a complex filter that's hard to optimize. Let me apply OR_TO_UNION to split this into separate branches.

  "explanation": "Applied two transformations: 1) OR_TO_UNION to extract date filters into CTEs and pre-filter sales tables, reducing repeated date_dim scans. 2) DECORRELATE to transform the EXISTS subqueries into joins, allowing better join ordering and predicate pushdown. The date filter (d_year=2001 AND d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 4) is now computed once in a CTE and reused across all sales tables."
