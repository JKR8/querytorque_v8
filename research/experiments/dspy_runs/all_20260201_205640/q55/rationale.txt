The optimization restructures the query to filter the smaller tables (`date_dim` and `item`) first using subqueries, reducing the rows joined with `store_sales`. This minimizes the dominant cost of the sequential scan on `store_sales` by applying join conditions early, potentially leveraging indexes on `ss_sold_date_sk` and `ss_item_sk`. The semantics remain identical, as the joins and filters are unchanged. This approach encourages the query planner to process filtered results first, improving performance by reducing intermediate row counts and I/O operations.
