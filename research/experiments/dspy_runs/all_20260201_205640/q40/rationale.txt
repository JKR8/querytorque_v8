1. **Early filtering with date_dim**: By joining catalog_sales with date_dim first and applying the date range filter immediately, we reduce the catalog_sales rows from 27,334 to only those within the 61-day window early in the execution, lowering the cost of subsequent joins.
2. **Early filtering with item**: The item price filter is applied directly in the JOIN condition with the pre-filtered catalog_sales, reducing the rows before the expensive LEFT JOIN with catalog_returns.
3. **Reduced JOIN complexity**: The original query performed a LEFT JOIN between catalog_sales and catalog_returns before other filters, processing all 144,001 catalog_returns rows. Now, the LEFT JOIN happens after catalog_sales and item are filtered, significantly reducing the rows involved.
4. **Simplified date casting**: Changed `cast(d_date as date)` to `d_date` assuming d_date is of DATE type (or cast once in subquery), reducing per-row computation in CASE expressions.
5. **Maintained semantics**: The query still returns the same results—summing sales before and after 2001-04-02, with LEFT JOIN preserving all catalog_sales rows even without matching returns.

These changes should lower the overall cost by reducing the rows processed in high-cost sequential scans and joins, as indicated by the execution plan where catalog_sales and catalog_returns scans are the most expensive operations.
