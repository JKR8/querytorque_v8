1. **Changed to explicit JOIN syntax**: This gives the query optimizer clearer intent and potentially better control over join order execution.

2. **Optimized join order**: By placing the most restrictive filters first in the join sequence, we reduce the working set early:
   - `date_dim` filtered by `d_year = 2001` reduces to 365 rows
   - `customer_demographics` filtered by gender, marital status, and education reduces to 27,440 rows
   - `promotion` filtered by channel conditions reduces the 1,000 rows further
   - These filtered results then join with `store_sales`, reducing the 546,063 row scan

3. **Early filtering**: The WHERE conditions are applied as early as possible in the join sequence rather than after all joins complete, reducing intermediate result sizes.

4. **Maintained semantics**: The query returns identical results with the same grouping and ordering, just with potentially more efficient execution.

5. **Potential for dynamic filtering**: The execution plan mentions "Dynamic Filter (i_item_id)" on the item table, which suggests the optimizer may push down filters. The explicit JOIN syntax may help the optimizer better utilize this feature.

The optimization aims to reduce the 88.3% cost of the store_sales sequential scan by filtering it through smaller, pre-filtered dimension tables earlier in the execution.
