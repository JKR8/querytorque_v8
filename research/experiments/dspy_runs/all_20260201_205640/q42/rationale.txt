1. **Explicit JOIN syntax**: Changed implicit joins (comma-separated) to explicit JOINs for better readability and standard practice, though this doesn't directly affect performance.
2. **Filter placement**: Moved all WHERE conditions directly after the relevant table joins to ensure the optimizer applies filters as early as possible. The date_dim filter reduces it to 30 rows, and item filter reduces it to 3,648 rows before joining with store_sales.
3. **Join order optimization**: By filtering date_dim and item first, the database can use these smaller result sets to probe the store_sales table more efficiently, potentially using index lookups if available on ss_sold_date_sk and ss_item_sk, rather than scanning all 87,965 store_sales rows.
4. **Semantic preservation**: The query logic remains identical - it still joins the same tables with the same conditions, groups by the same columns, orders by the same criteria, and limits to 100 rows.

This optimization reduces the intermediate row count during joins, which should lower I/O and memory usage, making the hash joins more efficient. The most expensive sequential scan on store_sales may now be avoided or reduced through better join strategies.
