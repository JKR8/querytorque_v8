[After 3 attempts] Used a different strategy: pre-filtering with CTEs to reduce large table scans. Created filtered_date CTE to reuse date_dim filter (120 rows). Created filtered sales CTEs with DISTINCT customer keys to reduce duplicates before EXISTS checks. Filtered customer_address early by county to reduce join size. Kept original EXISTS logic to preserve correct semantics (store_sales AND (web_sales OR catalog_sales)). This avoids the LEFT JOIN pitfall and reduces work by pre-aggregating sales tables once instead of scanning them multiple times per customer.
