1. **Changed implicit joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax**: This makes the query structure clearer and allows the optimizer to better understand join relationships.
2. **Removed unnecessary ORDER BY**: Since we're selecting a single COUNT(*) value with LIMIT 100, the ORDER BY serves no purpose and would force a sort operation.
3. **Maintained all filter conditions in WHERE clause**: The filters on time_dim, household_demographics, and store are applied early in the execution, reducing the number of rows that need to be joined with store_sales.
4. **Preserved identical semantics**: The query still returns the same count of store_sales records that match all the specified conditions.
5. **Expected performance improvement**: By eliminating the sort operation and using explicit joins, the query should execute faster while processing fewer intermediate rows, particularly reducing the impact of the large store_sales table scan.
