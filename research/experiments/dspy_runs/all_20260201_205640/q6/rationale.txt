1. **Eliminated duplicate date_dim subquery**: Created a CTE (date_filter) to compute the d_month_seq once, avoiding redundant execution of the same subquery.

2. **Converted correlated subquery to join**: Created item_avg_price CTE to pre-compute average prices per category, transforming the expensive correlated subquery into an efficient join operation.

3. **Improved join order**: Started with the smallest filtered tables (date_dim with 31 rows after filtering) and store_sales (25,884 rows), reducing intermediate result sizes early in the execution.

4. **Used CTEs for readability and performance**: Common Table Expressions allow the optimizer to materialize intermediate results and choose better execution plans.

5. **Maintained semantic equivalence**: All original conditions are preserved - same joins, same filters, same grouping, same ordering, same limit.

These optimizations should significantly reduce execution time by:
- Avoiding repeated subquery execution
- Reducing correlated subquery overhead
- Minimizing intermediate result sizes through better join ordering
- Leveraging set-based operations instead of row-by-row processing
