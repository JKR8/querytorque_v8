1. **Join Reordering**: Changed to explicit JOIN syntax starting with `date_dim`, which is heavily filtered (365 rows), to reduce the rows early in the join sequence, potentially lowering the cost of subsequent joins with `store_sales`.
2. **Predicate Simplification**: Used `BETWEEN` for `d_month_seq` for clarity and potential index utilization, and included `s_store_sk <= 400` explicitly to leverage the filter on `store`.
3. **Condition Structure**: Kept the complex OR condition on `item` as is, but ensured it's applied directly in the WHERE clause to allow predicate pushdown if supported by the database optimizer.
4. **Maintained Semantics**: All original logic, including the window function and outer filter, is preserved. The changes aim to improve execution plan by reducing intermediate row counts through early filtering and clearer join paths, which should lower the overall cost, especially the sequential scan on `store_sales`.
