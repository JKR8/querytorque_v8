1. **Explicit JOIN syntax**: Using explicit JOINs (INNER JOIN) instead of comma-separated tables makes the query more readable and can help the optimizer understand join relationships better.

2. **Filter placement**: All WHERE conditions are placed together at the end, which is semantically identical but can help the optimizer apply filters earlier in the execution plan.

3. **Join order optimization**: While the explicit syntax doesn't force a specific join order, it allows the optimizer to potentially reorder joins more effectively. The optimizer can now see that date_dim (365 filtered rows) and customer_demographics (filtered to specific criteria) should be joined early to reduce the store_sales rows processed.

4. **Reduced intermediate result size**: By filtering date_dim to only 2001 dates (365 rows) and customer_demographics to specific criteria before joining with store_sales, we reduce the number of rows that need to be processed in the most expensive operation.

5. **Maintained semantics**: The optimized query returns identical results to the original query while potentially executing faster due to better optimization opportunities for the query planner.
