  "semantic_warnings": ["Changed correlated subquery to window function for better performance"],
  "explanation": "1. Replaced correlated subquery with window function to compute store average once per partition instead of for each row. 2. Added explicit JOIN syntax for clarity. 3. Removed redundant date_dim scan in main query by computing average in CTE. Note: Did NOT push store filter into CTE like Kimi did - that's why it's slower.",
  "comparison": "Kimi K2.5 achieved 2.44x on full DB by also pushing s_state='SD' into CTE. DeepSeek V3 only got 1.10x by keeping store filter in main query."
