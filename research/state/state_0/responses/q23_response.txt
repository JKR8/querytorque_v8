  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filters into reusable CTEs: (1) date_filter_years for years 2000-2003 used in frequent_ss_items and max_store_sales, (2) date_filter_month for year=2000, month=5 used in catalog/web sales. Pre-joined fact tables with date CTEs to reduce join cardinality early. Decorrelated IN subqueries by converting to explicit joins with the CTEs, enabling better join ordering and reducing repeated scans."
