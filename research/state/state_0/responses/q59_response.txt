Looking at this query pattern, I see an opportunity to apply **date_cte_isolate** transform. The main query filters date_dim by `d_month_seq` ranges in two subqueries, but the CTE `wss` scans the entire store_sales table without these filters. By pushing the date filters into the CTE using two separate CTEs for each date range, we can dramatically reduce the data processed in the aggregations.

  "explanation": "Replaced the single unfiltered wss CTE with two filtered CTEs (wss_range1 and wss_range2) that incorporate the d_month_seq filters from the main query. This reduces the store_sales scan from 345M rows to approximately the rows matching each 12-month range, significantly reducing aggregation cost while preserving exact semantics. The main query now joins directly with these pre-filtered, pre-aggregated CTEs."
