Looking at this query, I see an opportunity to apply the **prefetch_fact_join** transform pattern. The current execution plan shows store_sales being scanned completely (345M rows) before any filtering. We can create CTEs that filter the dimension tables first, then join with store_sales to reduce the fact table scan.

The key insight: Filter date_dim (d_moy = 11) and item (i_manufact_id = 816) first, then join with store_sales.

  "explanation": "Applied prefetch_fact_join transform: Created CTEs to filter date_dim (d_moy = 11) and item (i_manufact_id = 816) first, then joined these filtered dimension tables with store_sales. This reduces the fact table scan from 345M rows to only those rows matching the filtered dimensions. The main query then aggregates the pre-filtered sales data. All literals are preserved exactly as in the original query (d_moy = 11, i_manufact_id = 816)."
