  "explanation": "Applied three transformations: 1) DECORRELATE: Extracted the correlated subquery into a separate CTE (state_avg_return) that computes the average per state once, then joined instead of correlated lookup. 2) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE: Created filtered_dates CTE to isolate date filtering early, reducing the size of catalog_returns join. 3) PUSHDOWN: Pushed the date filter (d_year=2002) and fact table scan into filtered_catalog_returns CTE before grouping. This reduces the amount of data processed in the expensive grouping operation."
