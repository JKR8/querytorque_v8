  "explanation": "Materialized the repeated subquery pattern (sa and sc) into a single CTE (store_item_revenue) to avoid duplicate computation. Also isolated date_dim filter into a CTE (filtered_dates) to reduce fact table join size. The store_avg_revenue CTE computes store averages from the materialized revenue data. This reduces store_sales scans from 2 to 1 and applies date filter early."
