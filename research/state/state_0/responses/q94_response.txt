  "explanation": "This rewrite applies multiple optimizations: (1) Isolates date filtering into a CTE to reduce fact table scanning early. (2) Materializes the multi-warehouse condition as a CTE using GROUP BY/HAVING instead of correlated subquery. (3) Materializes returned orders as a CTE. (4) Transforms EXISTS/NOT EXISTS into joins. The main query now joins with pre-computed CTEs, avoiding repeated scans of web_sales and web_returns. This pattern matches the verified 'materialize_cte' approach from the examples."
