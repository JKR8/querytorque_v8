  "explanation": "Applied Date CTE Isolation pattern: Created filtered_dates CTE with only 1998-1999 years to drastically reduce fact table joins. Each fact table (catalog_sales, store_sales, web_sales) is pre-filtered through filtered_dates CTE before joining with other dimension tables. This reduces the large fact table scans from full table to only 2 years of data. Also simplified main_query by removing the date arithmetic (1999-1) and using literal 1998 for clarity while preserving exact semantics."
