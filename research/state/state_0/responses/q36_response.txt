  "explanation": "Applied prefetch_fact_join pattern by creating two dimension CTEs (filtered_dates, filtered_stores) that are joined early with the fact table store_sales. This reduces the fact table from 5.4M rows to only the rows matching filtered dates (year=2002) and stores (8 states). The resulting filtered_sales CTE then joins with item for aggregation. This avoids scanning the entire store_sales table and applies dimension filters early."
