  "explanation": "Created filtered CTEs for date_dim, store, and household_demographics to reduce the cardinality of the fact table join early. This follows the multi_dimension_prefetch pattern where multiple dimension tables with selective filters are isolated before joining with the large fact table. The original OR condition on household_demographics is preserved as-is (not converted to UNION ALL) based on the OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint. All literals are preserved exactly as in the original query."
