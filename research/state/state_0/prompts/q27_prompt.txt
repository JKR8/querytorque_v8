## Example: Dimension CTE Isolation (DIMENSION_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 1.93x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT i_item_id, avg(cs_quantity) agg1, avg(cs_list_price) agg2, avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(cs_sales_price) agg4
FROM catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
  AND cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
  AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100

```

**Key insight:** Pre-filter EACH dimension table into its own CTE returning only the surrogate key. This reduces the cardinality of subsequent joins. Works best when dimension filters are highly selective.

## Example: Multi Dimension Prefetch (MULTI_DIMENSION_PREFETCH)
Verified speedup: 2.71x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) sun_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) mon_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) tue_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) wed_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) thu_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) fri_sales,

WHERE d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk AND s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
  AND s_gmt_offset = -5 AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id
ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales
LIMIT 100

### Output:

      },

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Pre-filter BOTH date_dim AND store into separate CTEs. Include only the columns needed for the join and grouping. The optimizer can then use these smaller CTEs efficiently when joining with the fact table.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_reason": "SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'",
        "filtered_returns": "SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",
        "same result rows"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:
