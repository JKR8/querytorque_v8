  "explanation": "Pre-filtered both dimension tables (date_dim and item) into separate CTEs before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the fact table join from scanning all 345M rows to only rows matching the filtered dimensions. The date_dim CTE returns 31 rows (December 2002), and the item CTE returns 1,847 rows (manager_id=1). The fact table join now only processes rows that match both filtered sets, dramatically reducing I/O and hash join cost."
