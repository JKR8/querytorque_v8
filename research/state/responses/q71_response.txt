Looking at this query, I can see two main opportunities: **date_cte_isolate** and **early filtering of dimension tables**. The query has three UNION ALL branches each joining with date_dim using the same filter (d_moy=12 AND d_year=1998). Currently date_dim is scanned three times - we can isolate it into a CTE. Also, we can filter item and time_dim early before the expensive joins.

However, I need to be careful with the OR condition on t_meal_time. Based on the constraints, I should NOT split this OR into UNION ALL since it's a single column OR with only 2 values - DuckDB handles this efficiently.

Let me apply date_cte_isolate to avoid scanning date_dim three times:

  ],
  "explanation": "1. Isolated date_dim filter into CTE (filtered_dates) to scan date_dim only once instead of three times. 2. Filtered item and time_dim early into CTEs (filtered_items, filtered_time) to reduce join cardinality before expensive fact table joins. 3. Preserved the OR condition on t_meal_time as-is (single column OR with 2 values, DuckDB handles efficiently). 4. All literals preserved exactly from original query."
