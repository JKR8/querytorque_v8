  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered dates and customer addresses to reduce join cardinality early. Each sales CTE now joins with these pre-filtered dimension tables, significantly reducing the number of rows processed in the main joins. The item category filter was moved from a subquery to a direct WHERE clause while preserving semantics. This follows the multi_dimension_prefetch pattern demonstrated in the examples."
