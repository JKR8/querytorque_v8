  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filtering into CTE, then pre-joined with store_sales to create a smaller intermediate fact table. This reduces the number of rows before joining with item and store. The OR condition is preserved exactly as in the original query to avoid over-expansion. This follows the prefetch_fact_join pattern which showed 3.77x speedup in similar queries."
