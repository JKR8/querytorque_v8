  "explanation": "Applied multi_dimension_prefetch: isolated date_dim, store, and household_demographics into separate CTEs with their filters applied early. This allows the large store_sales fact table to be joined with pre-filtered dimension subsets, reducing join cardinality before aggregation. The OR condition on household_demographics is preserved in its CTE (as per OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint)."
