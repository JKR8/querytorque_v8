Looking at this query structure, I can see multiple optimization opportunities. The key insight is that we have three CTEs (ws, ss, cs - though cs isn't defined here) that all join with date_dim, and the main query filters on `ss_sold_year = 2000`. We should push this filter down into the CTEs and isolate date filtering early.

Here's my rewrite plan:

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_dates_2000": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",

        "ss_rewritten": "SELECT 2000 AS ss_sold_year, ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk, SUM(ss_quantity) AS ss_qty, SUM(ss_wholesale_cost) AS ss_wc, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS ss_sp FROM store_sales LEFT JOIN store_returns ON sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk JOIN filtered_dates_2000 ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE sr_ticket_number IS NULL GROUP BY ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk",
        "main_query_rewritten": "SELECT ss_item_sk, ROUND(ss_qty / (COALESCE(ws_qty, 0) + COALESCE(cs_qty, 0)), 2) AS ratio, ss_qty AS store_qty, ss_wc AS store_wholesale_cost, ss_sp AS store_sales_price, COALESCE(ws_qty, 0) + COALESCE(cs_qty, 0) AS other_chan_qty, COALESCE(ws_wc, 0) + COALESCE(cs_wc, 0) AS other_chan_wholesale_cost, COALESCE(ws_sp, 0) + COALESCE(cs_sp, 0) AS other_chan_sales_price FROM ss_rewritten ss LEFT JOIN ws_rewritten ws ON (ws.ws_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND ws.ws_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk) LEFT JOIN cs ON (cs.cs_sold_year = 2000 AND cs.cs_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND cs.cs_customer_sk = ss.ss_customer_sk) WHERE (COALESCE(ws_qty, 0) > 0 OR COALESCE(cs_qty, 0) > 0) ORDER BY ss_item_sk, ss_qty DESC, ss_wc DESC, ss_sp DESC, other_chan_qty, other_chan_wholesale_cost, other_chan_sales_price, ratio LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same column output",
        "same grouping and aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "The main optimization is date_cte_isolate: created a CTE 'filtered_dates_2000' that filters date_dim to only year 2000 rows early. This reduces the date_dim scan from 73,049 rows to ~365 rows (366 days in 2000). Then pushed this filter into the ws and ss CTEs, eliminating the need for d_year in GROUP BY since we know all rows are year 2000. Also removed the redundant 'ss_sold_year = 2000' filter from main query since the rewritten ss CTE only returns 2000 data. This reduces join cardinalities and aggregation costs significantly."
