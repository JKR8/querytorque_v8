Looking at this query pattern, I can apply **prefetch_fact_join** transform since:
1. The main query has a large web_sales fact table scan (92.5% cost, 86M rows)
2. We have small filtered dimensions (date_dim: 31 rows, item: 102K rows)
3. Currently it's scanning ALL web_sales rows then filtering with joins

The strategy: pre-join web_sales with the filtered_dates CTE first to create a smaller intermediate result BEFORE joining with filtered_items.

  "explanation": "Created filtered_sales CTE by pre-joining web_sales with filtered_dates. This reduces the fact table rows from 86M to only those in the date range before joining with items. The filtered_sales CTE contains only 68K rows (as shown in execution plan) instead of scanning the entire web_sales table, dramatically reducing I/O and join cost."
