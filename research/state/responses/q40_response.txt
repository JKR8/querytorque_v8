Looking at this query, I can see a clear opportunity for **multi-dimension prefetch** with an additional **early filter** pattern. The query has two dimension tables (date_dim and item) with filters that can be isolated before joining with the large fact table (catalog_sales).

        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id FROM item WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49",

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "3.0x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Created CTEs to pre-filter date_dim (61 rows) and item (6,464 rows) based on their respective filters before joining with the large fact table catalog_sales (172M rows). This reduces the initial join size dramatically. The LEFT OUTER JOIN with catalog_returns is preserved exactly as in the original query. All literal values are preserved exactly per LITERAL_PRESERVATION constraint."
}
```

**Key insight**: The execution plan shows that date_dim filters to 61 rows and item filters to 6,464 rows from their respective base tables. By creating these as CTEs first, we can reduce the catalog_sales join from scanning 172M rows to joining with only the relevant filtered dimensions. This should dramatically reduce the hash join sizes and intermediate results, similar to the PREFETCH_FACT_JOIN pattern in the examples but applied to multiple dimensions.
