  "explanation": "Pre-filtered date_dim and item tables into separate CTEs using their selective predicates (d_moy=12, d_year=1999 and i_manager_id=2). Created a prejoined_facts CTE that joins store_sales with both filtered dimensions early, reducing the fact table rows from 345M to ~933K before joining with the remaining low-selectivity dimensions (customer, customer_address, store). This avoids scanning the entire store_sales table multiple times and reduces intermediate join cardinality."
