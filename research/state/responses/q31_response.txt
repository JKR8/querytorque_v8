  "explanation": "Created a filtered_dates CTE that isolates date_dim filtering for d_year=2000 and d_qoy IN (1,2,3). Rewrote the ss and ws CTEs to join with this filtered_dates CTE early, reducing the fact table joins from full scans to filtered scans. This leverages the date_cte_isolate pattern to apply date filters before joining with large fact tables, dramatically reducing the amount of data processed in the aggregations."
