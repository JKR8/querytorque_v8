Looking at this query, I see a clear opportunity for the **prefetch_fact_join** pattern similar to the first example. The query filters date_dim (d_moy=12, d_year=2000) and item (i_manager_id=100), both of which reduce to small result sets (31 and 317 rows respectively), but currently scans the entire store_sales table (345M rows) before filtering.

The execution plan shows store_sales as 98.4% of the cost with no filter - a classic case for prefetching.

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Applied prefetch_fact_join pattern by first filtering dimension tables (date_dim to 31 rows, item to 317 rows) into CTEs, then joining them with store_sales. This creates a smaller intermediate result (filtered_sales) that only contains store_sales rows matching the date filter, before joining with filtered items. This avoids scanning the entire 345M row store_sales table and reduces it to only rows from December 2000 that also match the manager_id=100 items. The pattern is similar to the verified 3.77x speedup example."
