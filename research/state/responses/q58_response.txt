  "explanation": "Extracted the repeated date subquery (finding week of '2001-03-24') into a common CTE (week_dates). This allows the date_dim scan to happen once instead of 9 times. Rewrote ss_items, ws_items, and inferred cs_items to join with this CTE instead of using correlated subqueries. This eliminates redundant scans of date_dim and reduces the query's complexity while maintaining exact semantic equivalence."
