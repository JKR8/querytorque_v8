  "explanation": "Isolate the date_dim filter into a CTE to create a pre-filtered set of date keys. Join this with web_sales early to dramatically reduce the fact table rows (from 86M to ~200K as seen in execution plan). This allows subsequent joins with customer, customer_address, and item to operate on much smaller intermediate results. The OR condition and IN subquery remain unchanged to avoid the OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT constraint while preserving literal values exactly."
