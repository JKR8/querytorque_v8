You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

RULES:
- Maximize execution speed while preserving semantic invariants (output columns, grain, total result rows).
- Group dependent changes into a single rewrite_set.
- Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` not `cte1`).
- If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not in the allowed list, label it "semantic_rewrite".

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Query Structure

### Target Nodes
[main_query] GROUP_BY

### SQL
[main_query] type=main
```sql
SELECT dt.d_year, item.i_brand_id AS brand_id, item.i_brand AS brand, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg FROM date_dim AS dt, store_sales, item WHERE dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk AND item.i_manufact_id = 816 AND dt.d_moy = 11 GROUP BY dt.d_year, item.i_brand, item.i_brand_id ORDER BY dt.d_year, sum_agg DESC, brand_id LIMIT 100
```

### Contracts
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['d_year', 'brand_id', 'brand', 'sum_agg']
  grain: ['d_year', 'i_brand', 'i_brand_id']
  required_predicates: ['dt.d_moy = 11', 'item.i_manufact_id = 816', 'dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk']

## Performance Profile

### Cost Attribution
[main_query]: 100.0% cost, ~22600422 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]]

### Execution Plan
```
Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 97.9% cost, 22,600,422 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 1.7% cost, 6,102 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 0.2% cost, 25 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 0.1% cost, 67 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(store_sales): 0.1% cost, 6,000 rows

Scans:
- store_sales x1: 345,611,892 rows (no filter)
- item x1: 102,000 → 25 rows (filtered)
- date_dim x1: 73,049 → 6,000 rows (filtered)

Misestimates:
- PROJECTION: est 1,913 vs actual 67 (28.6x)
- PROJECTION: est 1,913 vs actual 67 (28.6x)
- HASH_GROUP_BY: est 1,913 vs actual 67 (28.6x)
- FILTER: est 5,620 vs actual 150 (37.5x)

Joins:
- HASH_JOIN: ? x ? -> 1,211 rows
- HASH_JOIN: store_sales x item -> 6,102 rows (late)
```

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:

## Previous Attempts

- baseline: 1.00x [none] NEUTRAL
- kimi: 0.98x [none] NEUTRAL
- dsr1: 1.04x [prefetch_fact_join] NEUTRAL

**No effect**: prefetch_fact_join

**Recommended patterns** (details in Examples section below):
- **date_cte_isolate** (4.00x) — Extract date filtering into a separate CTE to enable predicate pushdown and reduce scans.
- **early_filter** (4.00x) — Filter dimension tables FIRST, then join to fact tables to reduce expensive joins.
- **multi_dimension_prefetch** (2.71x) — Pre-filter multiple dimension tables (date + store) into separate CTEs before joining with fact table.

## Examples (Verified Patterns)

## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json

        "same result rows",

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.0x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

**When NOT to use:** Do not use when the optimizer already pushes date predicates effectively (e.g., simple equality filters on date columns in self-joins). Do not decompose an already-efficient existing CTE into sub-CTEs — this adds materialization overhead without reducing scans. Caused 0.49x regression on Q31 (DuckDB already optimized the date pushdown) and 0.71x on Q1 (decomposed a well-structured CTE into slower pieces).

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:

    {

      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

## Example: Multi Dimension Prefetch (MULTI_DIMENSION_PREFETCH)
Verified speedup: 2.71x

### Input:

  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) mon_sales,

  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) fri_sales,
  sum(CASE WHEN (d_day_name='Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) sat_sales
FROM date_dim, store_sales, store
WHERE d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk AND s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
  AND s_gmt_offset = -5 AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id
ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales
LIMIT 100

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Pre-filter BOTH date_dim AND store into separate CTEs. Include only the columns needed for the join and grouping. The optimizer can then use these smaller CTEs efficiently when joining with the fact table.

**When NOT to use:** Do not create dimension CTEs without a WHERE clause that actually reduces rows — an unfiltered dimension CTE is pure overhead (full scan + materialization for zero selectivity benefit). Avoid on queries with 5+ tables and complex inter-table predicates where forcing join order via CTEs prevents the optimizer from choosing a better plan. Caused 0.85x on Q67 (unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead) and 0.77x on Q72 (forced suboptimal join ordering on complex multi-table query).

## Constraints

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION** [CRITICAL]: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD** [HIGH]: If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE** [HIGH]: Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD** [HIGH]: Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES** [HIGH]: When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS** [CRITICAL]: Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.
