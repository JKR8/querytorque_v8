## Example: Single Pass Aggregation (SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION)
Verified speedup: 4.47x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT
  CASE WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) > 74129
       THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20)
       ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
  CASE WHEN (SELECT count(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 122840
       THEN (SELECT avg(ss_ext_discount_amt) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40)
       ELSE (SELECT avg(ss_net_paid) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) END AS bucket2,
  -- ... 3 more buckets, 15 total scans of store_sales

**Key insight:** Multiple scalar subqueries with different filter conditions on the same table can be consolidated into a single CTE using conditional CASE expressions inside aggregates. Reduces N scans to 1 scan.

## Example: Filter Pushdown (PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.11x

### Input:

  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
  CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 4505785
  THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40)
  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) END AS bucket2

```

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

## CONSTRAINTS (Learned from Benchmark Failures)

The following constraints are MANDATORY based on observed failures:

### LITERAL_PRESERVATION [CRITICAL]
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

### OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT [HIGH]
CAUTION with OR→UNION: Only split OR conditions into UNION ALL when there are ≤3 simple branches AND they have different access patterns. If you have nested ORs (e.g., 3 conditions × 3 values = 9 combinations), DO NOT expand them - keep the original OR structure. DuckDB handles OR predicates efficiently. Over-splitting causes multiple scans of fact tables and severe regressions (0.23x-0.41x observed). When in doubt, preserve the original OR structure.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite
