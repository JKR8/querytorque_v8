## Example (different query, shows the format)
For a query: "SELECT c_name FROM customer, store WHERE c_store_sk = s_store_sk AND s_state = 'TX' AND c_age > (SELECT avg(c_age)*1.2 FROM customer c2 WHERE c2.c_store_sk = c.c_store_sk)"

{"reasoning": "Need 2+ customers at same store. avg age = (50+20)/2=35, 1.2*35=42. Customer with age 50>42 qualifies. Second store: avg=(60+25)/2=42.5, 1.2*42.5=51. Customer 60>51 qualifies.", "tables": {"store": {"columns": ["s_store_sk", "s_state"], "rows": [[1000, "TX"], [1001, "TX"]]}, "customer": {"columns": ["c_customer_sk", "c_name", "c_store_sk", "c_age"], "rows": [[2000, "Alice", 1000, 50], [2001, "Bob", 1000, 20], [2002, "Carol", 1001, 60], [2003, "Dan", 1001, 25]]}}}

## Rules
1. Include ONLY the columns listed in COLUMNS NEEDED above.
2. Every _sk join must have matching rows on both sides.
3. For correlated aggregate comparisons (value > avg*1.2): you need 2+ rows per group.
   The "winner" row's value must exceed 1.2x the group average (which includes that row).
   SHOW THE MATH in reasoning.
4. Denominators in division must be > 0.
5. String values are case-sensitive: use exact values from FILTERS.
6. Use integer keys starting at 1000.
7. Dates as strings: "2002-06-15".
8. null for columns you don't care about.
