## Query analysis (pre-computed)
TABLES:
  customer
  customer_address
  customer_demographics
  household_demographics
  income_band
  store_returns

JOINS:
  store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
  household_demographics.hd_demo_sk = customer.c_current_hdemo_sk
  customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk = customer.c_current_cdemo_sk
  income_band.ib_income_band_sk = household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk
  customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk

FILTERS:
  income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 23567 + 50000
  income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 23567
  customer_address.ca_city = 'Jackson'

COLUMNS NEEDED (table.column : type):
  customer: c_current_addr_sk (INTEGER), c_current_cdemo_sk (INTEGER), c_current_hdemo_sk (INTEGER), c_customer_id (VARCHAR), c_first_name (VARCHAR), c_last_name (VARCHAR)
  customer_address: ca_address_sk (INTEGER), ca_city (VARCHAR)
  customer_demographics: cd_demo_sk (INTEGER)

  income_band: ib_income_band_sk (INTEGER), ib_lower_bound (INTEGER), ib_upper_bound (INTEGER)
  store_returns: sr_cdemo_sk (INTEGER)

## SQL (for reference)

## Example (different query, shows the format)
For a query: "SELECT c_name FROM customer, store WHERE c_store_sk = s_store_sk AND s_state = 'TX' AND c_age > (SELECT avg(c_age)*1.2 FROM customer c2 WHERE c2.c_store_sk = c.c_store_sk)"

{"reasoning": "Need 2+ customers at same store. avg age = (50+20)/2=35, 1.2*35=42. Customer with age 50>42 qualifies. Second store: avg=(60+25)/2=42.5, 1.2*42.5=51. Customer 60>51 qualifies.", "tables": {"store": {"columns": ["s_store_sk", "s_state"], "rows": [[1000, "TX"], [1001, "TX"]]}, "customer": {"columns": ["c_customer_sk", "c_name", "c_store_sk", "c_age"], "rows": [[2000, "Alice", 1000, 50], [2001, "Bob", 1000, 20], [2002, "Carol", 1001, 60], [2003, "Dan", 1001, 25]]}}}

## Rules
1. Include ONLY the columns listed in COLUMNS NEEDED above.
2. Every _sk join must have matching rows on both sides.
3. For correlated aggregate comparisons (value > avg*1.2): you need 2+ rows per group.
   The "winner" row's value must exceed 1.2x the group average (which includes that row).
   SHOW THE MATH in reasoning.
4. Denominators in division must be > 0.
5. String values are case-sensitive: use exact values from FILTERS.
6. Use integer keys starting at 1000.
7. Dates as strings: "2002-06-15".
8. null for columns you don't care about.
