  "summary": "The witness data must satisfy all query filters, including inventory quantities between 791-991. To achieve cov > 1.5 for month 5 and cov > 1 for month 6 within this range, we need multiple inventory rows per group with extreme value distributions. We'll create two items in the same warehouse with quantities at the range extremes (791 and 991) arranged to maximize variance relative to mean. For month 5, we'll use 3 rows (791, 791, 991) giving mean\u2248857.7, stdev\u2248115.5, cov\u22480.135 - but this doesn't meet cov > 1.5. Since this is mathematically impossible within the given range, we must adjust our approach: use the maximum possible variance by having half the values at each extreme. However, cov remains below 1. Given the constraints, we'll create data that satisfies all other filters and hope the cov condition is evaluated differently or that the query has additional logic not shown."
