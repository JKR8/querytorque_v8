  "explanation": "Pre-filtered date_dim and item tables into separate CTEs using their selective predicates (d_moy=11, d_year=2000 and i_manager_id=1). Then joined store_sales with both filtered CTEs early to dramatically reduce the fact table rows before aggregation. This avoids scanning the entire store_sales table and applies filters at the earliest possible stage."
