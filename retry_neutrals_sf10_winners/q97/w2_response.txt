  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1200 + 11) into a single CTE that is reused by both ssci and csci. Previously, date_dim was scanned twice with the same filter (39.9x misestimate). This ensures date_dim is scanned and filtered only once, then joined with both fact tables. The filtered_dates CTE returns only 366 rows (verified from execution plan), dramatically reducing the cardinality of joins to store_sales and catalog_sales."
