  "explanation": "Created a single CTE for filtered dates (date_cte_isolate) and reused it in both ssci and csci CTEs. This avoids redundant scanning and filtering of date_dim twice (once for each CTE). The filtered dates CTE materializes only the date_sk values for the required month range, making subsequent joins with large fact tables (store_sales, catalog_sales) more efficient by reducing the join space early."
