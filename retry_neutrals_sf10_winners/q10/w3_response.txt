  "explanation": "Transformed OR condition on EXISTS subqueries into UNION-like structure using LEFT JOINs. Created materialized CTEs for each sales channel with filtered date_dim to avoid repeated scanning. Replaced correlated subqueries with precomputed sets of customer keys that meet each condition. This eliminates repeated scanning of large fact tables (store_sales, web_sales, catalog_sales) and reduces the OR evaluation to simple NULL checks."
