  "explanation": "Created a single date CTE for the common date filter (2001, months 4-6) used across three subqueries. Then pre-joined this CTE with each fact table to extract distinct customer keys, reducing repeated date_dim scans and early fact table filtering. The EXISTS/NOT EXISTS conditions now operate against these pre-filtered CTEs, eliminating correlated date_dim joins in each subquery."
