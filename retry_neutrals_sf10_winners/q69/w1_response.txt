  "explanation": "Transformed correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries into joins with pre-filtered CTEs. Isolated date_dim filter into a single CTE (date_range) reused across all fact tables. Created three customer-key CTEs (store_sales_customers, web_sales_customers, catalog_sales_customers) that scan each fact table only once with early date filtering. Main query now performs simple joins and NULL checks instead of repeated correlated subqueries, eliminating O(n²) behavior. Pushes ca_state filter early."
