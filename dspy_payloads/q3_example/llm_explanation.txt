We optimized by isolating the dimensional filters (`date_dim.d_moy = 11` and `item.i_manufact_id = 816`) into separate CTEs (`filtered_dates` and `filtered_items`). This allows the query to first reduce the dimension tables to only the relevant rows (150 and 51 rows respectively) before joining with the large `store_sales` fact table. The main query now joins these pre-filtered CTEs, which should dramatically reduce the number of `store_sales` rows that need to be processed (since the joins can use the filtered dimension keys). This addresses the 88.9% cost sequential scan on `store_sales` by applying selective filters earlier in the execution plan.
