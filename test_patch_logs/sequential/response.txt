Changes: Decorrelated the AVG subquery by pre-computing store-wise average thresholds in a new CTE (`store_avg_thresholds`), then replaced the correlated subquery in the WHERE clause with a simple lookup from this CTE.

Expected speedup: ~25x (similar to reference example, due to elimination of correlated subquery and pre-computation of aggregates).
