P1: DECORRELATE — expected speedup: 20x (precompute store averages, remove correlation)
P2: PREDICATE PUSHDOWN — expected speedup: 25x (push reason_sk and store filters into CTE)
P3: RESTRUCTURE — expected speedup: 1.5x (explicit joins only)
P4: COMBINED — expected speedup: 30x (pushdown + decorrelation + explicit joins)
