P1: DECORRELATE — expected speedup: high (eliminates correlated subquery runtime overhead)  
P2: PREDICATE PUSHDOWN — expected speedup: medium (reduces CTE result size early)  
P3: RESTRUCTURE — expected speedup: low (improves join clarity for optimizer)  
P4: COMBINED — expected speedup: very high (combines decorrelation, filtering, and join optimizations)
