P1: DECORRELATE — expected speedup: 2.5× (eliminates correlated subquery execution per row)
P2: PREDICATE PUSHDOWN — expected speedup: 1.8× (reduces CTE rows early with reason_sk filter)
P3: RESTRUCTURE — expected speedup: 1.3× (enables better join ordering and predicate pushdown)
P4: COMBINED — expected speedup: 3.8× (eliminates correlation, reduces CTE rows, and optimizes join order)
