P1: DECORRELATE — expected speedup: 25x (further decorrelation with pre-aggregated store averages)
P2: PREDICATE PUSHDOWN — expected speedup: 22x (push reason_sk filter into CTE, keep other predicates)
P3: RESTRUCTURE — expected speedup: 5x (explicit joins only, preserve all predicates)
P4: COMBINED — expected speedup: 30x (pushdown + decorrelation + explicit joins)
