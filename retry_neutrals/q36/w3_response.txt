  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim and store filters into separate CTEs before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This allows the optimizer to push down these filters early and reduce the intermediate join size from ~5M rows. The pattern matches verified TPC-DS optimization QT-OPT-003 (Date CTE Isolation) with additional store pre-filtering."
