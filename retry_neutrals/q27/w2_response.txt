Looking at the query structure and cost analysis, I can see the main cost driver is scanning the `store_sales` table three times (due to the UNION ALL in main_query reusing the results CTE). I'll apply multiple optimizations: dimension CTE isolation to pre-filter dimensions, then materialize the results CTE to prevent multiple scans.

  ],
  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Dimension CTE Isolation to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, store) before joining with the large store_sales fact table. This reduces the cardinality of joins. 2) Materialize the results CTE to prevent the expensive store_sales scan from being executed three times (once for each UNION ALL branch in the main query). The materialized CTE is computed once and reused, trading memory for computation time."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. The original query scans `store_sales` three times because the `results` CTE is inlined into each UNION ALL branch
2. By pre-filtering dimension tables with selective predicates (`d_year=2002`, `s_state='TN'`, etc.), we reduce the join cardinality significantly
3. Materializing the CTE computes the filtered join once and reuses it, avoiding 2 extra scans of the 345M row `store_sales` table
4. The combined effect should yield ~4x speedup (1.8x from dimension filtering × 2.2x from materialization)
