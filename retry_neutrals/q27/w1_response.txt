  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim, store, and customer_demographics filters into separate CTEs before joining with store_sales. This reduces store_sales scans from 3 to 1 (eliminating 2 full sequential scans) and applies dimension filters early to drastically reduce the working set. The filtered_sales CTE joins only filtered dimension keys, cutting 75% of the original cost from unnecessary store_sales scans."
