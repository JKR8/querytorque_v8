  "explanation": "1) Pre-filtered all three dimension tables (date_dim, store, customer_demographics) into CTEs to create smaller working sets before joining with the large store_sales fact table. This isolates the selective filters early and reduces the volume of data flowing into the main join. 2) Reordered joins to put the most selective dimension (customer_demographics with 27,440 rows) before the less selective one (store with 31 rows) to minimize intermediate join cardinality."
