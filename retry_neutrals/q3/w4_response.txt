  "explanation": "Created filtered CTEs for date_dim and item before joining with store_sales. This prevents full table scans by pushing filters into the CTEs, allowing the store_sales join to start with pre-filtered dimension tables. The join order now begins with store_sales joined to filtered dimensions rather than scanning all 345M store_sales rows first."
