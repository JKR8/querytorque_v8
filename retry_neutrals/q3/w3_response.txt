  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter (d_moy=11) into a CTE that reduces 73,049 rows to 6,000 rows before joining with the large store_sales table (345M rows). This enables early filtering and reduces the join size significantly. The item filter (i_manufact_id=128) remains as a regular WHERE clause since it already filters to 180 rows. This follows the QT-OPT-003 pattern from detected opportunities."
