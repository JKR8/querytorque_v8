Looking at the query pattern, I can identify a repeated subquery pattern in both `ss_items` and `ws_items` CTEs that can be optimized using a single CTE for the week dates. This is a classic "Materialize Repeated Subquery" optimization.

        "ss_items": "SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev FROM store_sales JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN week_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = week_dates.d_date_sk GROUP BY i_item_id",
        "ws_items": "SELECT i_item_id AS item_id, SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS ws_item_rev FROM web_sales JOIN item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN week_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = week_dates.d_date_sk GROUP BY i_item_id",

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Extracted the repeated subquery for week dates into a materialized CTE 'week_dates'. This CTE computes the d_date_sk values for the target week once and is reused in both ss_items and ws_items CTEs. The original query had 9 scans of date_dim (3 for each CTE), which is now reduced to 2 scans (one for the week_dates CTE and one for the subquery inside it). This eliminates redundant date_dim scans and join operations."
