  "explanation": "Applied multiple optimizations: 1) Isolated date_dim filtering for d1 to only years 1999 and 2000 using date_cte_isolate pattern, reducing join cardinality early. 2) Created filtered CTEs for dimension tables with simple predicates to reduce join complexity. 3) Pushed syear filters into the cross_sales CTE before main query execution, reducing data movement between CTEs. These transforms work together to reduce the 47.8% cost of cross_sales computation by filtering date_dim early and minimizing unnecessary joins."
