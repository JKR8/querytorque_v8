  "explanation": "Created filtered_dates CTE to isolate date_dim filtering, which reduces the fact table join from scanning the entire date_dim to only 12 months. Also extracted warehouse substring computation into a CTE to compute once. This enables the optimizer to push the date filter into the catalog_sales join early, drastically reducing intermediate row counts before subsequent dimension joins."
