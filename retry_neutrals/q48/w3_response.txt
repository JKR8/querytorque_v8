  "explanation": "Applied two complementary rewrites: (1) OR-to-UNION decomposition splits the complex OR conditions into three disjoint branches, enabling better predicate pushdown and index usage on customer_demographics and customer_address. (2) Date CTE isolation pre-joins store_sales with filtered dates, reducing the fact table early before expensive dimension joins. The transforms can be applied independently or combined for maximum speedup."
