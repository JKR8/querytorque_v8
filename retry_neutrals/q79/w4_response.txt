  "explanation": "Split OR condition (hd_dep_count=6 OR hd_vehicle_count>2) into two UNION ALL branches, each with focused predicates. Added filter 'hd_dep_count != 6' to second branch to avoid duplicates where both conditions match. Isolated date_dim and store filters into CTEs to push them early and reduce join cardinality. The rewritten query scans store_sales once with simpler filters and avoids the expensive OR evaluation on large rowsets."
