  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) to reduce their cardinality before joining with the large store_sales fact table. This allows early filtering and reduces the size of the hash joins. The date_dim CTE isolates the date filter (d_dow=1, d_year in 1999-2001), reducing from 73,049 rows to ~157 rows. The store CTE filters by employee count, reducing from 102 to 94 rows. The household_demographics CTE applies the OR condition once, reducing from 7,200 rows to only matching rows. These pre-filtered dimension tables are then joined with store_sales, reducing the intermediate join size before aggregation."
