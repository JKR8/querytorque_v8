Looking at this query, I can identify two key optimization opportunities:

1. **Correlated subquery** - The subquery is correlated by `i_item_sk` and computes an average for each item, then the main query compares `ws_ext_discount_amt` to 1.3 times that average.
2. **Date filter duplication** - The same date range filter appears in both the main query and subquery, scanning `date_dim` twice.

I can transform this by:
- Decorrelating the subquery by precomputing item averages once
- Isolating the date filter into a CTE to avoid duplicate scans
- Using a single pass through `web_sales` with the precomputed averages

  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing 1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt) per item in a CTE, eliminating N repetitive subquery executions. Created filtered_dates CTE to scan date_dim once and reuse for both parts. Main query now joins with precomputed thresholds, allowing single-pass evaluation of ws_ext_discount_amt > threshold condition."
