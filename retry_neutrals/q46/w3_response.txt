  "explanation": "Created three prefetch CTEs: filtered_dates, filtered_store, and filtered_hd. These isolate the dimension table filters early, reducing the data volume before joining with the large store_sales fact table. The filtered_hd CTE keeps the OR condition intact but applies it before the join. This reduces the rows processed in the main join sequence and leverages the cost model's tendency to misestimate filtered dimension cardinalities."
