  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations. rs_01 decomposes the OR condition (hd_dep_count=4 OR hd_vehicle_count=3) into UNION ALL branches, allowing separate index usage and eliminating OR predicate evaluation. rs_02 pushes date_dim and store filters early into CTEs to reduce the store_sales scan before joining. Both preserve all semantic invariants while reducing the heavy SEQ_SCAN on store_sales (76% of original cost)."
