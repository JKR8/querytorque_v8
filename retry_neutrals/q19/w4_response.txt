  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE (30 rows) to reduce store_sales scan from full table to only matching rows. Created filtered_items CTE for i_manager_id = 8 filter to reduce early joins. Created filtered_stores CTE to avoid rescanning store table. This transforms the query from scanning 345M store_sales rows with late filtering to scanning only the 880K rows matching the date condition early."
