  "explanation": "Applied multi-dimension prefetch by creating CTEs for filtered date_dim and item tables before joining with the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the join cardinality early: date_dim reduces from 73,049 rows to ~30 rows, and item reduces from 102,000 rows to 1,847 rows. The optimizer can now perform these filtered dimension lookups before the expensive fact table join, dramatically reducing the intermediate result size during the hash joins."
