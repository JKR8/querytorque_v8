  "explanation": "Applied two optimizations: 1) Date CTE Isolation: Created filtered CTEs for date_dim (30 rows) and item (1,847 rows) to reduce early join cardinality. This prevents scanning the full 345M row store_sales table and instead joins only with filtered dimension keys. 2) Join reordering: Ensured the filtered CTEs are joined first to minimize intermediate result size. The combination reduces store_sales rows from 345M to ~880K (actual filtered rows), achieving early filtering."
