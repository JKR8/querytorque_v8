Looking at this query, I can identify several optimization opportunities. The main issues are:
1. The `year_total` CTE scans all years but the main query only needs years 2001 and 2002
2. Each UNION branch repeats the same pattern with different fact tables
3. The main query joins the same CTE 6 times with different filters

I'll apply multiple optimizations including date isolation, pushdown, and semantic rewrites.

  "explanation": "Applied three optimizations: 1) Isolated date filtering to create a CTE for years 2001-2002 only, reducing date_dim scans from 6 to 1 and eliminating unnecessary year data. 2) Split the UNION ALL into separate CTEs per sale type to allow better optimization and join planning. 3) Pushed down dyear filters into each CTE to create specialized aggregations for each year, eliminating the need for runtime filtering and reducing data processed in each aggregation by ~50%. This reduces the total scans of large fact tables and allows more efficient join strategies."
