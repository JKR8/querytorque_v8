Looking at this query, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The same date_dim filter (`d_year=1998 AND d_moy=5`) is used across all three sales CTEs (ss, ws, cs). We can isolate this into a single CTE.
2. **Repeated Subquery Materialization**: The `i_manufact_id IN (SELECT ... FROM item WHERE i_category IN ('Electronics'))` subquery is repeated across all three sales CTEs. We can materialize this once.
3. **Early Filtering**: The `customer_address` filter (`ca_gmt_offset = -5`) is applied late in each CTE after joins.

Here's my optimized rewrite:

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Created three reusable CTEs: 1) filtered_dates - isolates date_dim filter once (reducing 3 scans to 1), 2) electronics_manufacturers - materializes the repeated subquery for Electronics manufacturers, 3) filtered_addresses - applies customer_address filter early before expensive joins. Changed IN subquery to JOIN for better optimization. All three sales CTEs now use these pre-filtered dimensions, reducing row counts before aggregation."
