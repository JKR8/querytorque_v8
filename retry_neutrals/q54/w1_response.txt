  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filters into reusable CTEs (dec_1998_dates, next_three_months_dates) to avoid repeated scans and decorrelate the date range subquery. Also pushed item filter early to reduce catalog_sales/web_sales joins. This reduces 4 date_dim scans to 1, eliminates correlated subqueries, and filters item early."
