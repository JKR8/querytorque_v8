  "explanation": "rs_01 applies date_cte_isolate to pre-filter date_dim tables and item table before expensive joins. Creates three date CTEs: one for my_customers (d_year=1998, d_moy=12), one anchor for month_seq range calculation, and one for my_revenue (d_month_seq range). Also pre-filters item table. This reduces cardinality early in both CTEs. rs_02 pushes date filters directly into the UNION ALL subquery to filter fact tables (catalog_sales, web_sales) before joining with dimensions, reducing fact table rows early."
