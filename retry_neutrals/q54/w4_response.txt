  "explanation": "Applied three optimizations: 1) Isolated date_dim filters into CTEs to reduce repeated scanning of large date_dim table and push filters early into fact table scans. 2) Decorrelated scalar subqueries for month_seq range by computing bounds once and joining. 3) Pushed item filter early into UNION ALL branches to reduce rows before joining with customer. This transforms 4 scans of date_dim to 2 CTEs, reduces item scan from 102K to ~2.5K rows early, and eliminates redundant computation of month_seq bounds."
