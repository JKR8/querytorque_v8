  "explanation": "Created separate CTEs for filtered dimensions (date_dim, store, household_demographics) to push filters EARLY before the large store_sales join. This reduces the store_sales scan from 345M rows to only those matching filtered dimension keys. The main aggregation then operates on a much smaller intermediate result."
