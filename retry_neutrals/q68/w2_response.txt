  "explanation": "Rewrote the OR condition on household_demographics into two disjoint branches using UNION ALL. This allows each branch to use efficient indexes/scan patterns. Also isolated date_dim and store filters into CTEs to enable early filtering of store_sales before the expensive joins. The UNION ALL approach eliminates row duplication while maintaining correct aggregation semantics."
