Looking at this query, I can see several opportunities for optimization. The main issues are:
1. The same date_dim filter (d_year=2001 and d_moy=12) is applied three times across the UNION branches
2. Each branch has a complex aggregation with window functions that could be simplified
3. There's potential to push filters earlier in the query plan

Here's my optimized version:

  "explanation": "Created a shared CTE for filtered dates to avoid scanning date_dim three times. Added filtered CTEs for each sales table to push profit/paid/quantity filters earlier in the query plan, reducing the number of rows processed in joins. Modified return amount filters to preserve LEFT JOIN semantics while still filtering when returns exist. This reduces I/O and CPU costs by filtering early and reusing the date_dim scan."
