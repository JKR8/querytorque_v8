## Previous Optimization Attempts (4 workers tried, none reached 2.0x)

### W3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch → 1.62x ★ BEST [PASS, below target (1.62x)]
- **Examples**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Approach**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables early, then compute both base aggregates and store-level averages in a single pass.
- **SQL** (abbreviated):
```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2000
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state = 'SD'
),
store_returns_filtered AS (
    SELECT 
        sr.sr_customer_sk,
        sr.sr_store_sk,
        sr.SR_FEE
    FROM store_returns sr
    INNER JOIN filtered_date fd ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_store fs ON sr.sr_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk
),
customer_store_returns AS (
-- ... (truncated)
```

### W2: moderate_dimension_isolation → 1.50x [PASS, below target (1.50x)]
- **Examples**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Approach**: Pre-filter date_dim and store dimension into separate CTEs before the main aggregation to enable better predicate pushdown.
- **SQL** (abbreviated):
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2000
), filtered_stores AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk
  FROM store
  WHERE s_state = 'SD'
), customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns
  JOIN filtered_dates ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_stores ON sr_store_sk = s_store_sk
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
-- ... (truncated)
```

### W4: novel_correlation_elimination → 1.01x [PASS, below target (1.01x)]
- **Examples**: decorrelate, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Approach**: Eliminate the correlated subquery by precomputing store averages, and explore alternative joins using UNION branches for state filtering.
- **SQL** (abbreviated):
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
),
store_avg_return AS (
  SELECT
    ctr_store_sk,
    AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold
  FROM customer_total_return
  GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
)
SELECT
-- ... (truncated)
```

### W1: conservative_predicate_pushdown → 1.01x [PASS, below target (1.01x)]
- **Examples**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Approach**: Push filters early into CTEs and materialize reusable aggregates to reduce intermediate data volume before joins.
- **SQL** (abbreviated):
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
),
filtered_stores AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk
  FROM store
  WHERE s_state = 'SD'
),
customer_returns_sd AS (
  SELECT
    ctr.ctr_customer_sk,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### What's been exhausted
- **Strategies tried**: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch, moderate_dimension_isolation, novel_correlation_elimination, conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Examples used across workers**: date_cte_isolate, decorrelate, dimension_cte_isolate, early_filter, intersect_to_exists, materialize_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, or_to_union, prefetch_fact_join, pushdown, shared_dimension_multi_channel, single_pass_aggregation
- **Best result**: 1.62x (target: 2.0x)

### Your task
Find an UNEXPLORED optimization angle that reaches >=2.0x. Do NOT repeat the strategies above — they have already been tried and fell short.

---
You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_1_snipe

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE
    sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. customer_total_return
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate 2000 store returns to one row per (customer, store), summing return fees as each customer's total return amount at that store.
**Stats**: 50% Cost | ~1k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return]
**Dependencies**: store_returns, date_dim (join)
**Joins**: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2000
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
  SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE
  sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY
  sr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk
```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Intent**: Compare each customer-store return total against 1.2x the same store's average return total, keep only South Dakota stores, join to customer, and output ordered customer IDs.
**Stats**: 50% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, CORRELATED_SUBQUERY(ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk), ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_customer_id] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery)
**Joins**: s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk | ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
**Filters**: ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk) | s_state = 'SD'
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, HASH_JOIN, SEQ_SCAN[customer_total_return], SEQ_SCAN[store], SEQ_SCAN[customer]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Edges

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

### 4. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

### 5. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: decorrelate on q1 (0.71xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not pre-aggregate GROUP BY results into CTEs when the query uses them in a correlated comparison (e.g., customer return > 1.2x store average). The optimizer can compute aggregates incrementally with filter pushdown; materialization loses this.
**Why it regressed:** Pre-computed customer_total_return (GROUP BY customer, store) and store_avg_return (GROUP BY store) as separate CTEs. The original correlated subquery computed the per-store average incrementally during the customer scan, filtering as it goes. Materializing forces full aggregation of ALL stores before any filtering.

### Warning 2: date_cte_isolate on q51 (0.87xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering together.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized cumulative window functions (SUM() OVER ORDER BY) into separate CTEs (web_v1, store_v1) before a FULL OUTER JOIN that filters on web_cumulative > store_cumulative. The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
