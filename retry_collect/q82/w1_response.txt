Looking at the query and execution plan, I can see the main issues:

1. **Store_sales table is being scanned without filtering** - 172M rows scanned
2. **Multiple sequential scans of inventory table** (3x)
3. **Join misestimates causing poor planning** (estimates are off by up to 9495x)
4. **Date filter can be isolated early** to reduce joined rows

The query has a GROUP BY on item columns without aggregates, making it effectively a DISTINCT query for items that have matching inventory and store_sales. Let me rewrite:

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_date": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2000-05-25' AS DATE) AND CAST('2000-07-24' AS DATE)",
        "filtered_item": "SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM item WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 62 AND 62 + 30 AND i_manufact_id IN (129, 270, 821, 423)",
        "filtered_inventory": "SELECT inv_item_sk FROM inventory inv JOIN filtered_date fd ON inv.inv_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500",
        "items_with_inventory": "SELECT DISTINCT fi.i_item_sk, fi.i_item_id, fi.i_item_desc, fi.i_current_price FROM filtered_item fi JOIN filtered_inventory finv ON fi.i_item_sk = finv.inv_item_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM items_with_inventory iwi WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM store_sales ss WHERE ss.ss_item_sk = iwi.i_item_sk) ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same output columns",
        "same item filtering conditions",
        "same inventory/date constraints"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "3.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Isolated date filter early to reduce inventory scans from 3 to 1. Pushed item filters early. Converted store_sales join to EXISTS subquery to avoid scanning entire 172M row table. Used DISTINCT early to reduce cardinality before final filter."
}
