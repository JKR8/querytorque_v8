  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce early join cardinality. Applied multi_push_predicate to push item and inventory filters into separate CTEs. Converted catalog_sales join to EXISTS since catalog_sales columns are not used in SELECT/GROUP BY (only for filtering). This reduces expensive joins while preserving semantics."
