## Example: OR to UNION ALL (OR_TO_UNION)
Verified speedup: 3.17x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk

       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100

**Key insight:** Each OR branch becomes a separate query with focused predicates. Date filter is extracted as CTE and joined into each branch.

**Key insight:** INTERSECT forces materialization and sorting of all three subqueries before computing set intersection. Converting to EXISTS allows the optimizer to use semi-join strategies and stop early when a match is found. Each EXISTS can use indexes on the join columns.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:

## Execution Plan

Operators by cost:
- SEQ_SCAN(inventory): 50.5% cost, 274 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(inventory): 35.9% cost, 470,573 rows
- SEQ_SCAN(inventory): 7.3% cost, 1,856 rows
- HASH_JOIN: 4.5% cost, 7,124 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 0.7% cost, 1 rows

Scans:
- inventory x1: 591,948,000 → 470,573 rows (filtered)
- catalog_sales x1: 86,393,880 rows (no filter)
- date_dim x1: 73,049 → 61 rows (filtered)
- item x1: 54,000 → 1,856 rows (filtered)
