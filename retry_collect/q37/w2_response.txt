  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce early join cardinality. Created filtered_items CTE to push price/manufacturer filters early. Combined inventory joins into single CTE with date filter applied. Used EXISTS instead of full join for catalog_sales since only existence matters (no columns needed). This reduces row multiplication before grouping."
