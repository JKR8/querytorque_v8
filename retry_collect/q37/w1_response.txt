  "explanation": "Pushed date_dim filter early into CTE to reduce inventory joins. Applied item filters (price, manufacturer) early. Used semi-joins to check inventory and catalog_sales existence rather than full joins. This avoids scanning large fact tables multiple times and reduces intermediate result sizes before final selection."
