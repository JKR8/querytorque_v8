## Example: OR to UNION ALL (OR_TO_UNION)
Verified speedup: 3.17x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100

**Key insight:** Each OR branch becomes a separate query with focused predicates. Date filter is extracted as CTE and joined into each branch.

**Key insight:** INTERSECT forces materialization and sorting of all three subqueries before computing set intersection. Converting to EXISTS allows the optimizer to use semi-join strategies and stop early when a match is found. Each EXISTS can use indexes on the join columns.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Target Nodes
  [main_query] GROUP_BY

## Subgraph Slice
[main_query] type=main
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk AND cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College' AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') AND d_year = 2000 GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```


## Node Contracts
[main_query]:
  output_columns: ['i_item_id', 'agg1', 'agg2', 'agg3', 'agg4']
  grain: ['i_item_id']
  required_predicates: ['d_year = 2000', "cd_education_status = 'College'", "cd_marital_status = 'S'"]

## Downstream Usage
No usage data.

## Cost Attribution
[main_query]: 99.8% cost, ~1432925 rows, ops=[SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales]]

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-001** - OR to UNION ALL Decomposition
  Trigger: OR conditions spanning different columns (col_a = X OR col_b = Y)
  Rewrite: Split into separate SELECTs with UNION ALL, add exclusion predicates to avoid duplicates
   Matched: OR condition in WHERE clause

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
OR_TO_UNION: [main_query] has OR condition
  Fix: Split into UNION ALL branches
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q15: 2.98x)
