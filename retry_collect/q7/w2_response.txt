Looking at the query structure, I can see two main optimization opportunities: isolating date_dim filtering and handling the OR condition efficiently. The OR condition on promotion columns is particularly costly because it prevents early filtering.

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "or_to_union",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "filtered_cd": "SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'",
        "email_promo": "SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N'",
        "event_promo": "SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_event = 'N'",
        "branch1": "SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_quantity, ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN filtered_cd ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk JOIN email_promo ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk",
        "branch2": "SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_quantity, ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN filtered_cd ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk JOIN event_promo ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk",
        "combined_sales": "SELECT * FROM branch1 UNION ALL SELECT * FROM branch2",
        "main_query": "SELECT i_item_id, AVG(ss_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(ss_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(ss_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM combined_sales s JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same column output",
        "same grouping and aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Split OR condition on promotion table into two branches using UNION ALL. Each branch can use separate promotion filters and potentially different execution paths. Created CTEs for filtered date_dim and customer_demographics to push filters early. This allows store_sales to be filtered by both date and demographics before joining to promotion, reducing the number of rows processed in the OR branches."
