  "explanation": "The original query scans store_sales 15 times (5 buckets × 3 subqueries each). This rewrite computes all required aggregates (COUNT, AVG of two columns) for all quantity ranges in a single pass through store_sales, then reuses those pre-computed values. This eliminates 14 redundant table scans while preserving exact semantics, including handling of empty ranges (NULL averages)."
