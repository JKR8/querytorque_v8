Looking at this query, I see a significant opportunity to transform OR conditions to UNION ALL patterns and isolate date filtering into CTEs. The query has multiple OR conditions that can be decomposed into separate branches.

  "explanation": "Transformed OR condition on date_dim.d_dom into UNION ALL of two branches: one for d_dom 1-3 and another for d_dom 25-28. This allows each branch to use more efficient date range filters and potentially leverage indexes on d_dom. Also pre-filtered store and household_demographics into CTEs to reduce join sizes early. The HAVING filter (cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20) is pushed into each branch to reduce intermediate result sizes."
