## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W1 achieved 0.83x via conservative_early_filtering. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_91_snipe

```sql
SELECT
  cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
  cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
  cc_manager AS Manager,
  SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
WHERE
  cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  AND d_year = 2001
  AND d_moy = 11
  AND (
    (
      cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
    )
    OR (
      cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'
    )
  )
  AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
  AND ca_gmt_offset = -6
GROUP BY
  cc_call_center_id,
  cc_name,
  cc_manager,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status
ORDER BY
  SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Join catalog returns to call center, date, and customer demographic/address dimensions; apply month/year and profile filters; group by call center attributes (and demographic grouping columns); and order by highest return loss.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY
**Outputs**: [Call_Center, Call_Center_Name, Manager, Returns_Loss] — ordered by SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC
**Dependencies**: call_center, catalog_returns (join), date_dim (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join)
**Joins**: cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk | cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk | cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk | cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk | hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk | ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2001 | d_moy = 11 | ((cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown') OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')) | hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%' | ca_gmt_offset = -6
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[call_center], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,
  cc_name AS Call_Center_Name,
  cc_manager AS Manager,
  SUM(cr_net_loss) AS Returns_Loss
FROM call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
WHERE
  cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  AND d_year = 2001
  AND d_moy = 11
  AND (
    (
      cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
    )
    OR (
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Call_Center`
  2. `Call_Center_Name`
  3. `Manager`
  4. `Returns_Loss`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
