**Changes**: Applied aggressive prefetch by pre-filtering May 2000 dates into a CTE, simplified frequent_ss_items to output only needed item_sk, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and removed redundant GROUP BY columns that weren't referenced downstream.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by reducing I/O through early date filtering and minimizing materialized data in CTEs while preserving exact semantics.
