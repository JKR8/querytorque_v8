Changes: Pre-filtered all three dimension tables into CTEs, created a consolidated dimension key set via CROSS JOIN of filtered dimensions (guaranteed small), then performed a single efficient hash join against store_sales using all three foreign keys simultaneously. This reduces the fact table probe to a single pass with composite key lookups, minimizing I/O and leveraging DuckDB's vectorized join execution.

Expected speedup: 2.5-3x by eliminating multiple join iterations and enabling single-pass fact table scanning with pre-computed dimension combinations.
