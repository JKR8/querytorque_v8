Changes: Created a staged join pipeline that filters date_dim first, then pre-joins all dimension tables with store_sales before aggregation. Restructured window computation to compute RANK before AVG to avoid repeated scans, and converted self-joins to LEFT JOINs for clarity.
Expected speedup: 2-3x by reducing fact table scanning through early dimension filtering and reordering window computations.
