WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables and push filters into CTEs to minimize data movement and reduce join sizes before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs, then join with facts to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce window partition sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact data before full aggregation, then restructure window computations to avoid repeated scanning.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Convert OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, transform self-join patterns to EXISTS-like logic, and decorrelate through pre-materialized CTEs.
