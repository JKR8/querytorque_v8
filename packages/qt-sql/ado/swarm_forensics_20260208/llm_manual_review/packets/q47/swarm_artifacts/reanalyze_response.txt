FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts failed because they only addressed surface-level optimizations without targeting the core bottlenecks. Worker 1-3 focused on dimension isolation/pre-filtering, but DuckDB's optimizer already pushes these filters efficiently. Worker 4's OR-to-UNION actually harmed performance by tripling join work. Worker 5's LAG/LEAD approach was promising but missed critical opportunities: (1) The window function partitions (5 columns) create massive intermediate states due to high cardinality combinations. (2) The self-join elimination didn't address the expensive AVG(SUM()) over partition which recomputes per-row aggregates. (3) No attempt to reduce the 4-table join's combinatorial explosion via early aggregation.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Single-pass aggregation with conditional windows**: Compute SUM() once with FILTER clauses for different date ranges, avoiding repeated partitioning.
2. **Dimension pre-aggregation**: Aggregate sales by (item, store) before joining with dimensions to reduce join cardinality.
3. **Materialized rank elimination**: Replace RANK() with computed row numbers using filtered aggregation.
4. **Predicate-aware window pruning**: Since final query only needs d_year=2001 with adjacent months, compute windows only for required 3-month window per group.
5. **Vectorized execution optimization**: Structure CTEs to enable DuckDB's vectorized joins and aggregations.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Combine early fact-table aggregation with filtered window computations. First, aggregate store_sales at the (item, store, date) level with pre-computed date filters. Then join to dimensions once. Use conditional aggregation to compute current vs adjacent month sales in single pass, avoiding the self-join entirely. Finally, compute the deviation metric only for the target year.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation, pushdown
HINT: Pre-aggregate store_sales filtered by date range first, then compute adjacent month differences via LAG/LEAD with explicit bounds, avoiding the expensive 5-column partition. Use FILTER clauses in window functions to isolate 2001 averages.
