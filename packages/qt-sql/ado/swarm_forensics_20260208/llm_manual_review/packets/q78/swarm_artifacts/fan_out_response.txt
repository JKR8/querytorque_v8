WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables to reduce fact table joins, and ensure repeated subquery patterns are materialized for reuse.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date filtering into a reusable CTE, pre-filter all dimension tables separately, and extract shared dimension logic across web/store/catalog CTEs.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in dedicated CTEs, prefetch multiple dimension filters simultaneously, and consolidate the three channel CTEs into a single aggregation pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform the OR condition in the final WHERE into UNION ALL branches, convert implicit set logic to EXISTS for better join planning, and decorrelate any hidden subquery dependencies.
