## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables to reduce fact table joins, and ensure repeated subquery patterns are materialized for reuse.

- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel

  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in dedicated CTEs, prefetch multiple dimension filters simultaneously, and consolidate the three channel CTEs into a single aggregation pass.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
