WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe filter pushdown and materialization strategies to reduce data early without restructuring joins; focus on minimizing risk while improving cardinality reduction.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining to the fact table; isolate date_dim first, then customer and address with their respective filters.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with CTE chains that pre-join filtered dimensions to the fact table in stages; consider consolidating operations into single passes where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_restructuring
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform the complex OR condition using UNION ALL branches to enable better index usage; explore structural transformations of the predicate logic.
