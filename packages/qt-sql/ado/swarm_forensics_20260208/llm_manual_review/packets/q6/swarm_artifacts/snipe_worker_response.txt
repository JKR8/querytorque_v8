**Changes**: Isolated the month-sequence lookup and category-average computation into independent CTEs, enabling hash-join optimizations and eliminating correlated subqueries. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimization.

**Expected speedup**: 2.2x – by materializing small dimension filters (target_month ≈1 row, category_avg ≈#categories) and allowing the planner to build efficient hash joins without repeated subquery execution.
