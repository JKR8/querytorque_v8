## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.54x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into CTEs early, filter dimension tables before joins, and isolate customer dimension prefetching to reduce row counts in all union branches.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year IN (1999, 2000)
),

### Worker 2: moderate_date_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, union_cte_split, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date filtering into a dedicated CTE, split the UNION ALL by sale_type, and share filtered date_dim across all three sales channels to eliminate redundant filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year IN (1999, 2000)
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (1.24x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Create separate prefiltered CTEs for each date range (1999, 2000) and each dimension, then pre-join dimensions with facts before the main union to reduce join cardinality.

```sql
WITH year_1999_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1999

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transformation

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the self-join pattern to use EXISTS, restructure OR-like conditions in final filters to UNION ALL branches, and attempt to consolidate the three sales channel aggregations into a single pass using conditional aggregation.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
