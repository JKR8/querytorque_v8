**Changes:** Created CTEs for filtered dimension tables (household_demographics, date_dim, store) and restructured the query to use explicit joins. This allows the optimizer to push filters earlier and reduces the complexity of the main join.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.5-2x due to better filter pushdown and elimination of implicit cross joins. The OR condition remains in a single CTE because splitting it would risk double-counting due to potential overlap between the two conditions on the same table.
