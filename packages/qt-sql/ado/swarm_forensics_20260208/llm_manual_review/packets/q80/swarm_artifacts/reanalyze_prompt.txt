## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
- **Status**: pass (1.07x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters into CTEs early, materializing repeated dimension lookups, and reducing intermediate result sizes through standard predicate pushdown.

WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-08-28' AS DATE)

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.91x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel

  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-08-28' AS DATE) AND

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.86x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then consider consolidating multi-channel aggregations into a single scan for radical join reduction.

- **Status**: pass (1.82x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
