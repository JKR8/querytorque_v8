## Optimization Strategy: 1. **Single base CTE with materialization**: Compute the full `ssales` aggregation once with all necessary columns, then reuse it for both color queries.
2. **Precompute threshold**: Calculate the 0.05*average(netpaid) from the base CTE in a separate CTE to avoid recalculating for each HAVING.
3. **Early aggressive filtering**: Filter store by market_id=8 first, then join with customer_address using s_zip=ca_zip before joining with customer to reduce cross products.
4. **Column pruning**: In base CTE, keep only columns needed for final output and filtering (c_last_name, c_first_name, s_store_name, i_color, netpaid).
5. **Batch color processing**: Use conditional aggregation or separate filtered queries on the materialized base CTE.

**Your approach**: Create a fully materialized base CTE with all joins and aggregation, then filter by color in separate queries using the same materialized CTE. Precompute the HAVING threshold once. Use WITH to materialize the base result.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_24_final

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. materialize_cte (1.37x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization: extract repeated subquery patterns into CTEs to avoid recomputation. When the same logical check appears multiple times, compute it once and reference the result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with ws_wh as
(select ws1.ws_order_number,ws1.ws_warehouse_sk wh1,ws2.ws_warehouse_sk wh2
 from web_sales ws1,web_sales ws2
 where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
   and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
 select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '1999-2-01' and 
           (cast('1999-2-01' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = 'NC'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_company_name = 'pri'
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select ws_order_number
                            from ws_wh)
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select wr_order_number
                            from web_returns,ws_wh
                            where wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)
order by count(distinct ws_order_number)
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[multi_warehouse_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
```
[returned_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL
```

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) end bucket3,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) > 3188917
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid1, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid2, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid3, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid4, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid5 FROM store_sales
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 3. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 4. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 5. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: semantic_rewrite on q95 (0.54xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not decompose tightly-correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS clause pairs into independent CTEs. Their cardinality estimates depend on each other; materializing them independently causes severe join cost misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized complex correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS logic into independent CTEs (multi_warehouse_orders, returned_multi_warehouse_orders). The original EXISTS clauses were tightly correlated and evaluated together. Decoupling them into CTEs severed their cardinality relationship, causing 4x+ join estimate errors.

### Warning 2: decorrelate on q1 (0.71xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not pre-aggregate GROUP BY results into CTEs when the query uses them in a correlated comparison (e.g., customer return > 1.2x store average). The optimizer can compute aggregates incrementally with filter pushdown; materialization loses this.
**Why it regressed:** Pre-computed customer_total_return (GROUP BY customer, store) and store_avg_return (GROUP BY store) as separate CTEs. The original correlated subquery computed the per-store average incrementally during the customer scan, filtering as it goes. Materializing forces full aggregation of ALL stores before any filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `s_store_name`
  4. `paid`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql

```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```

Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
