## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_basic_optimizations
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced table "s" not found!
Candidate tables: "ss", "sr"

LINE 71:     s.s_state,
             ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering on dimension tables before joining with facts, push predicates into CTE definitions, and materialize repeated CTEs to avoid recomputation across queries.

```sql
WITH filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_state, s_zip

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: fail (1.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining, extract shared dimension constraints (like market_id), and isolate date-like filters even though none exist—apply similarly to customer/customer_address.

```sql
WITH filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_state, s_zip

    WHERE s_market_id = 8

### Worker 3: aggressive_restructure_with_prefetch
- **Status**: fail (0.78x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs, prefetch multiple dimension filters into a single CTE, and consolidate the two color queries into one pass with conditional aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_state, s_zip

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: column threshold must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Convert OR conditions (like birth_country <> country) into UNION ALL branches, transform HAVING subqueries to decorrelated joins, and re-express set operations as EXISTS patterns if they appear.

```sql
WITH ssales_base AS (
  SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
