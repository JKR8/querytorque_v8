**Changes:** Created separate CTEs for each dimension table with their respective filters (date, item) or minimal column selection (customer, address, store), enabling early filtering and small hash table joins before the final aggregation.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.5-2x by isolating dimension lookups, reducing the working set for the large fact table join, and allowing DuckDB to build optimal hash tables from pre-filtered CTEs.
