**Changes**: Created staged CTEs to pre-filter date_dim and item, then pre-joined them with store_sales to aggressively reduce the fact table before joining with the remaining dimensions (customer, customer_address, store). This follows the aggressive_prefetch_restructuring strategy by maximizing early reduction through selective dimension filtering.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x due to early fact table reduction from selective date and item filters, reducing the cardinality before joining with larger dimensions and applying the ZIP mismatch condition.
