FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All previous attempts fell short because they only optimized dimension filtering while ignoring the fundamental structural inefficiency: three separate full scans of massive fact tables (store_returns, catalog_returns, web_returns) with identical date filtering. Each CTE repeats the same expensive join pattern, scanning multi-TB fact tables independently. The modest gains (1.07-1.22x) came from caching dimension filters, but the dominant cost (~95%+) remains the triple sequential I/O of fact tables. Worker 3's 1.22x showed join order matters, but didn't address the core redundancy.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Single-pass multi-fact aggregation**: Combine three separate fact table scans into one logical pass using UNION ALL with channel tagging before aggregation.
2. **Pre-aggregation pushdown**: Aggregate at storage level using DuckDB's row-group pruning on date_sk columns.
3. **Early fact reduction**: Filter fact tables by date_sk BEFORE any joins using bloom filters or semi-joins.
4. **Parallel channel processing**: Use DuckDB's parallel scan capabilities across fact tables simultaneously.
5. **Materialized intermediate**: Pre-materialize the smallest filtered fact subsets before joining with dimensions.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Restructure query to scan each fact table only once with maximal predicate pushdown, then combine immediately for single-pass aggregation. Use a channel-tagged UNION ALL to merge filtered fact rows before joining with dimensions, enabling:
1. **Bloom-filter semi-joins**: Pre-filter fact tables using compact date_sk bitmap from date_dim CTE
2. **Single dimension join**: Join with item table only once on the combined filtered fact set
3. **Vectorized aggregation**: Compute all three channel sums in one GROUP BY pass
4. **Row-group pruning**: Leverage DuckDB's metadata to skip irrelevant row-groups in fact tables

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, pushdown, early_filter, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Create a date_sk bloom filter CTE, then UNION ALL all three returns tables filtered by this bitmap before any dimension joins. Aggregate once with conditional sums per channel. Ensure date filter pushes into each UNION branch.
