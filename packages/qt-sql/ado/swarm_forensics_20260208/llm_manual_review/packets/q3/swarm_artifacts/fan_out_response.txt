WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown by pre‑filtering dimension tables in CTEs before joining, minimizing fact‑table rows early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate each filtered dimension (date_dim, item) into separate CTEs, then join with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure into a multi‑step CTE pipeline: pre‑filter dimensions, pre‑join with facts, then aggregate in a single pass, sharing filtered dimensions across channels.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Apply structural transformations such as splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, converting INTERSECT to EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries to unlock alternative join plans.
