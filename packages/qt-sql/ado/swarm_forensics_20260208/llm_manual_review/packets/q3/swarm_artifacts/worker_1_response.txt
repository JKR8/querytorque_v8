    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg

Changes: Created two filtered CTEs for dimension tables (date_dim and item) with all necessary join and output columns before joining with the large fact table store_sales.
Expected speedup: 2-4x by reducing fact table joins to only matching rows early via hash join probes on pre-filtered dimension tables.
