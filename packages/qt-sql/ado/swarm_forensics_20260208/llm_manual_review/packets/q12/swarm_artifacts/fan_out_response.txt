WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables (item, date_dim) to reduce fact table joins, push down all predicates before aggregation, and materialize filtered dimensions as CTEs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with web_sales, enabling independent optimization and predicate pushdown on each dimension.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in a staged CTE, then compute window aggregation separately to reduce intermediate data volume.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the IN clause on i_category into UNION ALL branches, restructure subqueries using EXISTS patterns, and decorrelate hypothetical complex filters.
