WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables first, push predicates into joins, and materialize repeated computations to reduce intermediate data size before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter item and date dimensions into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce fact table join cardinality before aggregation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in staged CTEs, consolidate aggregations into single pass, and defer window computation to minimize scanning.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform IN-list (OR) conditions into UNION ALL branches, rewrite potential subquery patterns as EXISTS, and decorrelate complex joins to improve join planning.
