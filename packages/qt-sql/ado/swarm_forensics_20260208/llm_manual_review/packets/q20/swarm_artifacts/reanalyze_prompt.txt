You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Filter dimension tables first, push predicates into joins, and materialize repeated computations to reduce intermediate data size before aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) 
                    AND (CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter item and date dimensions into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce fact table join cardinality before aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) 
                   AND (CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
