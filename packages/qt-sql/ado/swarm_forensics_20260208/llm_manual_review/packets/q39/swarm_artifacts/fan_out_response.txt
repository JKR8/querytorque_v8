WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, isolate dimension table filtering, and materialize the repeated inv CTE to avoid redundant computation across both query blocks.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter date_dim and other dimension tables into dedicated CTEs before joining with the large fact table, reducing join cardinality early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Restructure the query to prefetch filtered dimension-fact joins, then compute both month aggregates in a single pass, potentially pivoting d_moy values.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore transforming the self-join into UNION/EXISTS patterns or decorrelating subquery structures, even if not directly present, to unlock alternative join plans.
