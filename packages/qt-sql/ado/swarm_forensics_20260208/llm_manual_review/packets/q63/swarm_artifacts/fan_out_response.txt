WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_and_simplify
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into subqueries, filter dimension tables before joining, and extract repeated calculations to CTEs for clarity and potential reuse.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate and pre-filter each dimension table into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and reducing intermediate join sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Radically restructure by prefetching filtered fact-dimension combinations into CTEs, then perform aggregation and window calculations in a consolidated single pass to minimize repeated scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform query structure: split OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, convert INTERSECT logic to EXISTS, and decorrelate complex conditions to enable better join planning and parallelization.
