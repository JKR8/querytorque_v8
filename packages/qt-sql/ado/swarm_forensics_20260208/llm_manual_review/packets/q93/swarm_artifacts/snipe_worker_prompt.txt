## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W1 achieved 0.81x via conservative_early_filter_restructure. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_93_snipe

```sql
SELECT
  ss_customer_sk,
  SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_item_sk,
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    CASE
      WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
      THEN (
        ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity
      ) * ss_sales_price
      ELSE (
        ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
      )
    END AS act_sales
  FROM store_sales
  LEFT OUTER JOIN store_returns
    ON (
      sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
    ), reason
  WHERE
    sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk AND r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
) AS t
GROUP BY
  ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  sumsales,
  ss_customer_sk
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Left-join store sales to returns, compute adjusted sales amount per line using return quantity when present, filter by duplicate-purchase reason, and sum adjusted sales by customer.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [ss_customer_sk, sumsales] — ordered by sumsales ASC, ss_customer_sk ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, store_returns, reason
**Joins**: sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
**Filters**: r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[reason]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  ss_customer_sk,
  SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_item_sk,
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    CASE
      WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
      THEN (
        ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity
      ) * ss_sales_price
      ELSE (
        ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
      )
    END AS act_sales
  FROM store_sales
  LEFT OUTER JOIN store_returns
    ON (
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 2. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ss_sales_price))
      over (partition by ss_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from store_sales
    ,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[web_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM web_sales, date_dim WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
```
[store_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ss_item_sk, d_date
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk, COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date, SUM(web.daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative, SUM(store.daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative FROM web_daily web FULL OUTER JOIN store_daily store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date) y WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative ORDER BY item_sk, d_date LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: decorrelate on q93 (0.34xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not decorrelate correlated LEFT JOINs that the optimizer already executes as semi-joins. Materializing the correlated subquery into a CTE forces redundant scans.
**Why it regressed:** Converted a correlated LEFT JOIN + filter into two materialized CTEs (sales_with_filtered_returns AND filtered_returns), both scanning store_returns. The original correlated LEFT JOIN was efficiently executed as a semi-join during the store_sales scan. Materializing both CTEs forces independent scans and loses the semi-join optimization.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ss_customer_sk`
  2. `sumsales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
