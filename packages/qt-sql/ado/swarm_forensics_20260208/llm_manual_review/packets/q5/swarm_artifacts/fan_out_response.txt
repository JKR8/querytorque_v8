WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering and predicate pushdown aggressively in CTEs to reduce data volume, and materialize reusable date filters.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs to enable reuse across channels and improve predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact tables, then restructure the union to a single-pass aggregation where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_union_transform
EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Split the UNION ALL into specialized CTEs, transform implicit OR conditions to UNION ALL, and decorrelate any nested patterns.
