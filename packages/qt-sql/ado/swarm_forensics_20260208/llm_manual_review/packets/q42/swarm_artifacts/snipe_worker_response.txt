**Changes**: Applied dimension_cte_isolate pattern by pre-filtering both date_dim and item into small CTEs before joining with the large store_sales fact table. This creates tiny hash tables for fast probing.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x - The CTEs dramatically reduce the hash table size for both dimensions, enabling faster fact table scanning with minimal materialization overhead.
