Changes: Split the UNION ALL into channel-specific CTEs, prefiltered date_dim by year (1998 and 1999), pre-joined filtered dates with each sales channel, and created separate aggregated CTEs for each target year. This minimizes intermediate results by applying year filters early and avoiding repeated scanning of the same data.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.5x due to reduced data movement, early filtering, and specialized processing for each year's requirements.
