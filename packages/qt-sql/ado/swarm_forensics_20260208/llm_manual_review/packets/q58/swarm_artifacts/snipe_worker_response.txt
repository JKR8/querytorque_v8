Changes: Created a shared `week_dates` CTE to compute the target week dates once instead of three separate correlated subqueries, and introduced a `filtered_items` CTE to separate join/filter logic from final calculation. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x by eliminating redundant date subquery computation and improving join order flexibility.
