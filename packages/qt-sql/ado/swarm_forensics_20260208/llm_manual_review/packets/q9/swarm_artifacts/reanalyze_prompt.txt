## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_single_pass
- **Status**: pass (0.42x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, single_pass_aggregation, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Consolidate the five independent store_sales scans into a single pass with conditional aggregates using CASE statements, then push filters and materialize the results to avoid redundant computation.

```sql
WITH store_sales_aggregates AS (
    SELECT
        SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext1,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net1,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext2,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net2,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext3,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net3,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext4,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net4,
        SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext5,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net5
    FROM store_sales
)

    CASE WHEN cnt1 > 2972190 THEN avg_ext1 ELSE avg_net1 END AS bucket1,
    CASE WHEN cnt2 > 4505785 THEN avg_ext2 ELSE avg_net2 END AS bucket2,
    CASE WHEN cnt3 > 1575726 THEN avg_ext3 ELSE avg_net3 END AS bucket3,
    CASE WHEN cnt4 > 3188917 THEN avg_ext4 ELSE avg_net4 END AS bucket4,
    CASE WHEN cnt5 > 3525216 THEN avg_ext5 ELSE avg_net5 END AS bucket5
FROM reason
CROSS JOIN store_sales_aggregates
WHERE r_reason_sk = 1;
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (0.39x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, early_filter, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter the reason table first into a CTE, then compute all bucket aggregates from store_sales in a separate CTE, ensuring dimension filtering happens early and shared across all calculations.

```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT NULL AS placeholder
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_sk = 1
),
bucket_aggs AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 END) AS cnt1,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext1,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net1,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 END) AS cnt2,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext2,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net2,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 END) AS cnt3,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext3,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net3,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 END) AS cnt4,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext4,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net4,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 END) AS cnt5,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_sales_price END) AS avg_ext5,
        AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_profit END) AS avg_net5
    FROM store_sales

### Worker 3: aggressive_fact_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.27x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Create a pre-filtered fact CTE first, then compute all conditional aggregates from it, optimizing for fact table scan efficiency even though no join exists in the original query.

```sql
WITH filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    ss_quantity,
    ss_ext_sales_price,
    ss_net_profit,
    CASE 
      WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1
      WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 2
      WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 3
      WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 4
      WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 5
    END AS bucket_id
  FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 100
)
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 1) > 2972190
    THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 1)
    ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 1)
  END AS bucket1,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 2) > 4505785
    THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 2)
    ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 2)
  END AS bucket2,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 3) > 1575726
    THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 3)
    ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM filtered_sales WHERE bucket_id = 3)
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.39x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the CASE/WHEN logic into UNION ALL branches for each quantity range threshold condition, then use EXISTS-style logic to simulate the conditional aggregation behavior.

```sql
WITH store_sales_agg AS (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) AS cnt1,
        AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FILTER (WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) AS avg_ext1,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
