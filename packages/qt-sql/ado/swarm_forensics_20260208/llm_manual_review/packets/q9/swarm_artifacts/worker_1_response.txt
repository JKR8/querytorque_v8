Changes: Consolidated five independent store_sales scans into a single CTE using conditional aggregates, then computed final CASE logic on the pre-aggregated results. This reduces table scans from 10 (5 counts + 5 averages) to just 1.

Expected speedup: ~4-5x by eliminating redundant store_sales scans and computing all aggregates in a single pass.
