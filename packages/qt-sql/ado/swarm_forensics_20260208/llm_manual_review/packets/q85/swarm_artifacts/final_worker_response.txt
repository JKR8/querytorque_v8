**Changes**: Applied three-phase optimization: 1) Pre-joined only essential dimension tables (date_dim, reason) in initial CTE, 2) Used CASE expressions to evaluate OR conditions as boolean flags during fact table join, 3) Deferred final dimension join until after filtering to eliminate unnecessary joins for non-matching rows.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x by reducing fact table scans, enabling predicate pushdown, and minimizing join cardinality through early filtering.
