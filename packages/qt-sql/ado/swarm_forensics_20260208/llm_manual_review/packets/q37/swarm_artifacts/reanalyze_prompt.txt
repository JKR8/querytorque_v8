You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_37
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 37 in stream 0 using template query37.tpl
select i_item_id
       ,i_item_desc
       ,i_current_price
 from item, inventory, date_dim, catalog_sales
 where i_current_price between 45 and 45 + 30
 and inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
 and d_date_sk=inv_date_sk
 and d_date between cast('1999-02-21' as date) and (cast('1999-02-21' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
 and i_manufact_id in (856,707,1000,747)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
