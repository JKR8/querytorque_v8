You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

### Edges
- web_v1 → main_query
- store_v1 → main_query


## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**web_v1**: Computes daily cumulative sales for web items over a 12-month period. Scans `web_sales` (large fact table) and `date_dim` (dimension), outputs ~1k rows (item_sk, d_date, cumulative sum).

**store_v1**: Computes daily cumulative sales for store items over the same 12-month period. Scans `store_sales` (large fact table) and `date_dim` (dimension), outputs ~1k rows (item_sk, d_date, cumulative sum).

**main_query**: FULL OUTER JOINs the two CTEs, computes running maximums of cumulative sales per item/date, filters where web exceeds store, orders, and limits to 100 rows. Processes ~1k rows from each CTE.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost center is **scanning the same dimension table (`date_dim`) twice** in independent CTEs. Each CTE performs:
1. Full scan of `date_dim` with filter `d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1227`
2. Hash join with large fact tables (`web_sales`/`store_sales`)
3. Hash aggregation + window function

The **mechanism**: Duplicated dimension filtering and joining. Both CTEs apply identical date filters to `date_dim` but execute independently, causing:
- Redundant `date_dim` scans (twice)
- Redundant hash join build sides for the same filtered dimension data
- Missed opportunity to share filtered dimension results

Since CTEs are independent, DuckDB cannot push the filter optimization across CTEs, forcing complete re-execution.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1**: Extract shared date filter into a CTE
- **What**: Create `date_filtered AS (SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216+11)` and reference it in both `web_v1` and `store_v1`
- **Why**: Eliminates duplicate `date_dim` scans and redundant hash join build sides. Filter applied once, result reused.
- **Risk**: Must ensure `date_dim` filter semantics remain identical (`BETWEEN` inclusive). No change to join logic.
- **Estimated impact**: Significant (reduces dimension processing by 50%)

**Change 2**: Defer window aggregation to main query
- **What**: In CTEs, compute only daily aggregates (SUM without window). Move cumulative sum and running max to later stage.
- **Why**: Avoids computing cumulative sums for items/dates that may be filtered out after join. Reduces window function overhead.
- **Risk**: Must maintain correct NULL handling in FULL OUTER JOIN and window ordering.
- **Estimated impact**: Moderate (reduces early window computation)

**Change 3**: Convert FULL OUTER JOIN to UNION ALL + pivot
- **What**: Instead of joining, union daily aggregates with channel flag, then pivot with conditional aggregation.
- **Why**: Eliminates expensive outer join on composite key (item_sk, d_date). More efficient for sparse data.
- **Risk**: Must handle NULLs correctly when one channel lacks data for a date.
- **Estimated impact**: Moderate (avoids hash join on two CTEs)

### Recommended Approach
**Primary optimization**: Implement **shared_dimension_multi_channel** pattern. Create a pre-filtered `date_filtered` CTE containing only the 12-month date range, then join it separately with `web_sales` and `store_sales` in their respective CTEs. This eliminates duplicate dimension scanning and allows predicate pushdown.

**Secondary optimization**: Apply **early_filter** to the date dimension before any joins. The filtered date CTE should be small and can be hash-joined efficiently with both fact tables.

**Implementation steps**:
1. Create `date_filtered` CTE with `d_date_sk, d_date` for the 12-month range
2. Modify `web_v1` and `store_v1` to join with `date_filtered` instead of `date_dim`
3. Keep window functions as-is initially (simplest correctness)
4. Test for semantic equivalence (same 100-row output)

This approach directly attacks the root cause of duplicate dimension processing while maintaining query correctness.

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

FAISS picks are **excellent** for this query:

- **shared_dimension_multi_channel**: Directly addresses shared date filtering across web/store channels
- **early_filter**: Optimizes dimension table access before expensive fact joins
- **deferred_window_aggregation**: Relevant but secondary (window functions could be optimized after fixing dimension scans)

These three patterns comprehensively cover the optimization opportunities.

**EXAMPLES: shared_dimension_multi_channel, early_filter, deferred_window_aggregation**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

      from (select ss_item_sk

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
