You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

### Edges

- store_v1 → main_query


## Optimization History

### All Previous Attempts

- date_cte_isolate: REGRESSION (0.87x), reverted

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**web_v1 CTE:**
- Computes cumulative sales per item over time from web_sales for a 12-month period.
- Scans web_sales (large fact table) and date_dim (dimension), filters to ~1k rows after grouping.
- Outputs (item_sk, d_date, cume_sales) ordered by item_sk, d_date.

**store_v1 CTE:**
- Computes cumulative sales per item over time from store_sales for the same 12-month period.
- Scans store_sales (large fact table) and date_dim (dimension), filters to ~1k rows after grouping.
- Outputs (item_sk, d_date, cume_sales) ordered by item_sk, d_date.

**main_query:**
- FULL OUTER JOINs web_v1 and store_v1 on (item_sk, d_date), computes cumulative max of both sales streams, filters where web cumulative exceeds store cumulative.
- Processes ~1k rows from the join, applies two window functions, outputs top 100 rows.
- Final output ordered by item_sk, d_date.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost is **redundant full table scans and window function computations**. Both CTEs independently scan large fact tables (web_sales, store_sales) with the same date filter, perform identical grouping, and compute windowed cumulative sums. This causes:

1. **Duplicate date_dim processing**: The same date filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1227) is applied twice via joins, scanning date_dim multiple times.
2. **Premature window computation**: The cumulative sum (SUM OVER) is computed in each CTE before the join, but the main query then computes cumulative max (MAX OVER) on these results. This results in **two separate window computations per CTE** (one in CTE, one in main) with the same partitioning/ordering.
3. **Inefficient join ordering**: The current structure prevents predicate pushdown into the fact tables, forcing full scans before filtering.

The mechanism is: **Multiple passes over large fact tables with identical filters, plus redundant window function sorting on the same keys**.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Shared filtered date_dim CTE + early fact table filtering**
- **What**: Create a CTE `filtered_dates` with date_dim rows for the 12-month period, then join with fact tables in web_v1/store_v1.
- **Why**: Enables predicate pushdown, reduces fact table scans to relevant rows only, and shares date filtering logic.
- **Risk**: Must ensure NULL handling on item_sk filters remains correct.
- **Impact**: Significant (reduces largest table scans).

**Change 2: Defer window aggregation to post-join**
- **What**: Modify CTEs to compute only daily sales (GROUP BY item_sk, d_date), then compute cumulative sums and cumulative max in a single pass after the join.
- **Why**: Eliminates duplicate window computations (cumulative sum in CTE + cumulative max in main) and reduces sorting operations from three to one.
- **Risk**: Must handle NULLs correctly in FULL OUTER JOIN when computing cumulative sums separately for web/store.
- **Impact**: Moderate (reduces window function overhead).

**Change 3: Merge date filtering and fact table joins into single-pass CTEs**
- **What**: Combine filtered_dates CTE with each fact table join, removing the redundant date_dim scans.
- **Why**: Reduces join cardinality early and leverages DuckDB's join optimizations.
- **Risk**: Semantic equivalence must be preserved; the same date range must apply to both channels.
- **Impact**: Moderate (optimizes join performance).

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Previous attempt: date_cte_isolate (REGRESSION 0.87x)**
- **Why it failed**: Likely because the CTE materialization prevented join reordering or predicate pushdown that DuckDB's optimizer could otherwise achieve. Isolating date_dim into a CTE may have forced a materialized subplan that blocked efficient join strategies (e.g., hash join with fact table as probe side).
- **Lesson**: Simple CTE isolation without reconsidering the entire flow can inhibit optimizations. We need a holistic restructuring that maintains optimization opportunities while reducing redundant work.

### Recommended Approach
Implement a combined optimization that:
1. **Create a shared filtered date_dim CTE** (`filtered_dates`) containing only the 12-month range rows.
2. **Rewrite web_v1/store_v1 CTEs** to:
   - Join `filtered_dates` with the respective fact table (web_sales/store_sales) on the date key.
   - Apply the non-NULL item_sk filter.
   - Group by item_sk, d_date to compute **daily sales only** (not cumulative sums).
3. **In the main query**:
   - Perform FULL OUTER JOIN of the daily sales CTEs.
   - Compute cumulative sums (SUM OVER) for web and store sales separately in a single CTE.
   - Compute cumulative max (MAX OVER) on these cumulative sums in the same or subsequent CTE.
   - Apply filter and limit.

This approach ensures:
- Date filtering happens once and is pushed down.
- Window functions are computed only once, after the join, with a single sort per item_sk.
- The plan is more amenable to DuckDB's join optimizations.

**Implementation sketch**:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11
),
web_daily AS (
  SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d.d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates d ON ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  WHERE ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d.d_date
),
store_daily AS (
  SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d.d_date, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS daily_sales
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates d ON ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  WHERE ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY ss_item_sk, d.d_date
),
joined AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(w.item_sk, s.item_sk) AS item_sk,
    COALESCE(w.d_date, s.d_date) AS d_date,
    w.daily_sales AS web_daily,
    s.daily_sales AS store_daily
  FROM web_daily w
  FULL OUTER JOIN store_daily s
    ON w.item_sk = s.item_sk AND w.d_date = s.d_date
),
cumulative AS (
  SELECT
    item_sk,
    d_date,
    SUM(web_daily) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date
                         ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS web_cume,
    SUM(store_daily) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date
                           ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS store_cume
  FROM joined
),
final AS (
  SELECT
    item_sk,
    d_date,
    web_cume,
    store_cume,
    MAX(web_cume) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date
                        ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS web_cumulative,
    MAX(store_cume) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date
                          ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS store_cumulative
  FROM cumulative
)
SELECT *
FROM final
WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative
ORDER BY item_sk, d_date
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

**FAISS picks are appropriate**:
- `deferred_window_aggregation`: Directly addresses the redundant window functions.
- `early_filter`: Optimizes the fact table scans via predicate pushdown.
- `shared_dimension_multi_channel`: Captures sharing date_dim across multiple fact tables.

**Additional relevant examples**:
- `dimension_cte_isolate`: Similar to early_filter but for dimension tables.
- `single_pass_aggregation`: Though not directly applicable (different tables), the philosophy of consolidating passes is relevant.

**Final selection**:
```
EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, early_filter, shared_dimension_multi_channel
```

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ss_sales_price))
      over (partition by ss_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from store_sales
    ,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** When CTEs compute GROUP BY + WINDOW (running sum), then FULL OUTER JOIN introduces NULLs requiring a MAX() OVER() carry-forward pass: remove WINDOW from the CTEs (keep only GROUP BY for daily totals), join the daily totals, then compute SUM() OVER() once on the joined result. SUM() naturally skips NULLs, so the carry-forward is free. Reduces 3 WINDOW passes (2 in CTEs + 1 MAX carry-forward) to 1.

**AFTER (fast):**
[web_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM web_sales, date_dim WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
```

```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:

```
[main_query]:
```sql

```

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.
