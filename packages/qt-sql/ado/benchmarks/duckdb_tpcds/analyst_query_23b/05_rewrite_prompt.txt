You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**frequent_ss_items**: Finds store items sold frequently (>4 times) on specific dates within 2000-2003. Scans store_sales (fact), date_dim, and item (dimension). Outputs ~1k rows of (item_sk, solddate, itemdesc, count).

**max_store_sales**: Computes the maximum total sales amount per customer within 2000-2003 from store_sales. Scans store_sales, customer, and date_dim. Outputs a single row with one scalar value.

**best_ss_customer**: Identifies customers whose total store sales (across all time) exceed 95% of the maximum found in max_store_sales. Scans store_sales and customer. Outputs ~1k rows of qualifying customer_sk.

**main_query**: Aggregates sales from catalog_sales and web_sales for May 2000, filtered to frequent items and best customers. Scans two large fact tables (catalog_sales, web_sales) plus customer and date_dim. Outputs 100 rows of customer names with sales totals.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost center is the **triple scanning of store_sales** with different join patterns and aggregation levels:

1. **frequent_ss_items**: Full scan of store_sales with joins to date_dim and item
2. **max_store_sales**: Full scan of store_sales with joins to date_dim and customer  
3. **best_ss_customer**: Full scan of store_sales with join to customer

**Mechanism**: Each CTE performs a separate full table scan on the massive store_sales table (billions of rows) with overlapping date filters (years 2000-2003). The redundant scans are expensive because:
- Same date range filtering applied three times independently
- Large hash joins rebuilt three times
- No predicate pushdown optimization between CTEs

Additionally, the **best_ss_customer** CTE has a semantic inconsistency: it compares customers' lifetime sales (no date filter) against a maximum computed from 2000-2003 only. This causes an unnecessary full scan where a filtered scan could suffice if business logic permits.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
### Change 1: Single-pass store_sales aggregation with multiple grouping sets
**What**: Merge frequent_ss_items and max_store_sales into one CTE that scans store_sales once with date filtering, computing both item-date aggregates and customer aggregates.

**Why**: Eliminates two redundant scans of store_sales (~28M rows each). Single pass computes both aggregates simultaneously.

**Risk**: Must ensure grouping logic remains correct - frequent_ss_items groups by item+date, max_store_sales groups by customer.

**Impact**: Significant (reduces store_sales scans from 3 to 1)

### Change 2: Decouple best_ss_customer from date filtering inconsistency
**What**: Modify best_ss_customer to filter store_sales by the same 2000-2003 date range as max_store_sales, making the comparison semantically consistent.

**Why**: Enables reuse of the pre-aggregated customer totals from Change 1, eliminating the third store_sales scan entirely.

**Risk**: Changes business logic - now compares customer sales from 2000-2003 against maximum from same period. Must verify if lifetime comparison was intentional.

**Impact**: Moderate to significant (eliminates another full scan)

### Change 3: Pre-materialize date_dim CTE for shared filtering
**What**: Extract date_dim filtering for 2000-2003 into a reusable CTE, then join fact tables to this pre-filtered dimension.

**Why**: Reduces repeated date_dim scans and enables better predicate pushdown to fact tables.

**Risk**: Minimal - preserves exact same filtering logic.

**Impact**: Moderate (reduces dimension table processing)

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

**AFTER (fast):**
[quantity_1_20_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20
```
[quantity_21_40_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40
```
[quantity_41_60_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60
```
[quantity_61_80_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80

SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.
