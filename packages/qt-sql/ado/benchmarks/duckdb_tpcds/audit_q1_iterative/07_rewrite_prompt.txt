You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_1

  SELECT
    s_store_sk

  FROM store_returns
  JOIN date_dim
    ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN sd_stores
    ON sr_store_sk = sd_stores.s_store_sk

WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > ctr1.store_avg_return * 1.2
ORDER BY

LIMIT 100

### Edges
- sd_stores → store_customer_returns
- store_customer_returns → main_query


## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**sd_stores (CTE 0)**: Filters stores in South Dakota ('SD'), reading the entire store table but outputting only ~35 store keys.  
**store_customer_returns (CTE 1)**: For SD stores in year 2000, computes per-customer total returns and per-store average returns via window function, scanning large fact table store_returns and joining with date_dim and sd_stores, outputting ~557K rows.  
**main_query (CTE 2)**: Joins the 557K CTE rows with customer table, filters rows where customer's return exceeds 120% of store average, orders by customer_id, and outputs top 100 rows.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost (89%) is **store_customer_returns**. The mechanism is:

1. **Unnecessary window computation on full grouped result**: The CTE computes `AVG(SUM(SR_FEE)) OVER (PARTITION BY sr_store_sk)` across all ~557K grouped rows, but the main query immediately filters most away (only rows > 1.2× average pass).
2. **Inefficient window execution**: DuckDB must compute the window function across all stores before any filtering can occur, even though we only need the average for comparison.
3. **Missed predicate pushdown opportunity**: The filter `ctr_total_return > store_avg_return * 1.2` cannot be pushed into the window computation, forcing full materialization.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Split window computation into separate CTEs**
- **What**: Replace `store_customer_returns` with two CTEs: one computing per-customer totals, another computing per-store averages, then join them.
- **Why**: Avoids window function over 557K rows; enables filter pushdown to customer totals before joining with store averages.
- **Risk**: Must ensure averages are computed over same filtered dataset (SD stores, 2000).
- **Impact**: Significant (eliminates window sort/partition overhead).

**Change 2: Pre-filter fact table with dimension CTEs**
- **What**: Create filtered CTEs for both `date_dim` (d_year=2000) and `sd_stores`, then join them with `store_returns`.
- **Why**: Reduces fact table scan early; DuckDB can use efficient filtered joins.
- **Risk**: None if filters remain identical.
- **Impact**: Moderate (reduces fact table participation).

**Change 3: Materialize intermediate results**
- **What**: Use `MATERIALIZED` hint or temporary table for the per-store averages (~35 rows).
- **Why**: Store averages are tiny; materializing prevents recomputation.
- **Risk**: Extra storage, but negligible.
- **Impact**: Minor (optimizer may already cache).

### Recommended Approach
**Rewrite query to decompose the window function and push filters early**:

1. Create filtered dimension CTEs for date and store.
2. Compute per-customer totals by joining fact table with filtered dimensions.
3. Compute per-store averages from the per-customer totals (now only ~35 stores).
4. Join per-customer totals with per-store averages, applying the 1.2× filter immediately.
5. Finally join with customer table, sort, and limit.

**Implementation sketch**:
```sql
WITH sd_stores AS (SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state = 'SD'),
     year2000 AS (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000),
     customer_returns AS (
       SELECT
         sr_customer_sk,
         sr_store_sk,
         SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
       FROM store_returns
       JOIN year2000 ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
       JOIN sd_stores ON sr_store_sk = s_store_sk
       GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
     ),
     store_averages AS (
       SELECT
         sr_store_sk,
         AVG(ctr_total_return) AS store_avg_return
       FROM customer_returns
       GROUP BY sr_store_sk
     ),
     filtered_returns AS (
       SELECT
         cr.sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
         cr.sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
         cr.ctr_total_return,
         sa.store_avg_return
       FROM customer_returns cr
       JOIN store_averages sa ON cr.sr_store_sk = sa.sr_store_sk
       WHERE cr.ctr_total_return > sa.store_avg_return * 1.2
     )
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM filtered_returns
JOIN customer ON ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

FAISS picks are relevant: **deferred_window_aggregation** directly addresses the window function bottleneck; **shared_dimension_multi_channel** supports pre-filtering dimensions; **decorrelate** is less applicable (no correlated subqueries).  
I confirm these are good matches, but would also include **single_pass_aggregation** since we're consolidating the fact table scan.

**EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, shared_dimension_multi_channel, single_pass_aggregation**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,

  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date

     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** When CTEs compute GROUP BY + WINDOW (running sum), then FULL OUTER JOIN introduces NULLs requiring a MAX() OVER() carry-forward pass: remove WINDOW from the CTEs (keep only GROUP BY for daily totals), join the daily totals, then compute SUM() OVER() once on the joined result. SUM() naturally skips NULLs, so the carry-forward is free. Reduces 3 WINDOW passes (2 in CTEs + 1 MAX carry-forward) to 1.

```

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
