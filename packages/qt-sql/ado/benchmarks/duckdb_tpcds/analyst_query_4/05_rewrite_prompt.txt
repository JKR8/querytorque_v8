You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**year_total CTE**: Aggregates yearly sales totals per customer across three sales channels (store, catalog, web). It joins the large fact tables (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales) with customer and date_dim, groups by all customer attributes plus year, and calculates a complex revenue formula. Outputs approximately thousands of rows per sales channel per year (likely millions total).

**main_query**: Performs a 6-way self-join on the year_total CTE to compare each customer's sales growth across channels between 1999 and 2000. Filters for specific years and sale types, requires positive first-year sales, and compares growth ratios. Outputs at most 100 customers meeting the growth conditions.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost is the **year_total CTE** computing aggregates across *all years* only to be filtered to 2 years later. The mechanism is:
1. **Premature full-channel aggregation**: Each UNION branch performs a full table scan of massive sales tables (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales) and aggregates across all years, when only 1999-2000 data is needed.
2. **Repeated dimension joins**: Customer and date_dim are joined three times separately, once per channel, with no predicate pushdown.
3. **Explosive 6-way self-join**: The main query self-joins the CTE six times on customer_id, creating a Cartesian-like explosion (O(n⁶) worst case) before filtering by year/sale_type.

The root cause: **Failure to push year filters into the fact table scans**, causing massive unnecessary aggregation. The UNION_ALL structure prevents predicate pushdown across channels.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Pre-filter date_dim and push into UNION branches**
- **What**: Create a filtered date_dim CTE with only 1999-2000, then join it in each UNION branch.
- **Why**: Reduces fact table joins by ~98% (assuming uniform year distribution). Enables partition pruning if date_dim is partitioned.
- **Risk**: Must ensure date_dim filtering matches exact year logic (1999 AND 2000 needed for both first/secyear comparisons).
- **Impact**: Significant (50-70% reduction in scanned rows).

**Change 2: Split year_total into separate CTEs by sale_type before filtering**
- **What**: Create three separate CTEs (store_year, catalog_year, web_year) with year filters applied within each.
- **Why**: Allows optimizer to push year filters directly into each fact table scan. Eliminates scanning irrelevant years.
- **Risk**: Must maintain correct UNION semantics for the self-join pattern.
- **Impact**: Significant (further 50% reduction per channel).

**Change 3: Pivot year totals in CTE to avoid 6-way self-join**
- **What**: Restructure year_total to output columns: customer_id, store_1999, store_2000, catalog_1999, catalog_2000, web_1999, web_2000.
- **Why**: Replaces 6-way self-join with single row per customer. Eliminates exponential join explosion.
- **Risk**: Complex restructuring; must handle NULLs for customers missing certain channel-year combinations correctly.
- **Impact**: Moderate to significant (reduces join complexity from O(n⁶) to O(n)).

### Recommended Approach
**Implement a hybrid approach**:
1. **Create filtered_date CTE**: `SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_year IN (1999, 2000)`
2. **Create channel-specific CTEs**: Build three CTEs that join customer, filtered_date, and respective sales table, aggregating by customer_id and d_year only (drop unnecessary customer attributes).
3. **Pivot within main query**: Use conditional aggregation to create columns for each channel-year combination, then apply the growth comparison logic.

**Implementation sketch**:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim 
  WHERE d_year IN (1999, 2000)
),
store_totals AS (
  SELECT c_customer_id, d_year,
    SUM(((ss_ext_list_price - ss_ext_wholesale_cost - ss_ext_discount_amt) + ss_ext_sales_price)/2) AS total
  FROM customer 
  JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
  JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  GROUP BY c_customer_id, d_year
),
-- Repeat for catalog_sales, web_sales with similar patterns
pivoted AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN channel='s' AND year=1999 THEN total END) as s_1999,
    MAX(CASE WHEN channel='s' AND year=2000 THEN total END) as s_2000,
    -- ... similarly for c_1999, c_2000, w_1999, w_2000
  FROM (
    SELECT c_customer_id as customer_id, 's' as channel, d_year as year, total FROM store_totals
    UNION ALL SELECT c_customer_id, 'c', d_year, total FROM catalog_totals
    UNION ALL SELECT c_customer_id, 'w', d_year, total FROM web_totals
  )
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, c_birth_country
FROM pivoted p
JOIN customer c ON c.c_customer_id = p.customer_id
WHERE s_1999 > 0 AND c_1999 > 0 AND w_1999 > 0
  AND c_2000/c_1999 > s_2000/s_1999
  AND c_2000/c_1999 > w_2000/w_1999
ORDER BY customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, c_birth_country
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

The FAISS picks are relevant but incomplete:
- **union_cte_split**: Highly relevant - splitting the UNION into separate CTEs enables predicate pushdown.
- **intersect_to_exists**: Not directly applicable (no INTERSECT in query).
- **shared_dimension_multi_channel**: Relevant - extracting shared dimension (date_dim) filtering.

**Better examples**:
- **early_filter**: Critical - filtering date_dim early before joining fact tables.
- **single_pass_aggregation**: Relevant - could consolidate multiple year aggregates.
- **pushdown**: Essential - pushing year filters into UNION branches.

**EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, early_filter, single_pass_aggregation**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

```

**Key insight:** The original query scans the generic wswscs CTE twice and joins to date_dim twice to filter by year. By pushing year filters INTO the CTE definition, we create specialized CTEs (wswscs_1998, wswscs_1999) that filter during aggregation instead of after. This eliminates redundant date_dim lookups and reduces the rows aggregated.

            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.
