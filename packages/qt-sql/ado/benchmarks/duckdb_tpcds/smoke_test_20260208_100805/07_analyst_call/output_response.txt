WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables before joining with large fact tables, push predicates into CTEs, and materialize intermediate results to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered date and item dimensions into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reuse filtered dimension sets before joining with fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter both dimension tables into CTEs, then pre-join them with the fact table in a staged CTE to minimize intermediate data, and consolidate computations.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform query structure by splitting potential OR conditions, converting set operations to EXISTS patterns, and decorrelating any hidden subquery patterns for better join planning.
