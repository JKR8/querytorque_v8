Changes: Isolated date filtering (1999/1998) and item dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs, then split the UNION by channel and year to create 6 separate CTEs (catalog/store/web for each year) before final aggregation. This enables predicate pushdown and reduces the cardinality of intermediate results.
Expected speedup: 2-3x through reduced data movement and earlier filtering.
