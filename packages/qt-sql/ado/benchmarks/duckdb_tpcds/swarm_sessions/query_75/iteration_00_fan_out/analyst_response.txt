WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs early, filtering dimension tables before joins, and materializing repeated patterns to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, union_cte_split
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown, and split the UNION CTE by channel to optimize per-branch filtering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts in separate CTEs, then consolidate aggregation passes to minimize intermediate data and join costs.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Apply structural query transformations—convert patterns to EXISTS, split OR conditions into UNION ALL, and decorrelate complex subqueries—to enable alternative join planning.
