You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_1

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE
    sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. customer_total_return
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Stats**: 85% Cost | ~557k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return]
**Dependencies**: store_returns, date_dim (join)
**Joins**: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2000
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
  SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE
  sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY
  sr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk
```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Stats**: 13% Cost | ~539k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, CORRELATED_SUBQUERY(ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk), ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_customer_id] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery)
**Joins**: s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk | ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
**Filters**: ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk) | s_state = 'SD'
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[customer], CTE_SCAN, SEQ_SCAN[store], COLUMN_DATA_SCAN, CTE_SCAN
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**customer_total_return CTE**: Computes total return fees for each customer-store combination in the year 2000. It joins store_returns (~likely millions of rows) with date_dim (~thousands) and groups by customer+store, outputting ~557k aggregated rows.

**main_query**: Finds customers in SD stores whose total return exceeds 120% of their store's average return. It scans the CTE twice (once for main rows, once per store in correlated subquery), joins with store and customer tables, processes ~539k rows, and outputs the top 100 customer IDs ordered.

### Performance Bottleneck
**Dominant cost**: The CTE `customer_total_return` at 85% cost, but the **real mechanism** is the **correlated subquery execution pattern**. For each of the ~539k CTE rows (after store filtering), DuckDB re-evaluates the subquery `AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2` by scanning the entire CTE again filtered only by matching `ctr_store_sk`. This creates O(n²) behavior: each store's average is computed repeatedly as the outer loop iterates through customers of that store.

**Secondary issue**: The CTE computes returns for **all stores**, but the main query only needs stores in 'SD'. This unnecessary computation inflates the CTE size before filtering.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Decorrelate the subquery into a separate pre-aggregated CTE**
- **What**: Create `store_avg_return` CTE with `ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) as store_avg`, then JOIN instead of using correlated subquery.
- **Why**: Eliminates repeated scanning/computation of store averages. Each store's average is computed once.
- **Risk**: Must ensure we only include stores that pass the s_state='SD' filter to maintain correctness.
- **Impact**: Significant (3-5x expected)

**Change 2: Push store filter into CTE computation**
- **What**: Join store table early in the CTE to filter by s_state='SD' before aggregation.
- **Why**: Reduces CTE cardinality from ~557k to only SD stores, shrinking hash tables and subsequent joins.
- **Risk**: The subquery average must be computed over the same filtered set (SD stores only), which matches original semantics since outer query only considers SD stores.
- **Impact**: Moderate (1.5-2x)

**Change 3: Materialize CTE explicitly**
- **What**: Add `MATERIALIZED` hint or restructure to prevent recomputation of CTE for subquery.
- **Why**: DuckDB may inline CTEs, causing recomputation. Materialization ensures single computation.
- **Risk**: Materialization increases memory usage but reduces CPU.
- **Impact**: Minor (1.2-1.5x)

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Previous attempt "unknown → WIN (1.85x)"**: Likely attempted materialization or basic decorrelation but didn't address the store filtering pushdown. The 1.85x improvement suggests partial decorrelation but still computing averages over all stores unnecessarily.

**Constraint learned**: Any optimization must preserve that store averages are computed **per store** and compared against **individual customer returns** for that same store. Filtering stores must happen consistently across both comparisons.

### Recommended Approach
Implement a **three-CTE rewrite**:
1. `sd_stores`: Pre-filter store table for s_state='SD' 
2. `customer_store_returns`: Join store_returns → date_dim → sd_stores, aggregate by customer+store
3. `store_avg_returns`: Aggregate customer_store_returns by store to get averages
4. Main query: JOIN customer_store_returns → store_avg_returns → customer, filter where return > avg * 1.2

This eliminates correlation, reduces CTE size via early filtering, and ensures single computation of aggregates.

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

The FAISS picks are partially relevant:
- **decorrelate**: Directly addresses the correlated subquery → **HIGH RELEVANCE**
- **materialize_cte**: Could help but addresses symptom, not root cause → **MEDIUM RELEVANCE**
- **union_cte_split**: Not relevant for this query pattern

More relevant examples:
- **early_filter**: For pushing store filter down
- **dimension_cte_isolate**: For isolating store dimension filtering
- **single_pass_aggregation**: For computing store averages in one pass

**EXAMPLES: decorrelate, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
