```sql
WITH filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    ss_net_profit,
    s_state,
    s_county
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11
),
top_states AS (
  SELECT 
    s_state,
    SUM(ss_net_profit) AS state_total
  FROM filtered_sales
  GROUP BY s_state
  ORDER BY state_total DESC
  LIMIT 5
)
SELECT
  SUM(ss_net_profit) AS total_sum,
  s_state,
  s_county,
  GROUPING(s_state) + GROUPING(s_county) AS lochierarchy,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY GROUPING(s_state) + GROUPING(s_county), CASE WHEN GROUPING(s_county) = 0 THEN s_state END
    ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) DESC
  ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM filtered_sales
WHERE s_state IN (SELECT s_state FROM top_states)
GROUP BY ROLLUP(s_state, s_county)
ORDER BY
  lochierarchy DESC,
  CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END,
  rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100
```

Changes: Consolidated multiple store_sales scans into a single filtered CTE and transformed the correlated subquery into a standalone CTE with LIMIT 5 for top states, then joined via IN clause.

Expected speedup: ~2.5x by eliminating duplicate fact table scans and simplifying the state filtering logic.
