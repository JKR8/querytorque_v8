WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters into CTEs and applying early reduction to dimension tables before joining to the fact table, using materialization to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with store_sales, enabling predicate pushdown and better join optimization across all dimensions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter multiple dimensions, then pre-join with fact table in staged CTEs before final aggregation, consolidating scans into single-pass operations where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_restructuring
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches to enable separate optimization paths, then restructure using CTE splitting and decorrelation techniques for maximal plan flexibility.
