**Changes**: 
1. Created a filtered_dates CTE to isolate date_dim filtering.
2. Created a store_sales_filtered CTE to pre-join store_sales with filtered dates.
3. Split the OR conditions on demographics into three separate UNION ALL branches.
4. Within each branch, kept the OR conditions on addresses intact since they're on the same column (ca_state) and can be optimized within each branch.
5. Used explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and optimizer flexibility.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x. The rewrite transforms complex OR conditions into separate optimization paths via UNION ALL branches, allowing each branch to use appropriate indexes and join orders for its specific filters. The date filter is pushed early to reduce the fact table scan size.
