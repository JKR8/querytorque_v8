Changes: Created filtered CTEs for date_dim (years 2001-2002) and item (color/price filters), converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pushed these filters early into the main cross_sales computation to reduce join cardinality.
Expected speedup: ~2x from reduced intermediate row counts and better join ordering.
