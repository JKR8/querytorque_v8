WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe filter pushdowns into CTEs and materialize intermediate results to reduce join sizes early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining to fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure query with multiple specialized CTEs and consolidate aggregations into single passes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, decorrelate
HINT: Apply structural transformations like converting patterns to EXISTS/UNION and decorrelating subqueries.
