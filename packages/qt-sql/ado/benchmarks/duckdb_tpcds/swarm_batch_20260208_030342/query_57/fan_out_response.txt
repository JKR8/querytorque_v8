WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply aggressive early filtering to dimension tables (especially date_dim with complex OR conditions) before joins, and push outer filters into CTEs to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, materialize_cte
HINT: Isolate all dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, and materialize shared dimension patterns to avoid repeated computation across the query.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables early, then perform window operations on pre-aggregated results. Restructure the self-join in v2 using window functions (LAG/LEAD) instead of explicit joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform the OR conditions on date_dim into UNION ALL branches for better predicate pushdown, and explore restructuring the self-join pattern using EXISTS logic or splitting the CTE by date ranges.
