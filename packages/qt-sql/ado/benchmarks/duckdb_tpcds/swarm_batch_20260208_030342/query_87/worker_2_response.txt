Changes: Isolated date_dim and customer tables into dedicated CTEs with only required columns, then performed explicit joins with each fact table. This enables predicate pushdown on date_dim (month filter) and creates small dimension hash tables that are reused across all three sales channels.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x from reduced dimension scanning and better join selectivity.
