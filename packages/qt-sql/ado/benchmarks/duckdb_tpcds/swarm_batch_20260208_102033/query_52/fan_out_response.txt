WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply standard optimizations - filter dimension tables first to reduce join sizes, push predicates down, and use CTEs for readability without risking plan changes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date_dim, item) into separate CTEs before joining to store_sales to enable predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate results.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs, then pre-join with fact table early, and consider consolidating operations to minimize passes over large fact tables.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural transformations even without matching patterns - consider converting implied operations, testing EXISTS alternatives, or splitting/combining query parts differently.
