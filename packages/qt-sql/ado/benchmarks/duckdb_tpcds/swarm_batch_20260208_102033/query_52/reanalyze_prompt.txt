You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_52
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 52 in stream 0 using template query52.tpl
select dt.d_year
 	,item.i_brand_id brand_id
 	,item.i_brand brand
 	,sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
 from date_dim dt
     ,store_sales
     ,item
 where dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
    and store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    and item.i_manager_id = 1
    and dt.d_moy=12
    and dt.d_year=2002
 group by dt.d_year
 	,item.i_brand
 	,item.i_brand_id
 order by dt.d_year
 	,ext_price desc
 	,brand_id
 LIMIT 100;

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filtering
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply standard optimizations - filter dimension tables first to reduce join sizes, push predicates down, and use CTEs for readability without risking plan changes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2002
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
)
SELECT
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,
    fi.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
    fd.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date_dim, item) into separate CTEs before joining to store_sales to enable predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate results.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2002
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
)
SELECT
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,
    fi.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
    fd.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs, then pre-join with fact table early, and consider consolidating operations to minimize passes over large fact tables.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2002
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT ss.ss_item_sk, ss.ss_ext_sales_price, fd.d_year
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
)
SELECT
    fs.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(fs.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM filtered_sales fs
JOIN filtered_items fi ON fs.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fs.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,
    fi.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
    fs.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.92x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore structural transformations even without matching patterns - consider converting implied operations, testing EXISTS alternatives, or splitting/combining query parts differently.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2002
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
)
SELECT
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,
    fi.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
    fd.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (1.07x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2002
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
)
SELECT
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items fi ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fd.d_year,
    fi.i_brand,
    fi.i_brand_id
ORDER BY
    fd.d_year,
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
