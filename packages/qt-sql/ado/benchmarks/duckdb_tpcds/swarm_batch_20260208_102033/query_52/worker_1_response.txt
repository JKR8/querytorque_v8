**Changes:** Converted implicit joins to explicit joins and created two CTEs to filter dimension tables (`date_dim` and `item`) before joining with the large `store_sales` fact table. This pushes filters down early and reduces the join sizes.

**Expected speedup:** 1.2-1.5x (conservative estimate). The rewrite follows the "early_filter" pattern by reducing the fact table scan to only rows matching the pre-filtered dimensions, which should significantly reduce the amount of data processed during the join and aggregation.
