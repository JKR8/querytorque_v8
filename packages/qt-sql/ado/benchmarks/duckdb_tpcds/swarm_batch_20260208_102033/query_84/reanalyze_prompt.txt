You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_84
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 84 in stream 0 using template query84.tpl
select c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_reduction
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply filters to dimension tables first and push predicates down early; use CTE materialization for filtered dimension sets to reduce join sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Oakwood'
),
filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 5806
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 5806 + 50000
),
filtered_household AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    JOIN filtered_income_band ON ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk

filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT 
        c_customer_id,

        c_current_hdemo_sk
    FROM customer
    JOIN filtered_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk

-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 2: dimension_isolation_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and isolate all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

```sql
WITH filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Oakwood'
),
filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 5806
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 5806 + 50000
),

    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    JOIN filtered_income_band ON ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
),

    JOIN filtered_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_household_demographics ON c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_fact_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables early; consolidate multiple filtering passes into single CTEs with combined logic.

```sql
WITH filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 5806
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 5806 + 50000
),
filtered_household AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk, hd_income_band_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    INNER JOIN filtered_income_band 
        ON household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk = filtered_income_band.ib_income_band_sk
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Oakwood'
),
prejoined_customer AS (
    SELECT 
        c_customer_id,
        c_current_cdemo_sk,
        c_last_name,

        c_current_hdemo_sk,
        c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    INNER JOIN filtered_customer_address 
        ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = filtered_customer_address.ca_address_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_household 
        ON customer.c_current_hdemo_sk = filtered_household.hd_demo_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.26x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure using set operation rewrites and decorrelation patterns, even if not directly present, to inspire alternative join approaches.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Oakwood'

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
