**Changes**: 
1. Created a shared `filtered_dates` CTE for date conditions used across all sales channels.
2. Transformed the OR between web_sales and catalog_sales into a UNION of distinct customers in a `multi_channel_customers` CTE.
3. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
4. Kept EXISTS semantics to preserve short-circuiting and avoid materialization overhead.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x from reduced date_dim scans and optimized OR evaluation via UNION.
