WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables (customer_address, customer_demographics) first and push date filters into subqueries early to reduce join volumes, then materialize intermediate results.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Pre-filter date_dim (year=2001, qoy<4) into a shared CTE, then pre-filter customer dimensions into separate CTEs before joining with sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_decorrelate_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, composite_decorrelate_union, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Decorrelate EXISTS subqueries by pre-joining each sales channel with filtered date_dim into CTEs, then union distinct customer keys before joining with main dimensions.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Transform the OR between web_sales and catalog_sales into a UNION ALL of distinct customers, then use EXISTS with a shared date CTE; consider intersect semantics for multi-channel.
