You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_and_materialization
- **Status**: pass (1.74x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, materialize_cte, early_filter
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing date/item filters deeper into CTEs and materializing repeated subqueries to avoid redundant computation. Keep structure similar but reduce intermediate result sizes through early filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2002
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id
  FROM (
    SELECT iss.i_brand_id, iss.i_class_id, iss.i_category_id
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN item iss ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk
    JOIN filtered_date d1 ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
    INTERSECT
    SELECT ics.i_brand_id, ics.i_class_id, ics.i_category_id
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN item ics ON catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk
    JOIN filtered_date d2 ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk

    AND item.i_category_id = filtered_items.i_category_id
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.62x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, dimension_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date filtering and dimension pre-filtering into reusable CTEs before joins. Share common dimension filters across sales channels to reduce redundant scanning.

```sql
WITH date_range AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim 
  WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
),

```

### Worker 3: aggressive_consolidation_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Consolidate multiple sales table scans into single-pass CTEs with conditional aggregation. Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact data early to reduce join cardinality.

-- start query 14 in stream 0 using template query14.tpl

- **Error**: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "ss_item_sk" (use: "store_sales.ss_item_sk" or "ci.ss_item_sk")
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, decorrelate, or_to_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform INTERSECT operations to EXISTS/JOIN patterns for better optimizer planning. Decorrelate subqueries and convert OR conditions to UNION ALL for selective execution.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
