WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs early, ensuring predicate pushdown to reduce join sizes, and materializing reusable subresults.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, item) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table to improve plan clarity and enable parallel filtering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_join_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Restructure joins by prefetching filtered dimension-fact combinations, consolidate aggregations into single passes, and defer window computations to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Apply structural query transformations by splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, converting INTERSECT patterns, and decorrelating complex subqueries for better join planning.
