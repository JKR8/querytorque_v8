Changes: Decorrelated the repeated IN subquery into a CTE, extracted filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This allows better join planning and reuse of filtered dimension tables across all three sales channels.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from eliminating repeated subquery execution and enabling parallel dimension table filtering.
