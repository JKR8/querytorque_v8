WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables before joining to fact tables, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize repeated subquery patterns to reduce redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate date and other dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown, then pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in a controlled sequence.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join them with the fact table in CTEs, consolidate multiple aggregations into a single pass, and defer window computations to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, decorrelate
HINT: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches, decorrelate multiple subqueries into pre-materialized CTEs, and convert correlated subqueries to joins for better parallelism.
