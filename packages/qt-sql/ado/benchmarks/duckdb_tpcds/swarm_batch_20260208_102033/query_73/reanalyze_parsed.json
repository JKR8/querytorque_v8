  "failure_analysis": "All workers relied heavily on dimension-table pre-filtering CTEs, which DuckDB's optimizer already implements automatically through predicate pushdown and join reordering. The minimal speedups (1.02x-1.12x) indicate:\n1. **Overhead of forced CTE materialization**: DuckDB's optimizer is already pushing filters down; materializing filtered dimension tables adds unnecessary intermediate result spooling without reducing the main bottleneck\u2014the massive store_sales fact table.\n2. **Missing fact-table reduction**: None of the attempts aggressively reduce store_sales rows BEFORE joins. The filters on date, store, and household_demographics are selective, but store_sales is still scanned entirely before applying join conditions.\n3. **Inefficient OR handling**: Worker 4's UNION ALL for hd_buy_potential added overhead without benefit\u2014the condition is low-selectivity on a small dimension table.\n4. **Group-by cardinality unchanged**: All attempts perform aggregation on the same (ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk) combination after full joins, missing opportunities to pre-aggregate fact data using dimension keys.",
  "unexplored": "1. **Early fact-table pruning**: Use dimension keys to filter store_sales via semi-joins or bloom filters before the main join.\n2. **Two-phase aggregation**: Pre-aggregate store_sales by dimension-compatible keys (ss_sold_date_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_hdemo_sk), then join to dimension tables for final grouping.\n3. **Materialized bitmask filtering**: Pre-compute qualifying dimension keys and use them as a filter condition directly on store_sales.\n4. **Lateral join pattern**: Use a correlated subquery to filter store_sales rows per qualifying dimension combination.\n5. **Aggregation pushdown into join**: Perform counting during the join process rather than after full materialization.",
  "refined_strategy": "Implement **fact-first two-phase aggregation**:\n1. Pre-compute qualifying dimension key sets as integer arrays.\n2. Use these arrays to filter store_sales via IN-list predicates before any joins.\n3. Perform partial aggregation on store_sales using dimension foreign keys.\n4. Complete the aggregation after lightweight dimension lookups.\nThis reduces the fact table scan cost and avoids materializing large intermediate joins.",
