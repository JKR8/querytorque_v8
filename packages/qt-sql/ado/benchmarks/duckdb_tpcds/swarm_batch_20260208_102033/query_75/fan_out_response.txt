WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into the UNION subqueries early, materialize the CTE to avoid re-scanning, and apply predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate data volume.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and item dimension filtering into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling predicate pushdown and shared dimension reuse across all sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_union_restructure
EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Split the UNION into separate CTEs per sales channel, pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables, and consider consolidating aggregations into a single pass where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, decorrelate, or_to_union
HINT: Transform the self-join pattern using EXISTS logic, decorrelate the year comparison, and restructure ratio conditions using UNION ALL branches for better join planning.
