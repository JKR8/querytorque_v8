## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.12x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into the UNION subqueries early, materialize the CTE to avoid re-scanning, and apply predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate data volume.

### Worker 3: aggressive_union_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.40x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: union_cte_split, single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Split the UNION into separate CTEs per sales channel, pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables, and consider consolidating aggregations into a single pass where possible.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
