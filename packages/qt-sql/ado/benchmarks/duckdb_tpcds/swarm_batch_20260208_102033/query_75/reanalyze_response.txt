FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts focused on dimension filtering and UNION restructuring but missed the core bottleneck: excessive LEFT JOIN operations on large returns tables across all channels. Worker 3's pre-aggregation approach showed promise (1.49x) but still performed three separate joins to returns tables. The root issue is the query pattern "sales minus returns" which forces expensive one-to-many joins for each channel. DuckDB cannot efficiently push aggregation through these joins, resulting in massive intermediate rows before grouping. All attempts treated the three channels symmetrically, missing opportunities to leverage their different cardinalities and return rates.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Returns pre-aggregation**: Aggregate returns by (order/item) before joining, reducing join cardinality.
2. **Asymmetric optimization**: Handle each sales channel differently based on data distribution.
3. **Window function elimination**: Replace the self-join year comparison with LAG() window function.
4. **Early pruning with approximate ratios**: Use COUNT-based filters before expensive decimal divisions.
5. **Materialized filtered returns**: Create a single returns CTE filtered by category to avoid redundant item joins.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
1. **Pre-aggregate returns** for each channel by (order_number, item_sk) into counts/amounts before joining.
2. **Use LAG() window function** to eliminate the self-join entirely, comparing years within a single scan.
3. **Apply early ratio pruning** using integer comparisons (sales_cnt*10 < prev_sales_cnt*9) to avoid decimal casting.
4. **Consolidate returns filtering** into a single CTE that joins returns with filtered items once.
5. **Use UNION ALL with channel-specific optimizations**: catalog_sales (largest) gets most aggressive returns pre-aggregation.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate, early_filter, pushdown
HINT: Transform the self-join to window LAG, pre-aggregate returns by key before joining, use integer ratio comparison to avoid decimal overhead, and handle each sales channel with tailored optimization levels.
