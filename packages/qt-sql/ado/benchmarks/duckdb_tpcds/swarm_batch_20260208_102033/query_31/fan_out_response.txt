WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early to reduce intermediate data volume, apply predicate pushdown to dimension joins, and consider materializing CTEs for reuse in the multi-instance self-join.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter date_dim and customer_address into isolated CTEs before joining with fact tables, then share these filtered dimensions across both store and web sales CTEs to eliminate redundant filtering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure the quarter comparisons using conditional aggregation in a single CTE pass instead of six self-joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform the complex self-join pattern using UNION-based rewrites, explore EXISTS for quarter progression logic, and decorrelate any implied dependencies between store and web sales comparisons.
