  "failure_analysis": "All workers attempted CTE restructuring and early filtering but missed the fundamental bottleneck: the UNION ALL of two massive fact tables without any date filtering creates an enormous intermediate result (wscs) that dominates query cost. Worker 3 attempted prefetch joins but incorrectly split the union, causing redundant joins. Worker 4's single-pass aggregation still performed the union before aggregation. Worker 5 regressed by materializing separate CTEs for each year without pushing filters into fact tables. The core issue is that the original plan performs UNION\u2192JOIN\u2192AGGREGATE, while optimal execution requires JOIN\u2192UNION\u2192AGGREGATE with early fact table reduction.",
  "unexplored": "1. **Early fact table reduction via derived tables**: Push date_dim filters directly into correlated subqueries within the UNION ALL branches before unioning.\n2. **Fact table pruning using date_dim join**: Use semi-joins or derived tables to filter fact tables by year before union.\n3. **Materialized view pattern**: Pre-aggregate sales by (sold_date_sk, channel) if indexes exist.\n4. **Dynamic predicate pushdown**: Use CASE statements to embed year logic within a single pass over date_dim.\n5. **Columnar compression exploitation**: Leverage DuckDB's ability to push filters through unions via query restructuring.",
  "refined_strategy": "Restructure the query to perform date_dim filtering and joining BEFORE the UNION ALL operation. Create two pre-joined CTEs (web_sales_joined, catalog_sales_joined) that filter fact rows to only dates in 1998-1999 via inner join with a filtered date_dim CTE. Then union these pre-joined results and aggregate once. Finally, use a single-pass conditional aggregation to compute both years' metrics in one CTE, eliminating the self-join.",
