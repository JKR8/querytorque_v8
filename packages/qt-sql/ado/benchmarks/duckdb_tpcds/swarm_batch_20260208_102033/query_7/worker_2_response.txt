**Changes:** Isolated three filtered dimensions (customer_demographics, date_dim, promotion) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling independent predicate pushdown and creating small hash tables for efficient fact table probing. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup:** 1.5-2x. This follows the successful pattern from the dimension_cte_isolate example (1.93x) by creating small filtered dimension sets that reduce the fact table join early.
