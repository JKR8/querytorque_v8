```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11
), filtered_web_sales AS (
  SELECT ws_item_sk, ws_net_paid
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
)
SELECT
  SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
  i_category,
  i_class,
  GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class), 
                 CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
    ORDER BY SUM(ws_net_paid) DESC
  ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM filtered_web_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk

```

**Changes**: Applied multi-dimension prefetch by creating two CTEs: first filters date_dim on the selective d_month_seq range, second pre-joins filtered dates with web_sales to reduce fact table scan before the final join with item and ROLLUP aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0x-3.0x by reducing the web_sales scan to only rows matching the 12-month date range and avoiding repeated filtering during the ROLLUP computation.
