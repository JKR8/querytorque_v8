WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filtering
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs, materializing repeated patterns, and filtering dimension tables early to reduce join sizes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date and store dimension filtering into separate CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce redundant joins across channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_single_pass_prefetch
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Consolidate multiple scans into single-pass aggregation, pre-filter dimensions, and pre-join with facts to minimize intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Explore alternative join structures by converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, transforming intersect patterns to EXISTS, and deferring window computations.
