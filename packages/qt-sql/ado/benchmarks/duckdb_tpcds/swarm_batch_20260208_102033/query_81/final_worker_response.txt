**Changes**: 
1. Isolated CA customers into a CTE with all required customer/address columns.
2. Created filtered CTE for 2002 dates.
3. Combined per-customer returns aggregation with state-average calculation using a window function in a single pass.
4. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by reducing fact table joins through early dimension filtering and eliminating correlated subquery overhead.
