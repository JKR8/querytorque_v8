You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters into CTEs early and materializing repeated subqueries. Keep the original structure but improve filter application order.

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca_state AS ctr_state,
    SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM catalog_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN customer_address ON cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2002
  GROUP BY
    cr_returning_customer_sk,
    ca_state

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: fail (2.28x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate dimension table filtering (date_dim, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining to reduce fact table scans and enable better predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_ca_addresses AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_state
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_state = 'CA'
),
customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca_state AS ctr_state,

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Values list "ca" does not have a column named "ca_street_number"

LINE 27:     ca.ca_street_number,
             ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with fact tables in CTEs. Consolidate multiple scans into single-pass aggregations where possible.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002

### Worker 4: novel_decorrelation_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the correlated subquery using decorrelation techniques. Explore converting the state-based comparison to a JOIN with pre-aggregated averages, potentially using UNION patterns.

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca_state AS ctr_state,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
