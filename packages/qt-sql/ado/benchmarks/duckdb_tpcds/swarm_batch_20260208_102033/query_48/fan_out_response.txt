WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates down, and materializing reusable filtered dimension sets.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling predicate pushdown and reducing join cardinality early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Restructure joins to pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact data in CTEs, then perform final aggregation in a single pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_restructuring
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches and apply advanced structural transformations to enable better index usage and join planning.
