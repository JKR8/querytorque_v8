  "failure_analysis": "All attempts fell short because they failed to address the core bottleneck: the three-way join between large fact tables (store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales) with multi-key equality conditions (customer_sk, item_sk, ticket_number). The CTE-based approaches merely reshuffled the same joins without fundamentally changing the join strategy. Worker 4's ambiguous column error highlights the complexity of manually managing aliases in multi-join CTE chains. Worker 2's 1.04x speedup suggests slight improvement from early dimension filtering, but the 0.98x and 0.97x results indicate CTE materialization overhead sometimes outweighs benefits. The real issue is combinatorial explosion from joining three large fact tables before aggregation.",
  "unexplored": "1. **single_pass_aggregation** - Compute aggregates per fact table separately before joining, reducing join cardinality dramatically\n2. **union_cte_split** - Handle store_returns and catalog_sales as independent branches then combine\n3. **composite_decorrelate_union** - Transform the implicit correlation between sales channels into explicit pre-aggregated sets\n4. **deferred_window_aggregation** - Not directly applicable, but suggests staging aggregates before final combination\n5. **OR condition elimination** - d2 and d3 have identical filters ('2001Q1','2001Q2','2001Q3'), allowing reuse of one filtered date set",
  "refined_strategy": "Pre-aggregate each sales channel independently at the lowest granularity (item_id, store_id), then join the aggregated results instead of raw fact tables. Specifically:\n1. Create a base CTE with all relevant items and stores from store_sales (filtered by d1 dates)\n2. Compute store_sales aggregates grouped by (item_id, store_id, state) in CTE1\n3. Compute store_returns aggregates grouped by (item_id, customer_sk, ticket_number) in CTE2, then roll up to (item_id, store_id) using the base CTE\n4. Compute catalog_sales aggregates grouped by (item_id, customer_sk) in CTE3, then roll up similarly\n5. Join the three aggregated results on item_id and store_id\nThis transforms O(N\u00b3) join complexity to O(3N) aggregation + O(N) join where N is filtered fact rows.",

  "hint": "Use a scaffold CTE from filtered store_sales (with item_id, store_id, state) as the driving set, then LEFT JOIN to pre-aggregated returns and catalog aggregates. Ensure each aggregation CTE includes the necessary join keys to connect back to the scaffold."
