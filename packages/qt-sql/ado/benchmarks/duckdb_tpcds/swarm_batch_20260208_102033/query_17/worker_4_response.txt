**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and pre-filtered date dimensions into separate CTEs using the **decorrelate** pattern. This allows early reduction of date_dim rows before the multi-way fact table joins.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x from reducing join complexity and enabling better join order optimization by isolating dimension filters.
