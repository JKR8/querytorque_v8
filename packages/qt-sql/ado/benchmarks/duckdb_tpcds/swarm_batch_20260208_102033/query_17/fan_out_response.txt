WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, incremental improvements by aggressively filtering dimension tables first, pushing filters into CTEs, and materializing repeated patterns to reduce intermediate data volume early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Restructure by isolating each filtered dimension (date, store, item) into separate CTEs before joining to facts, enabling better predicate pushdown and join planning for multi-date scenarios.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with their respective fact tables in staged CTEs, then combine channel results, optimizing for shared dimension filters across sales channels.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Apply non-traditional structural transformations: convert implicit OR logic in joins to UNION ALL branches, transform intersection patterns to EXISTS, and decorrelate subquery-like joins.
