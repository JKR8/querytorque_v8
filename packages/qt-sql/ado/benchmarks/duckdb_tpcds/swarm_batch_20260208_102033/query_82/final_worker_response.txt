**Changes**: Rewrote the 4-table join into a two-step semi-join strategy. First pre-filter items by price and manufacturer, then check existence in both inventory (pre-joined with date_dim and filtered) and store_sales independently using EXISTS clauses. This avoids the multiplicative explosion of the Cartesian join between inventory and store_sales.

**Expected speedup**: 2-4x. The rewrite eliminates the need to process all combinations between inventory and store_sales rows, instead performing two efficient semi-joins from a small filtered item set. The DISTINCT in the inventory CTE keeps the intermediate result minimal while preserving correct semantics.
