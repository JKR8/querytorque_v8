**Changes**: Transformed the complex OR conditions into 9 UNION ALL branches, each representing a specific combination of household/demographic and address conditions. This allows DuckDB to apply precise filtering in each branch and potentially use different access paths. Pre-filtered dates and consolidated store joins into a base CTE to avoid repetition.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.5x due to elimination of complex OR evaluation and enabling branch-specific optimization.
