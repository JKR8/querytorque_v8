**Changes**: Isolated dimension table filters (item and date_dim) and fact table filter (inventory) into separate CTEs before joining with the main fact table (catalog_sales). This allows DuckDB to build small hash tables from the filtered dimension tables and apply efficient join ordering.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5-2x by reducing the volume of data scanned from the large fact tables early and enabling better join optimization.
