WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs and materialize reusable aggregates to reduce intermediate data volume before joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter date_dim and store dimension into separate CTEs before the main aggregation to enable better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables early, then compute both base aggregates and store-level averages in a single pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_correlation_elimination
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Eliminate the correlated subquery by precomputing store averages, and explore alternative joins using UNION branches for state filtering.
