**Changes**: Implemented two-phase aggregation with date dimension pre-filtering. Created materialized CTE for date keys, pre-filtered store_returns, computed store-level thresholds separately, and used EXISTS instead of correlated scalar subquery while preserving the state filter at the final join.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x from bloom filter pre-filtering, reduced join volume, and elimination of correlated subquery execution overhead.
