```

**Changes**: Isolated date_dim (d_year=2000) and store (s_state='SD') into separate CTEs before the main aggregation, enabling predicate pushdown into the store_returns join. This reduces the fact table scan early.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5-2.0x from reduced join cardinality and early filtering.
