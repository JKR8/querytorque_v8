You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_reduction
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "d_date_sk" (use: "date_dim.d_date_sk" or "may_date.d_date_sk")
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into CTEs early to reduce fact table joins, materialize repeated subquery patterns, and apply predicate pushdown to minimize intermediate data.

  SELECT i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category = 'Women'

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling reuse across multiple sales channels and reducing redundant scans.

WITH may_1998_dates AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT d_date_sk, d_month_seq
  FROM date_dim

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "d_month_seq" (use: "date_dim.d_month_seq" or "base_month_seq.d_month_seq")
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, union_cte_split
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure the UNION into specialized branches for better join optimization and partition pruning.

filtered_item AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category = 'Women'

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, intersect_to_exists, or_to_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform correlated subqueries into join-efficient CTEs, convert hypothetical INTERSECT patterns to EXISTS, and explore splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL for index-friendly access.

```sql
WITH month_range AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        d_month_seq + 1 AS start_seq,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
