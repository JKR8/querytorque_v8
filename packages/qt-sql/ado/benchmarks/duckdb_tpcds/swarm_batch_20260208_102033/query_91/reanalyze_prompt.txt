You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filtering
- **Status**: pass (0.83x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply dimension table filtering first to reduce rows early, push predicates down, and materialize filtered subsets to avoid repeated computation during joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
      AND d_moy = 11
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.82x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate all filtered dimension tables (including date_dim) into separate CTEs before joining, enabling parallel filtering and reuse of dimension subsets.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
      AND d_moy = 11
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimension CTEs with the fact table in stages, and consolidate operations to minimize passes over large tables while maintaining filter pushdown.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
      AND d_moy = 11

    SELECT cd_demo_sk, hd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics
    JOIN household_demographics
      ON hd_demo_sk IS NOT NULL
    WHERE (
        (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')
        OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
    )
      AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
),

        fcd.cd_education_status
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 4: novel_structure_transformation
- **Status**: fail (0.70x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches, apply decorrelation techniques, and experiment with EXISTS transformations for better join planning.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
