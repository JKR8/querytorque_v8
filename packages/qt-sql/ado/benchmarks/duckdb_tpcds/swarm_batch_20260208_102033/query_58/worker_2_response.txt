Changes: Extracted shared date-week logic into reusable CTEs (target_week, target_dates) and pre-filtered all fact tables before joining with item dimension. This isolates date filtering to enable predicate pushdown and eliminates redundant date dimension scans across channel CTEs.

Expected speedup: 1.4-1.8x
