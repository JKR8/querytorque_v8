You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_61
## Target: 2.0x speedup

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filtering
- **Status**: pass (0.54x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on basic filter pushdown into subqueries, early dimension table filtering, and simple CTE materialization to reduce intermediate data volumes safely.

```sql
WITH filtered_dimensions AS (
  -- Pre-filter all dimension tables that are used in both subqueries
  -- This reduces the data volume early
  SELECT 
    s_store_sk,
    s_gmt_offset
  FROM store
  WHERE s_gmt_offset = -7
),
date_filter AS (
  SELECT 
    d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1999
    AND d_moy = 11
),
customer_address_filter AS (
  SELECT 
    ca_address_sk,
    c_customer_sk
  FROM customer_address
  JOIN customer ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -7
),
item_filter AS (
  SELECT 
    i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, isolating date filtering and sharing dimension filters between the two subqueries.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 11
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_gmt_offset = -7
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, c_customer_sk
    FROM customer_address
    JOIN customer ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
    WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -7
),
filtered_promotion AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_dmail = 'Y' 
       OR p_channel_email = 'Y' 
       OR p_channel_tv = 'Y'
),
promotional_sales AS (
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
- **Status**: pass (1.34x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with facts in CTEs, then consolidate both promotional and total calculations into a single CTE with conditional aggregation to eliminate duplicate scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 11
),
filtered_stores AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_gmt_offset = -7

    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -7
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
filtered_promotions AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_dmail = 'Y'
       OR p_channel_email = 'Y'
       OR p_channel_tv = 'Y'
),
joined_sales AS (
    SELECT
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.59x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions on promotion channels into UNION ALL branches, restructure subqueries as EXISTS patterns, and decorrelate any implicit dependencies between promotional and total logic.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 11
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_gmt_offset = -7
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -7
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
store_sales_base AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ext_sales_price,
        ss_promo_sk,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ss_item_sk
    FROM store_sales
    INNER JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced column "c_customer_sk" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "s_store_sk", "ss_customer_sk", "ss_cdemo_sk", "ss_store_sk", "ss_item_sk"

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
