The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering."

The original correlated LEFT JOIN was efficiently executed as a semi-join during the store_sales scan. Materializing both CTEs forces independent scans and loses the semi-join optimization."
