You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

      ,ss_item_sk item_sk

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push date filters early into CTEs, ensure predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate rows, and consider materializing CTEs for stability.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214 + 11
),
ssci AS (
    SELECT
        ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk,
        ss_item_sk AS item_sk
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
    GROUP BY
        ss_customer_sk,
        ss_item_sk
),
csci AS (
    SELECT
        cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk,
        cs_item_sk AS item_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
    GROUP BY
        cs_bill_customer_sk,
        cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN NOT ssci.customer_sk IS NULL AND csci.customer_sk IS NULL
            THEN 1
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate shared date filtering into a reusable CTE to eliminate duplicate scans and enable better dimension pushdown across both sales channels.

```sql
-- start query 97 in stream 0 using template query97.tpl
with ssci as (
select ss_customer_sk customer_sk
      ,ss_item_sk item_sk
from store_sales,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214 + 11
group by ss_customer_sk
        ,ss_item_sk),
csci as(
 select cs_bill_customer_sk customer_sk
      ,cs_item_sk item_sk
from catalog_sales,date_dim
where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214 + 11
group by cs_bill_customer_sk
        ,cs_item_sk)
 select sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) store_only
      ,sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) catalog_only
      ,sum(case when ssci.customer_sk is not null and csci.customer_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) store_and_catalog
from ssci full outer join csci on (ssci.customer_sk=csci.customer_sk
                               and ssci.item_sk = csci.item_sk)
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 97 in stream 0 using template query97.tpl
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: deferred_window_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure the multi-CTE pattern by prefetching dimension-filtered fact data, then attempt to consolidate the two channel aggregations into a single pass where possible.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214 + 11
),
store_agg AS (
  SELECT
    ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk,
    ss_item_sk AS item_sk
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  GROUP BY ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk
),
catalog_agg AS (
  SELECT
    cs_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk,
    cs_item_sk AS item_sk
  FROM catalog_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  GROUP BY cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN s.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND c.customer_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_only,
  SUM(CASE WHEN s.customer_sk IS NULL AND c.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS catalog_only,
  SUM(CASE WHEN s.customer_sk IS NOT NULL AND c.customer_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS store_and_catalog
FROM store_agg s
FULL OUTER JOIN catalog_agg c
  ON s.customer_sk = c.customer_sk AND s.item_sk = c.item_sk
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.57x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore radical transforms: convert the FULL OUTER JOIN logic to UNION/EXISTS patterns, or decompose the correlation between channels using decorrelation techniques.

```sql
WITH ssci AS (
  SELECT
    ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk,
    ss_item_sk AS item_sk
  FROM store_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214 + 11

  GROUP BY
    cs_bill_customer_sk,
    cs_item_sk
), all_pairs AS (
  SELECT customer_sk, item_sk, 1 AS store_flag, 0 AS catalog_flag FROM ssci
  UNION ALL
  SELECT customer_sk, item_sk, 0 AS store_flag, 1 AS catalog_flag FROM csci
), aggregated AS (
  SELECT
    customer_sk,
    item_sk,
    BOOL_OR(store_flag = 1) AS in_store,
    BOOL_OR(catalog_flag = 1) AS in_catalog
-- ... (truncated)
```

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
