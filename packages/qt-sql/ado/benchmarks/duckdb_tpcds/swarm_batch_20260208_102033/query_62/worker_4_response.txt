**Changes**: Extracted date filtering into a separate CTE to reduce the web_sales scan before joining with large dimension tables. This follows the "early_filter" and "dimension_cte_isolate" principles from the examples.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5-2x by reducing the web_sales table scan to only relevant date ranges before expensive joins.
