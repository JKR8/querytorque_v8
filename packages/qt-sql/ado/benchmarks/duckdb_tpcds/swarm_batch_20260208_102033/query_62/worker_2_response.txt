Changes: Isolated date filtering and dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table. This enables predicate pushdown on date_dim and creates small hash tables for dimension joins.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x by reducing intermediate result sizes and enabling better join order optimization.
