**Changes**: Created CTEs for each dimension table with filters pushed down early, then joined them with the fact table. This allows early reduction of dimension tables before the fact table join, reducing the join workload.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x by reducing the fact table join to only matching dimension keys and avoiding full dimension table scans.
