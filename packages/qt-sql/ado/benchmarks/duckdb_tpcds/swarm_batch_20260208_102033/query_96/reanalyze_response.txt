FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All workers fell short because they implemented essentially the same optimization: early filtering of dimension tables via CTEs followed by fact table joins. This approach fails because:
1. DuckDB's optimizer already performs predicate pushdown automatically in the original star-join pattern.
2. CTEs may force materialization or disrupt join reordering optimization, preventing DuckDB from selecting optimal join orders.
3. The critical bottleneck is scanning the massive store_sales table—all attempts still require full or partial scans despite filters on small dimension tables.
4. Worker 3's IN-subquery approach (0.95x) actually regresses performance due to repeated semi-join evaluations.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Composite key pre-join**: Create a single CTE with all dimension keys combined before joining with fact table, enabling a single multi-key join.
2. **Aggressive fact table pruning**: Use WHERE EXISTS or multi-column IN with pre-aggregated dimension keys to reduce fact table scans.
3. **Columnar scan optimization**: Leverage DuckDB's columnar execution by projecting only necessary columns early.
4. **Statistical filtering**: Use knowledge of data distribution (e.g., time hour = 8 occurs in 1/24 of rows) to guide join order.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a consolidated dimension key set via CROSS JOIN of filtered dimensions (guaranteed small), then perform a single efficient hash join against store_sales using all three foreign keys simultaneously. This reduces the fact table probe to a single pass with composite key lookups, minimizing I/O and leveraging DuckDB's vectorized join execution.

EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation, early_filter
HINT: Pre-compute all valid dimension key combinations into a minimal composite lookup table, then join once with store_sales using all foreign keys at once to eliminate multiple join iterations.

```sql
WITH filtered_dims AS (
    SELECT 
        t_time_sk,
        hd_demo_sk, 
        s_store_sk
    FROM 
        (SELECT t_time_sk FROM time_dim WHERE t_hour = 8 AND t_minute >= 30) AS time,
        (SELECT hd_demo_sk FROM household_demographics WHERE hd_dep_count = 3) AS hh,
        (SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_store_name = 'ese') AS store
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_dims 
    ON store_sales.ss_sold_time_sk = filtered_dims.t_time_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = filtered_dims.hd_demo_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_store_sk = filtered_dims.s_store_sk
-- ORDER BY COUNT(*) LIMIT 100  -- Removed: single-row result makes this redundant
