**Changes**: Isolated date filtering into a CTE, computed date differences early, aggregated by surrogate keys before joining dimension tables, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This reduces data movement by performing aggregation on a minimal set of integer columns before expensive string operations and dimension lookups.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x due to reduced join cardinality and deferred string processing.
