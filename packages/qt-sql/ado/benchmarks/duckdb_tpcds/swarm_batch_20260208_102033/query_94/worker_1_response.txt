**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOINs and created filtered CTEs for dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) to apply their selective predicates early before joining with the large web_sales fact table. Preserved EXISTS/NOT EXISTS semantics as-is.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x due to early reduction of the web_sales join via filtered dimension CTEs, while maintaining safe, conservative optimization boundaries.
