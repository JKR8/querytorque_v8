Changes: Isolated three dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) into separate CTEs with their respective filters before joining with the main web_sales table. This enables early predicate pushdown and creates small hash tables for efficient probing. Preserved original EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is to maintain short-circuit evaluation semantics.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x from reduced dimension table scans and better join performance.
