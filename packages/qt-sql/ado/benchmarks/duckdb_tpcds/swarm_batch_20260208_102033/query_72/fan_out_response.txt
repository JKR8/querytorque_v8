WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown to dimension tables before joining, use CTEs to materialize filtered dimensions, and leverage DuckDB's ability to push filters through joins for minimal intermediate data.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Isolate each date_dim alias (d1,d2,d3) into separate filtered CTEs, pre-filter all dimension tables, then join with fact tables to reduce join cardinality early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create layered CTEs—first filter dimensions, then pre-join them with catalog_sales before other joins, and share filtered dimensions across date aliases to avoid repeated filtering.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore converting implicit OR conditions in CASE statements to UNION ALL branches, transform join patterns to EXISTS subqueries, and decorrelate complex join logic for alternative execution plans.
