**Changes**: Isolated store and household_demographics filters into separate CTEs, combined all time windows into a single scan, and performed conditional aggregation in one pass instead of eight separate subqueries. This enables predicate pushdown and eliminates repeated joins.

**Expected speedup**: 3-5x (single fact table scan instead of eight, small dimension hash tables, reduced join overhead)
