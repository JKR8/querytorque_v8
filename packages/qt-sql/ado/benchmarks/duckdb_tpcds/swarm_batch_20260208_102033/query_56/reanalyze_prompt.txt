## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.19x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs, filtering dimensions before joins, and materializing the repeated item subquery to avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
  SELECT i_item_id, i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'green', 'cyan')
),
filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 2
),
filtered_addr AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -6
),
ss AS (
  SELECT
    fi.i_item_id,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_item fi ON ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
  JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_addr fa ON ss_addr_sk = fa.ca_address_sk
  GROUP BY fi.i_item_id
),
cs AS (
  SELECT
    fi.i_item_id,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales
  FROM catalog_sales
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, address, item) into reusable CTEs before joining with each fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2000
    AND d_moy = 2
),
filtered_addresses AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -6

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.18x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure by pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts in dedicated CTEs, then attempt to consolidate the three channel aggregations into a single pass where possible.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
  SELECT
    i_item_id,
    i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE
    i_color IN ('powder', 'green', 'cyan')
),

    ca_address_sk
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE
    ca_gmt_offset = -6
),

  SELECT
    fi.i_item_id,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales

  JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
  JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure by splitting OR conditions (color filter) into UNION branches, converting subquery patterns, and decorrelating where applicable for alternative execution paths.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_id, i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_color IN ('powder', 'green', 'cyan')
),
filtered_dates AS (

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
