**Changes**: Created CTEs to filter small dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, call_center) first, then joined them with catalog_sales. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filtered dimensions early, while preserving the original EXISTS/NOT EXISTS semi-joins unchanged.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-4x from reducing the catalog_sales scan and early filtering.
