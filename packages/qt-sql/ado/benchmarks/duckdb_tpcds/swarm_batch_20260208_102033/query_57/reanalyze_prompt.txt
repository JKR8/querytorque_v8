You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.16x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering to dimension tables and push predicates into CTEs to reduce intermediate data volume before expensive joins and window functions.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE (d_year = 1999)
     OR (d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 12)
     OR (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
),

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter each dimension table (date_dim, item, call_center) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join optimization.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE (d_year = 1999)
     OR (d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 12)
     OR (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
),

    ) AS avg_monthly_sales,
    RANK() OVER (

    ) AS rn

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure the query to pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in a single pass, then compute window functions on the reduced dataset, avoiding repeated self-joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE 
    d_year = 1999
    OR (d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 12)

```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.72x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the OR date filter into UNION ALL branches for better partition pruning, and explore consolidating the self-join logic into a single-pass LAG/LEAD window function.

    -- Branch 1: d_year = 1999

        i_category,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
