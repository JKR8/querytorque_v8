```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_join_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations like pushing filters into subqueries, filtering dimensions before joins, and materializing repetitive patterns with CTEs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension filtering (date, item) into reusable CTEs before joining with fact tables to reduce redundant computation across all three sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables into separate CTEs, then restructure the UNION branches to scan pre-joined intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural changes like converting the UNION pattern to use EXISTS decorrelation or transforming the query to use OR conditions with subsequent split.
