**Changes**: Restructured the query using aggressive prefetch strategy: created filtered CTEs for all dimension tables (customer_demographics, date_dim, promotion), then pre-joined them with the fact table in a staged CTE before final aggregation with item. This reduces intermediate data movement by filtering dimensions early and performing a single-pass aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x due to reduced fact table scanning through early dimension filtering and staged join pipeline.
