WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply basic filtering optimization by pushing conditions into CTEs and materializing reusable subqueries to reduce row processing early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate and pre-filter the dimension table (item) into CTEs before the main correlation, enabling better predicate pushdown and reducing correlated subquery complexity.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_correlation_elimination
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, single_pass_aggregation, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Eliminate the correlated subquery entirely by converting it to joins with pre-aggregated CTEs, enabling single-pass processing of the item table.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform the complex OR conditions into UNION ALL branches for better index usage and restructure the existence check using alternative patterns.
