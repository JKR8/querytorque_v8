You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (date_dim, item, store) before joining, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize repeated expressions.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_brand,
    i_product_name,
    d_year,
    d_qoy,
    d_moy,

      FROM date_dim

-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimensions into separate CTEs (date range, item categories) before joining with fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join planning.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206 + 11

### Worker 3: aggressive_cte_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure with multiple CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions, defer window function computation until after aggregation to reduce data volume.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk,
        d_year,
        d_qoy,

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
