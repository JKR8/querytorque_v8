You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_12

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering on dimension tables (item, date_dim) to reduce fact table joins, push down all predicates before aggregation, and materialize filtered dimensions as CTEs.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) 
                     AND (CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)
), filtered_item AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_item_id,
        i_item_desc,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Books', 'Sports', 'Men')
)
SELECT
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (
        PARTITION BY i_class
    ) AS revenueratio
FROM web_sales
JOIN filtered_item ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_date ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
GROUP BY

```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with web_sales, enabling independent optimization and predicate pushdown on each dimension.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_item_id,
        i_item_desc,
        i_category,
        i_class,
        i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Books', 'Sports', 'Men')
),

    SELECT 
        d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) 
        AND (CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)

    i.i_item_id,
    i.i_item_desc,

    SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
    SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ws.ws_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM web_sales ws
JOIN filtered_items i ON ws.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates d ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
GROUP BY

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in a staged CTE, then compute window aggregation separately to reduce intermediate data volume.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
  SELECT 
    i_item_sk,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (0.37x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the IN clause on i_category into UNION ALL branches, restructure subqueries using EXISTS patterns, and decorrelate hypothetical complex filters.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
