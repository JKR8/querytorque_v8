WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filters
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering and predicate pushdown to reduce data volume before joins; materialize repeated patterns to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_restructure
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown; defer window calculations to reduce intermediate data.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_channel_prefetch
EXAMPLES: shared_dimension_multi_channel, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join shared dimensions across channels in dedicated CTEs; consolidate fact-table scans to minimize redundant processing.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform full outer joins and complex conditions into UNION/EXISTS patterns; decorrelate and flatten query structure for better join planning.
