FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
The attempts fell short due to superficial application of optimization patterns without addressing the core computational bottlenecks. Worker 1's conservative pushdown missed crucial early filtering of large fact tables. Worker 2 incorrectly filtered date dimensions for d2/d3 when they shouldn't be restricted to 2001-2002. Worker 3 achieved moderate success (1.24x) by prefetching filters but failed to push item filtering into the expensive cs_ui CTE. Worker 4's structural transforms were inappropriate for this query pattern and caused regression. Worker 5 recycled partial optimizations without addressing the main cost driver: the cs_ui CTE performs a massive aggregation on catalog_sales/returns without any filtering, while the main query only needs items satisfying color/price conditions.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Push item filtering into cs_ui**: The cs_ui CTE aggregates ALL catalog items, but cross_sales only needs items meeting color/price conditions. Pre-filtering catalog tables by item attributes could reduce cs_ui by 95%+.
2. **Consolidate fact table scans**: Instead of separate filtered CTEs, create a single filtered item set and use it to filter both catalog and store fact tables early.
3. **Selective date filtering**: Only d1 (ss_sold_date_sk) needs year filtering; d2/d3 should remain unfiltered to avoid incorrect restrictions.
4. **Aggressive fact reduction**: Pre-join store_sales with filtered items and dates before the 17-way join, dramatically reducing the largest fact table early.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a unified filtered item CTE with color/price conditions. Use it to filter BOTH catalog tables in cs_ui AND store_sales early. Pre-join store_sales with filtered items and date_dim d1 (2001-2002) before joining with other dimensions. Maintain separate unfiltered date CTEs for d2/d3. Restructure cs_ui to join catalog tables with filtered items first, then aggregate only eligible items.

EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, shared_dimension_multi_channel, early_filter
HINT: Create filtered_item CTE → use it to filter catalog_sales/returns in cs_ui → pre-join store_sales with filtered_item and filtered_d1 → then join with other dimensions in single pass with consolidated WHERE conditions.
