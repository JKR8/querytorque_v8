  "what_worked": "Applied prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation: Applied aggressive multi-CTE prefetch by creating staged CTEs for filtered dimensions (item and date_dim) before joining with the fact table. This reduces the catalog_sales scan early by pushing down selective filters. The conditional aggregations remain consolidated in a single scan.",
