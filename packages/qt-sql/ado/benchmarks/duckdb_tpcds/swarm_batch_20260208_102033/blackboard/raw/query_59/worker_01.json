  "what_worked": "Applied pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte: ** \n1. Extracted two CTEs (`filtered_dates1` and `filtered_dates2`) to pre-filter date_dim by the respective month ranges before joining with the main aggregated CTE.\n2. Converted all implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.\n3. Separated the two year-specific subqueries into independent CTEs (`year1` and `year2`) that join the pre-filtered dates with the aggregated sales data.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~1.5-2x due to reduced join sizes from early dimension filtering and ",
