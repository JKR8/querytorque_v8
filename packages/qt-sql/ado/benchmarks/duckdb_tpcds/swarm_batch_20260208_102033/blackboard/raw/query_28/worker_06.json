  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short because they failed to address the fundamental performance bottleneck: repeated full-table scans and inefficient OR predicate evaluation.

Worker 4's OR-to-UNION (0.78x) multiplied scan count from 6 to 18 subqueries. Worker 5's refined single-pass (0.66x) still suffered from expensive DISTINCT ca",
