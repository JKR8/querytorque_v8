  "what_worked": "Applied prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_dimension_prefetch: Pre-filtered all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with store_sales, then used conditional aggregation to compute both promotional and total sales in a single pass through the fact table. This eliminates duplicate scans of store_sales and early reduces data volume.",
