  "why_it_worked": "Consolidating repeated scans into CASE aggregates reduces I/O from N scans to 1; Separate CTEs for each date alias avoids ambiguous multi-way date joins; Replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS avoids materializing full intermediate sets; Applying selective filters early reduces intermediate row counts before expensive operations",
