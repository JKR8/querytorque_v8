Then used EXISTS subqueries to prune catalog_sales rows early while preserving semi-join short-circuiting. Aggregated at the item level before the final join with item dimension, reducing the data volume for the final join. This transforms the 5-way join into a progressive filtering and aggregation pipeline.",
