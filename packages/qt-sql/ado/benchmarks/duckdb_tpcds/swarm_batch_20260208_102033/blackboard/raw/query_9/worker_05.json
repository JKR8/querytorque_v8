  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short because they failed to address the fundamental bottleneck: DuckDB's columnar execution engine struggles with computing 15 different conditional aggregates (5 counts + 10 averages) in a single scan when they involve overlapping CASE conditions. The original query's independent subqueries allow DuckDB to apply specialized optimizations for each quantity range (potentially using zonemaps/min-max filtering), while the consolidated approaches force evaluation of all conditions",
