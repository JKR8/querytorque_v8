  "what_worked": "Applied early_filter, pushdown, dimension_cte_isolate: Pre-filtered all dimension tables (customer_demographics, date_dim, store) into CTEs before joining to the large fact table store_sales. This reduces the fact table join to only rows matching the filtered surrogate keys. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and optimizer freedom.",
