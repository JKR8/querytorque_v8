The main aggregation now operates on pre-filtered dimension keys.",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering multiple dimension tables in parallel reduces join fan-out; Pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation reduces join input",
