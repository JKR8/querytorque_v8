DuckDB's optimizer already pushes down these simple filters, making CTE materialization redundant overhead. The attempts overlooked: 1) The core bottleneck is scanning store_sales (massive fact table) with 3 dimension joins and complex OR filters; 2) The ratio filter `hd_dep_count/hd_vehicle_count > 1.2` prevents efficient predicate pushdown; 3)",
