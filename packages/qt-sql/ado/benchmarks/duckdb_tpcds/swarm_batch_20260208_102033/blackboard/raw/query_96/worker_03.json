This approach fails because:\n1. DuckDB's optimizer already performs predicate pushdown automatically in the original star-join pattern.\n2. CTEs may force materialization or disrupt join reordering optimization, preventing DuckDB from selecting optimal join orders.\n3. The critical bottleneck is scanning the massive store_sales table\u2014all atte",
