This reduces the fact table scan by applying all selective filters early via dimension pre-joins.",
  "why_it_failed": "All workers fell short due to improper join ordering and missed opportunities to reduce the largest fact table early. Worker 1-2 isolated dimension filtering but still joined all filtered dimensions to customer before joining to catalog_returns, forcing unnecessary work on the customer table. Worker 3's cross join between customer_demographics and household_demographics was catastrophic. Worker 4's UNION ALL approach fragmented the query but still processed the large fact table through multiple ",
