Pre-joined store sales with filtered items and date dimension d1 (for years 2001-2002) before joining with other dimensions. Restructured `cs_ui` to join catalog tables with filtered items first. This reduces the fact table joins by applying filters at the earliest possible stage.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2-3x by reducing the volume of catalog ",
