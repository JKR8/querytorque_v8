  "what_worked": "Applied intersect_to_exists, decorrelate, or_to_union: Transformed the self-join on `all_sales` into a single-pass aggregation that computes both 1998 and 1999 metrics in conditional sums. This eliminates the expensive self-join and pushes year filters down into the UNION branches. Also changed UNION to UNION ALL for efficiency since duplicates are eliminated by later aggregation.",
  "why_it_worked": "Replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS avoids materializing full intermediate sets; Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Converting OR to UNION ALL lets optimizer choose independent index paths per branch",
