  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate: Created a shared `week_dates` CTE to compute the target week dates once instead of three separate correlated subqueries, and introduced a `filtered_items` CTE to separate join/filter logic from final calculation. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.",
