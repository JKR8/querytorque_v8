This creates massive intermediate cardinality (store_sales rows duplicated for each matching zip in the same state). Workers 1-5 focused on dimension pre-filtering and zip derivation optimization, but none addressed the core join explosion. Worker 3's aggressive restructuring actually made performance worse (0.80x",
