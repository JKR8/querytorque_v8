  "what_worked": "Applied or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate: Replaced the UNION ALL CTE with separate store and web CTEs, then joined them directly with explicit year filters instead of self-joining a single CTE four times. This eliminates the redundant sale_type filters and allows better join planning.",
  "why_it_worked": "Converting OR to UNION ALL lets optimizer choose independent index paths per branch; Replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS avoids materializing full intermediate sets; Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead",
