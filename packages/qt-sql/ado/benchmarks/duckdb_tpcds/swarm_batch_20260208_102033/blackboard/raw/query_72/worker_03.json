  "what_failed": "Regression (0.41x): Applied aggressive prefetch restructuring by creating layered CTEs: first filtered dimension tables (household_demographics, customer_demographics, date_dim d1), then pre-joined them with catalog_sales, item, and inventory in a core CTE, then sequentially joined remaining date dimensions (d2, d3) and warehouse, and finally performed the outer joins and aggregation in the main query. This reduces early data volume and avoids repeated filtering of the same dimension tables.",
  "why_it_failed": "Converted a correlated LEFT JOIN + filter into two materialized CTEs (sales_with_filtered_returns AND filtered_returns), both scanning store_returns. The original correlated LEFT JOIN was efficiently executed as a semi-join during the store_sales scan. Materializing both CTEs forces independent scans and loses the semi-join optimization.",
