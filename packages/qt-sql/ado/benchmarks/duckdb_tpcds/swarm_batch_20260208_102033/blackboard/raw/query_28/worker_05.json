Worker 1's CTE materialization (1.05x) added overhead without reducing scan count. Worker 3's single-pass aggregation (0.57x) overloaded CPU with complex CASE evaluations per row. Worker 4's OR-to-UNION (0.78x) multiplied scan count from 6 to 18 subqueries. Worker 5's refined single-pass (0.66x) still suffered from expensive DISTINCT ca",
