  "what_worked": "Applied prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation: Implemented aggressive prefetch by first filtering date_dim to the relevant 12-month range, then joining only those keys with catalog_sales to precompute the days difference. This reduces the fact table early and consolidates all CASE logic into a single pass using the precomputed difference.",
