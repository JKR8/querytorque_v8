  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, union_cte_split, date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join: Applied shared dimension extraction by pre-filtering item and date_dim tables into CTEs, then joined with each sales channel. Also split the aggregated all_sales into year-specific CTEs (curr_year_sales, prev_year_sales) to avoid scanning the full aggregated data twice.",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Splitting complex UNION into separate CTEs enables per-branch optimization; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering all dimension tables into CTEs avoids repeated full-table scans; Pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation reduces join input",
