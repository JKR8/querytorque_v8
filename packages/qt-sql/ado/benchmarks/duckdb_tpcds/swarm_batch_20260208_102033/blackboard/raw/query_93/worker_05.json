This reduces the store_returns scan to only relevant rows and avoids scanning all store_sales rows during the reason filter.",
  "why_it_failed": "Converted a correlated LEFT JOIN + filter into two materialized CTEs (sales_with_filtered_returns AND filtered_returns), both scanning store_returns. The original correlated LEFT JOIN was efficiently executed as a semi-join during the store_sales scan. Materializing both CTEs forces independent scans and loses the semi-join optimization.",
