  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch: ** Applied dimension isolation with progressive filtering: created separate CTEs for each filtered dimension (date_dim, store, household_demographics) before joining with the fact table. Pushed the `cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5` filter into the sales aggregation CTE as a HAVING clause to reduce rows before the final customer join.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.0\u20132.5x. Early filtering of dimension tables creates smaller hash tables for joins and reduces the fact table probe cost. Moving the cnt filter earlier ",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering multiple dimension tables in parallel reduces join fan-out",
