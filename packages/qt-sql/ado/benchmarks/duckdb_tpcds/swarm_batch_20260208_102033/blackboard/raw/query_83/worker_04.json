  "what_worked": "Applied or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split: ** \n1. Created a `date_filter` CTE to compute the qualifying date keys once instead of repeating the same subquery in three places.\n2. Converted implicit joins to explicit `JOIN` syntax for better optimizer handling.\n3. Replaced `IN` subqueries with scalar subqueries against the precomputed `date_filter` CTE.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~1.3-1.5x due to eliminating redundant date subquery computations and giving the optimizer better join planning.",
  "why_it_worked": "Converting OR to UNION ALL lets optimizer choose independent index paths per branch; Replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS avoids materializing full intermediate sets; Splitting complex UNION into separate CTEs enables per-branch optimization",
