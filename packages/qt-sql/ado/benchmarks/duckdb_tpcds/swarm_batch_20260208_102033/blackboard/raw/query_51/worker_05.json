  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate: ** Deferred window aggregation by computing daily sums first, moving cumulative calculations after the join. Added shared dimension CTE to filter dates once. Removed redundant MAX windows since cumulative sums are non-decreasing.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~2.2x (eliminates duplicate date_dim scans, reduces window function computations, and avoids materializing cumulative results before the join)",
