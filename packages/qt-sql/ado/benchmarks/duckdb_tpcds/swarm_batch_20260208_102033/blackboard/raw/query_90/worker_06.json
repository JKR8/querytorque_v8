Created filtered CTEs for dimension tables to push filters early and build small hash tables before joining with the large fact table. Used explicit INNER JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~2x from eliminating duplicate fact table scans and early dimension filtering.",
