WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: pre-filter all dimension tables into CTEs before joining to dramatically reduce fact table joins, and push all eligible predicates down into these CTEs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and other dimension filters into separate CTEs to maximize predicate pushdown, then strategically prefilter the fact table by joining with the most selective dimension CTEs first.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, materialize_cte
HINT: Restructure with aggressive CTE chaining: pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in stages, and consolidate operations to minimize full table scans while materializing intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Apply advanced structural transformations: convert the IN-list filter to UNION ALL branches for potential index benefits, and explore EXISTS transformations even if not present, using these patterns as inspiration for radical rewrites.
