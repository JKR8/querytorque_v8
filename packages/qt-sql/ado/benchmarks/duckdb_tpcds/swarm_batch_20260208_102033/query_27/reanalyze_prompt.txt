You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_27
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 27 in stream 0 using template query27.tpl
select i_item_id,
        s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state,
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.51x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, dimension_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations: pre-filter all dimension tables into CTEs before joining to dramatically reduce fact table joins, and push all eligible predicates down into these CTEs.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
  SELECT cd_demo_sk
  FROM customer_demographics
  WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
    AND cd_marital_status = 'D'
    AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
),
filtered_date_dim AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1999
),
filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
  FROM store
  WHERE s_state IN ('MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'TN', 'LA', 'SC')
)
SELECT
  i.i_item_id,
  fs.s_state,
  GROUPING(fs.s_state) AS g_state,
  AVG(ss.ss_quantity) AS agg1,
  AVG(ss.ss_list_price) AS agg2,
  AVG(ss.ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3,
  AVG(ss.ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_customer_demographics fcd ON ss.ss_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk
JOIN filtered_date_dim fdd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fdd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_store fs ON ss.ss_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk
JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.58x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and other dimension filters into separate CTEs to maximize predicate pushdown, then strategically prefilter the fact table by joining with the most selective dimension CTEs first.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state IN ('MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'TN', 'LA', 'SC')
),
filtered_cdemo AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'D'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
)
SELECT
    i.i_item_id,
    fs.s_state,
    GROUPING(fs.s_state) AS g_state,
    AVG(ss.ss_quantity) AS agg1,
    AVG(ss.ss_list_price) AS agg2,
    AVG(ss.ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3,
    AVG(ss.ss_sales_price) AS agg4

JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_store fs ON ss.ss_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk
JOIN filtered_cdemo fcd ON ss.ss_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk
JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.56x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure with aggressive CTE chaining: pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in stages, and consolidate operations to minimize full table scans while materializing intermediate results.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'D'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
),
filtered_date_dim AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state IN ('MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'TN', 'LA', 'SC')
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
),
joined_fact AS (
    SELECT
        i.i_item_id,
        s.s_state,
        ss.ss_quantity,
        ss.ss_list_price,
        ss.ss_coupon_amt,
        ss.ss_sales_price
    FROM store_sales ss
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Values list "sb" does not have a column named "ss_sold_date_sk"

LINE 111: JOIN filtered_date_dim fd ON sb.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
                                       ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Apply advanced structural transformations: convert the IN-list filter to UNION ALL branches for potential index benefits, and explore EXISTS transformations even if not present, using these patterns as inspiration for radical rewrites.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
