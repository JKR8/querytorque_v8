  "failure_analysis": "All attempts fell short of 2.0x because they focused on dimension table optimizations without addressing the fundamental bottleneck: the massive store_sales table. Worker 1's CTE approach actually added overhead (0.84x). Worker 2's dimension isolation helped but still processed the full fact table join. Worker 3 failed due to ambiguous column reference in CTE joins. Workers 4-5 achieved modest gains (1.22-1.23x) by decorrelating subqueries but still used the same join order and processed all store_sales rows before filtering by item price conditions. The root cause is that all approaches perform expensive joins BEFORE applying the selective item price filter (i_current_price > 1.2 * category avg), causing unnecessary processing of non-qualifying sales records.",
  "unexplored": "1. **Fact-first filtering**: Process store_sales first with item and date filters before joining to customer dimensions\n2. **Early aggregation at fact level**: Aggregate at store_sales level before joining to customer_address to reduce data volume\n3. **Multi-level filtering**: Filter store_sales by date, then join items for price check, THEN join customer dimensions\n4. **Alternative join order**: Start with store_sales \u2192 date_dim \u2192 item \u2192 customer \u2192 customer_address (current attempts all start from dimension tables)\n5. **Materialized subquery for store_sales**: Create a CTE that filters store_sales by date and item price in one pass",
  "refined_strategy": "Adopt a fact-first approach that filters store_sales aggressively before dimension joins. Start with date_dim to get target month's date keys, join to store_sales, then join to items with pre-computed category price thresholds, creating a filtered fact set. Only then join to customer and customer_address for final aggregation. This minimizes the expensive fact table processing by applying the most selective filters earliest in the pipeline.",

  "hint": "Start with store_sales filtered by date, then filter by item price using pre-computed category averages BEFORE joining to customer dimensions. Structure CTEs to process: 1) target dates, 2) category price thresholds, 3) filtered store_sales with both conditions, 4) then join to customer and address for final aggregation."
