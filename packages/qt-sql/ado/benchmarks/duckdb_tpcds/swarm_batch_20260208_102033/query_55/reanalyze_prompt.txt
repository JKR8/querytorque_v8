You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_55
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 55 in stream 0 using template query55.tpl
select i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
 from date_dim, store_sales, item
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 	and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
 	and i_manager_id=100
 	and d_moy=12
 	and d_year=2000
 group by i_brand, i_brand_id
 order by ext_price desc, i_brand_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 55 in stream 0 using template query55.tpl
```

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering on dimension tables and push predicates down to reduce the size of intermediate results before joining.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2000
), filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
    filtered_item.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    filtered_item.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(store_sales.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = filtered_item.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    filtered_item.i_brand_id,
    filtered_item.i_brand
ORDER BY
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 2: dimension_isolation_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs and then join with the fact table to minimize the fact table scan cost.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fi.i_brand_id,
    fi.i_brand
ORDER BY
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure using multiple CTEs to isolate date ranges and consolidate operations into single-pass aggregations for complex scenarios.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_moy = 12
    AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
  FROM item
  WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
  i_brand_id AS brand_id,
  i_brand AS brand,
  SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_dates ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = filtered_items.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
  i_brand,
  i_brand_id
ORDER BY
  ext_price DESC,
  i_brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transformation
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure by splitting OR conditions, converting INTERSECT to EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2000
), filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    i.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_dates d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
GROUP BY i.i_brand, i.i_brand_id
ORDER BY ext_price DESC, i.i_brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
    fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    fi.i_brand AS brand,
    SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price

GROUP BY
    fi.i_brand_id,
    fi.i_brand
ORDER BY
    ext_price DESC,
    brand_id

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
