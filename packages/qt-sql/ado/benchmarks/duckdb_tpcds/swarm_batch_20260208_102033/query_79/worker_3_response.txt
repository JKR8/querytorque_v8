**Changes**: Pre-filtered all three dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, then performed aggregation in a single pass. This reduces the fact table join to only relevant dimension keys early.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3× from eliminating unnecessary fact-dimension joins and reducing intermediate data movement.
