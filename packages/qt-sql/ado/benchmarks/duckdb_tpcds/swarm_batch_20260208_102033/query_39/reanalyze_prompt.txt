## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: fail (11.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters early into CTEs, isolate dimension table filtering, and materialize the repeated inv CTE to avoid redundant computation across both query blocks.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1998
    AND d_moy IN (1, 2)
),
inv_raw AS (
  SELECT
    w.w_warehouse_sk,
    i.i_item_sk,
    fd.d_moy,

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: fail (8.72x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter date_dim and other dimension tables into dedicated CTEs before joining with the large fact table, reducing join cardinality early.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
      AND d_moy IN (1, 2)

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: fail (8.79x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure the query to prefetch filtered dimension-fact joins, then compute both month aggregates in a single pass, potentially pivoting d_moy values.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1998
    AND d_moy IN (1, 2)

-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: fail (12.85x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore transforming the self-join into UNION/EXISTS patterns or decorrelating subquery structures, even if not directly present, to unlock alternative join plans.

```sql
WITH inv_month1 AS (
  SELECT
    w_warehouse_sk,
    i_item_sk,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
