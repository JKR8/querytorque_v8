**Changes**: Isolated date_dim and customer_address into filtered CTEs before the main aggregation, then created a separate CTE for Indiana customers to reduce join cardinality in the main query.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2.0x due to smaller hash tables for dimension joins and reduced row propagation through the aggregation.
