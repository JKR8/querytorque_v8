**Changes**: 
1. Created filtered dimension CTEs for date_dim (year=2002) and customer_address (state='IN')
2. Pre-filtered web_returns using IN clauses with these CTEs before aggregation
3. Computed state averages in the same pass using a window function instead of a correlated subquery
4. Created a filtered customer CTE for Indiana customers before joining with aggregated results
5. Converted implicit joins to explicit IN clauses and removed redundant joins

**Expected speedup**: 3-5x by drastically reducing fact table scans and eliminating the correlated subquery overhead through single-pass aggregation with window functions.
