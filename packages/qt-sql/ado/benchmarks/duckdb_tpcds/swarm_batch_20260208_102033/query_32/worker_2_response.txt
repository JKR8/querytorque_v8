Changes: Isolated filtered dimension tables (`date_dim` and `item`) into CTEs to reduce join cardinality early, precomputed the correlated subquery's average discount per item in the same date range as a separate CTE, and used explicit joins to replace the correlated subquery with a single-pass join.

Expected speedup: 2.0x–3.0x due to early dimension filtering, removal of correlated subquery overhead, and reduced join cardinality.
