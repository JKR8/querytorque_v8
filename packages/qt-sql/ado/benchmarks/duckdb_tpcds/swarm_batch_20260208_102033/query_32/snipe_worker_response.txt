```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY)
),
item_avg_discount AS (
  SELECT 
    cs_item_sk,
    1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
  FROM catalog_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  GROUP BY cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
  SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
JOIN item_avg_discount ON cs_item_sk = item_avg_discount.cs_item_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 29
  AND cs_ext_discount_amt > threshold
LIMIT 100
```

Changes: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing date-filtered dimension and item-specific average discounts in separate CTEs, then joining them in the main query. This eliminates per-row subquery execution while preserving exact semantics.

Expected speedup: 2.0-2.5x (removes correlated subquery overhead, enables better join optimization)
