```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY)
),
item_avg_discount AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_item_sk,
        1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    GROUP BY cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
    SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
JOIN item_avg_discount ON cs_item_sk = item_avg_discount.cs_item_sk
WHERE i_manufact_id = 29
    AND cs_ext_discount_amt > item_avg_discount.threshold
LIMIT 100
```

Changes: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing per-item average discount thresholds in a CTE, extracted the common date filter into a reusable CTE, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

Expected speedup: 2.0-3.0x by eliminating per-row correlated subquery execution and enabling better join optimization.
