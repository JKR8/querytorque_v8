WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables first, push date predicates into subqueries, and materialize the repeated correlated subquery logic into a CTE to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate
HINT: Create separate CTEs for pre-filtered date and item dimensions, then decorrelate the subquery by precomputing per-item averages for the date range before joining.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Precompute the date range as a CTE, prefetch filtered fact-dimension joins, and restructure using shared dimension CTEs to streamline the multi-step filtering and aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, composite_decorrelate_union, or_to_union
HINT: Consolidate the main query and subquery into a single-pass aggregation, transform correlation via union-based decorrelation, and explore splitting any implicit OR conditions for optimal indexing.
