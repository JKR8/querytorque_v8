Changes: Applied OR-to-UNION decomposition across both independent OR condition sets (3x3 combinations), pre-filtered date and reason dimensions, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: 3.0x+ due to elimination of complex OR evaluation, better predicate pushdown, and reduced intermediate result sizes.
