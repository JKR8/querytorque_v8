Changes: Applied aggressive fact prefetch restructuring by creating CTEs for filtered date_dim and item tables first, then joining them with store_sales in a single aggregation pass that computes both the sum and windowed average simultaneously.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by eliminating repeated full table scans and reducing join cardinality early in the pipeline.
