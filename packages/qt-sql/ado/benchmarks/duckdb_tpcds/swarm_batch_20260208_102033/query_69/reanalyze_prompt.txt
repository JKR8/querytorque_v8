You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte

- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, composite_decorrelate_union, prefetch_fact_join

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
