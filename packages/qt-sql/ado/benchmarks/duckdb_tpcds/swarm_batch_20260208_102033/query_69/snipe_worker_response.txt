Changes: Decorrelated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS conditions by pre-materializing distinct customer sets for each sales channel within the date range, then filtering customers in a single pass. Applied explicit joins and created targeted CTEs with early filtering.

Expected speedup: 2.0x-2.5x by eliminating repeated correlated subquery evaluation and reducing join cardinality early.
