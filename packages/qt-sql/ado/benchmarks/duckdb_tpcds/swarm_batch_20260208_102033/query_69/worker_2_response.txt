Changes: Created a filtered_dates CTE to isolate the date dimension lookup, then consolidated all customer filtering (address, demographics, and all three EXISTS conditions) into a single CTE before aggregation. This eliminates redundant date_dim joins and allows early filtering.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x
