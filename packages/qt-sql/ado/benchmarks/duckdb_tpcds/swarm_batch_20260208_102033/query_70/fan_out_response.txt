WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: safe_pushdown_and_materialization
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on safe predicate pushdown into CTEs and early filtering of dimension tables to reduce join sizes before expensive aggregations. Use materialized CTEs to avoid recomputation of common subqueries.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: date_dimension_isolation_decorrelation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate
HINT: Isolate date and store dimension filtering into separate CTEs with predicate pushdown, then decorrelate the top-5 state subquery into a standalone CTE for efficient joining.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_single_pass
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join date/store dimensions with fact data in chained CTEs, then consolidate aggregations into a single-pass operation before final rollup and window calculations.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform_union_exists
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Explore converting the IN subquery to UNION ALL branches, transform subquery patterns to EXISTS, and defer window ranking until after intermediate aggregation to reduce computation overhead.
