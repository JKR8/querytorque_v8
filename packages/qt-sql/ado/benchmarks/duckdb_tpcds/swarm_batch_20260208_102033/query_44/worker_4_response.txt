Changes: Eliminated duplicate subquery computation by extracting the shared store average threshold and item profit calculation into CTEs, then computed both rankings in a single pass using window functions, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.5x from removing redundant aggregation work and enabling better join optimization.
