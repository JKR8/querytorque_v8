Changes: Replaced triple EXCEPT with single-pass aggregation by combining all sales channels, building channel presence bitmap per (customer,date), then filtering for store-only patterns before final join.
Expected speedup: 2-3x by eliminating multiple DISTINCT operations and reducing fact table processing to one logical pass.
