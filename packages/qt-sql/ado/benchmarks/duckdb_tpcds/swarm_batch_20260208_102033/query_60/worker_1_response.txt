Changes: Created filtered CTEs for item, date_dim, and customer_address to push down filters early and avoid redundant subquery evaluations. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimization. All original semantics and output columns preserved.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x from reduced redundant scans and early dimension filtering.
