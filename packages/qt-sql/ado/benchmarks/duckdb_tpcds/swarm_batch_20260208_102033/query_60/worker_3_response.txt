Changes: Created pre-filtered dimension CTEs for items, dates, and addresses, then joined each fact table with all three filtered dimensions simultaneously in separate prefetch CTEs, followed by a single consolidated aggregation pass.
Expected speedup: 2.5-3.5x due to reduced dimension table scans, eliminated IN subqueries, and consolidated aggregation.
