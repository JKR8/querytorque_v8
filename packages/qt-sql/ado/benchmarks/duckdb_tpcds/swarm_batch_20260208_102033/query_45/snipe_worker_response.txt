**Changes**: 
1. Applied OR-to-UNION decomposition by splitting the OR condition into two mutually exclusive branches using UNION ALL.
2. Pre-filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address for zip condition, and item for item condition) into CTEs before joining with the fact table.
3. Used LEFT JOIN + IS NULL pattern in the second branch to ensure rows satisfying the zip condition are excluded, preventing double-counting.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x by allowing the optimizer to use focused access paths for each branch and reducing the initial join volume through early filtering.
