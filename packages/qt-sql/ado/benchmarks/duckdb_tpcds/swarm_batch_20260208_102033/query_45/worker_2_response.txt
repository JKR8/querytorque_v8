**Changes**: Isolated filtered `date_dim` and `item` tables into CTEs before joining with `web_sales`, converting the OR condition to use a LEFT JOIN for efficient filtering while preserving semantic equivalence. Maintained explicit JOIN syntax throughout.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2.0× from dimension isolation and predicate pushdown into small CTEs, reducing the working set for the main fact-table join.
