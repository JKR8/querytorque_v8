WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables before joining, push predicates into CTEs, and materialize the item subquery to avoid repeated execution.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item) into separate CTEs before joining with web_sales, enabling better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs, then pre-join with the fact table in stages; consolidate filtering logic to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_transform_decorrelate
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, decorrelate, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Split the OR condition into UNION ALL branches for better index usage, decorrelate the item subquery, and explore EXISTS transformations for the IN clause.
