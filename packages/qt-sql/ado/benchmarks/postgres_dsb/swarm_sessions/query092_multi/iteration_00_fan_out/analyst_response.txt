WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_join_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_JOIN
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for better optimizer control, isolate selective date filters early, and transform the correlated subquery into a join to enable more efficient execution plans.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, CTE_OPTIMIZATION_FENCE_MATERIALIZED, CORRELATED_WHERE_TO_DERIVED_TABLE
HINT: Use CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables and control evaluation order, then rewrite the correlated subquery as a derived table join to reduce repeated computation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, inline_decorrelate_materialized
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into CTEs first, then join; decompose the self-join pattern by computing the subquery aggregation once and reusing it.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_correlation_elimination
EXAMPLES: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_TO_WINDOW, CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL, AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN
HINT: Eliminate correlation via window functions or LATERAL joins, and push aggregations below joins to reduce data movement before the final filter.
