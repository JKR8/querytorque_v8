You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Query: query092_multi
## Dialect: postgres

```sql
select 
   sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)  as "Excess Discount Amount"
from
    web_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id BETWEEN 341 and 540
or i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music'))
and i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
and d_date between '1998-03-13' and
        cast('1998-03-13' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46
and ws_ext_discount_amt

## Top 20 Matched Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **inline_decorrelate_materialized** (timeout_rescue) — 
2. **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32x) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) 
3. **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93x) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both 
4. **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68x) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax. On queri
5. **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13x) — 
6. **pg_date_cte_explicit_join** (2.28x) — Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. The combin
7. **DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION** (unknown) — Decompose many-to-many self-joins into multiple passes with
      intermediate materialization for better cardinality es
8. **SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW** (unknown) — Replace self-joins used to access group-level values with window
      functions, eliminating the join entirely.
9. **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_TO_WINDOW** (High - single scan vs N scans) — Rewrite scalar subqueries computing group aggregates to window functions,
      eliminating correlated execution and ena
10. **CORRELATED_WHERE_TO_DERIVED_TABLE** (unknown) — Convert correlated subqueries in WHERE clause to derived table joins
      when PostgreSQL fails to decorrelate automati
11. **TOP_N_PER_GROUP_ROW_NUMBER** (unknown) — Use ROW_NUMBER() window function instead of correlated subquery
      COUNT for top-N-per-group patterns.
12. **CTE_OPTIMIZATION_FENCE_MATERIALIZED** (unknown) — Use MATERIALIZED to create optimization fence, preventing predicate
      pushdown and forcing single evaluation of expe
13. **AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN** (unknown) — Push aggregation below join when only aggregated values are needed
      from one side, reducing join cardinality.
14. **CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL** (unknown) — Rewrite scalar subqueries with aggregations to LATERAL joins, enabling
      the optimizer to select optimal join strate
15. **DSB_NON_EQUI_JOIN_WINDOW** (unknown) — Rewrite non-equi joins with temporal ordering into window function
      patterns for better estimation.
16. **DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS** (unknown) — Create extended statistics for DSB's intentionally correlated
      predicates that defeat independence assumption.
17. **EXISTS_INSTEAD_OF_COUNT** (30-40x faster in many cases) — Replace COUNT(*) > 0 existence checks with EXISTS for early termination.
      EXISTS stops after finding first match.
18. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_JOIN** (unknown) — Scalar/IN/EXISTS subquery in WHERE rewritten to JOIN
19. **GROUPING_SETS_INSTEAD_OF_UNION** (unknown) — Replace multiple GROUP BY queries with UNION ALL using single
      GROUPING SETS/ROLLUP/CUBE query for multi-level aggr
20. **NOT_IN_TO_NOT_EXISTS** (High - enables Hash Anti Join vs O(N²) SubPlan) — PostgreSQL CANNOT automatically transform NOT IN to anti-join due to
      different NULL semantics. NOT IN with any NUL

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep the matched recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from matched picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
