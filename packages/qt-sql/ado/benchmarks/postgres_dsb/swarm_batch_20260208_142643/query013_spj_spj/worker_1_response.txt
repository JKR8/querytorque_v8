**Changes**: Pushed selective dimension filters into separate CTEs (date_dim with year=2001, customer_address with country/state filters, customer_demographics with marital/education conditions, household_demographics with dep_count values), then converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This reduces the base fact table scan by pre-filtering dimension tables into small hash tables.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x. The date_dim CTE reduces date rows from ~73k to ~366 (factor 200x), customer_address from ~50k to ~3k (factor 17x), customer_demographics from ~1.92M to ~192k (factor 10x), and household_demographics from ~7.2k to ~1.8k (factor 4x). These small dimension CTEs enable efficient hash joins and dramatically reduce the store_sales scan.
