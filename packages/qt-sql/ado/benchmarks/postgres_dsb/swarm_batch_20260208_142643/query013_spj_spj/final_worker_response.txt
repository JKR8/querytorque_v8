**Changes**: Created separate filtered CTEs for each dimension table with their filters pushed down early, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and kept complex OR conditions in main WHERE clause with EXISTS checks for specific value combinations.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2.0x due to reduced intermediate result sizes from early filtering and better join ordering.
