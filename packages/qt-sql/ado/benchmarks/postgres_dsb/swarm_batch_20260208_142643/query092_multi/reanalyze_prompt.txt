You are analyzing 0 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

- **pg_date_cte_explicit_join** (2.28xx) — Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated j
- **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32xx) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter d
- **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13xx) — 
- **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68xx) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then 
- **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93xx) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggr

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
