FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts failed because they focused on syntactic reorganization (CTEs, explicit joins) without addressing the core physical execution bottlenecks. PostgreSQL's optimizer often inlines CTEs, making them optimization fences that prevent join reordering and predicate pushdown. The real bottleneck is the massive Cartesian product between date_dim self-join and fact tables before applying the 120-day range filter, causing explosive intermediate results. Worker 3's 0.13x slowdown demonstrates catastrophic materialization of large intermediate sets. All attempts kept the same join order (store_sales → store_returns → date_dim) instead of starting with the most selective filters.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Date dimension pre-join**: Materialize the filtered d2 (month=12) and directly join it with d1 (dow=1) using the 120-day range BEFORE joining to fact tables.
2. **Fact table filtering via EXISTS**: Use semi-joins to filter store_sales/returns by date keys before the full join.
3. **Aggregate early reduction**: Compute partial MIN aggregates on pre-joined subsets before final aggregation.
4. **Lateral joins**: Use LATERAL to limit fact table scans to only matching date pairs.
5. **Index-aware join ordering**: Force join order starting with the most selective dimension (store) then date pairs, then fact tables.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a materialized CTE for store-filtered date pairs, then use LATERAL joins to limit fact table scanning to only relevant rows. Pre-aggregate fact tables where possible and use explicit join ordering with index hints via table aliasing. Key steps:
1. Materialize store-filtered keys
2. Compute all valid (d1,d2) date pairs satisfying both filters and range
3. Use LATERAL to join each date pair to matching store_sales/returns rows
4. Push MIN aggregation into subqueries on reduced sets

EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize the date-dimension self-join with range condition first, then use LATERAL joins to fact tables with explicit LIMIT 1 where possible, and force join order from smallest to largest relations.
