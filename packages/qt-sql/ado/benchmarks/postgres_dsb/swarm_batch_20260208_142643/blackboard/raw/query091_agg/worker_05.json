Worker 1-3 used CTE-based filter pushdown but joined everything at once, forcing PostgreSQL to process the entire fact table. Worker 4's UNION ALL approach actually doubled the work by scanning catalog_returns twice. Worker 5's IN subqueries prevented join optimization. The common mistake was assuming CTE materialization alone reduces fact table access - PostgreSQL's op",
