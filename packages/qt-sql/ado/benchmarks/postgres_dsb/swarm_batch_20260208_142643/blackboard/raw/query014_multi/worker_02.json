  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short due to three core issues: 1) Worker 1 and 5 had fatal errors (ambiguity/timeout) from improper column aliasing and excessive materialization. 2) Workers 2-4 failed to address the root bottleneck: the triple INTERSECT in cross_items performs expensive set operations on large intermediate results before applying item filters. 3) The avg_sales CTE scans the same fact tables thrice (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales) without leveraging pre-aggregated data.
