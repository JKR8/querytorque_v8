  "why_it_failed": "All attempts failed because they over-relied on CTE materialization which creates optimization fences in PostgreSQL, preventing join order flexibility and predicate pushdown across CTE boundaries. Workers 1-5 essentially implemented the same strategy with minor variations: pre-filtering dimensions into CTEs then joining. PostgreSQL cannot reorder joins or push predicates across these CTE barriers, leading to suboptimal execution plans. The 0.73x slowdown in Worker 5 shows CTEs can actively harm ",
