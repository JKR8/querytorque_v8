You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, selective filters early in the query plan by converting implicit joins to explicit syntax and pushing date/dimension constraints down before the main aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (
    SELECT w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name
    FROM warehouse
    WHERE w_gmt_offset = -5
),
filtered_ship_mode AS (
    SELECT sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type
    FROM ship_mode

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date_range and dimension filters into CTEs, then join with the fact table using explicit JOIN syntax to reduce intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (

SELECT
    SUBSTRING(w.w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20),
    sm.sm_type,
    cc.cc_name,

    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk > 30 AND cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "31-60 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk > 60 AND cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "61-90 days",
    SUM(CASE WHEN (cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk > 90 AND cs.cs_ship_date_sk - cs.cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "91-120 days",

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefiltering
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then perform a single join pass with the aggregated results to minimize repeated scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (

    FROM warehouse
    WHERE w_gmt_offset = -5

### Worker 4: novel_conditional_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure the conditional aggregation using a decomposed approach—potentially splitting the fact table scan by date ranges or using UNION techniques to optimize the CASE evaluations.

```sql
WITH
  filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
