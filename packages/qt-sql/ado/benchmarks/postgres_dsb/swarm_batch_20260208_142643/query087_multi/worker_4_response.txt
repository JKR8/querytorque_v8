```
Changes: Replaced double EXCEPT with pre-filtered dimension CTEs and NOT EXISTS anti-joins. Base customer/date combinations are computed once from store_sales, then correlated filters check for absence in catalog and web sales.
Expected speedup: ~2-3x by avoiding triple scanning of large fact tables and enabling better join optimization.
