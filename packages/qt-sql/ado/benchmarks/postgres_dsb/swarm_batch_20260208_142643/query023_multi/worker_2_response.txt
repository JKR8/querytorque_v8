**Changes**: Restructured CTEs to isolate date ranges and filtered dimension subsets early, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and preserved all original logic while enabling better hash join planning with small probe tables.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.0x via reduced fact table scans and improved join order flexibility from explicit CTE materialization.
