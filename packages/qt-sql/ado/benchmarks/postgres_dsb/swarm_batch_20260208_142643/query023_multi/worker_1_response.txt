**Changes**: Created separate CTEs for pre-filtered dimensions (`filtered_dates_1998`, `filtered_dates_1998_m3`, `filtered_items`) to push selective filters early, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and preserved all original logic while reducing base fact table volumes.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x from early dimension filtering and reduced correlation overhead.
