**Changes:**
1. Created `filtered_dates` CTE to isolate March 1998 dates (tiny hash table)
2. Rewrote `frequent_ss_items` to output only distinct `item_sk` needed for semi-joins
3. Converted IN-subqueries to EXISTS semi-joins for short-circuit evaluation
4. Replaced implicit comma joins with explicit JOIN syntax
5. Flattened main UNION ALL branches into separate CTEs with pre-applied filters

**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x due to reduced dimension table scanning, EXISTS semi-join short-circuiting, and explicit join planning with tiny dimension CTEs.
