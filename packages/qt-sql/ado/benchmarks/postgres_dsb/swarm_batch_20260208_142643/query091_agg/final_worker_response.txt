Changes: Restructured the query into a three-phase pipeline: (1) Pre-filtered dimension CTEs with selective WHERE clauses, (2) A consolidated customer CTE that joins all filtered dimensions in one pass, (3) Pre-aggregation of catalog_returns using only the filtered date and customer keys before the final join with call_center.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by reducing the fact table scan to only relevant rows early and creating small hash tables for dimension joins.
