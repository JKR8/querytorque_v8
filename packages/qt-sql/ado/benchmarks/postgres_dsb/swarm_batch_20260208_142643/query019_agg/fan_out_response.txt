WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on pushing filters early into CTEs and converting implicit joins to explicit joins for better plan control. Minimize restructuring while improving predicate selectivity.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into materialized CTEs before joining to the fact table. Restructure with explicit joins while keeping overall query shape similar.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimensions and fact subsets separately, then join. Consider restructuring as multiple CTEs with strategic materialization for plan stability.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform query structure by separating filtering and aggregation phases. Experiment with CTE decomposition patterns that change the join order and aggregation timing.
