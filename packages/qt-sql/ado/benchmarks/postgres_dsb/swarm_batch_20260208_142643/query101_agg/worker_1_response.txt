Changes: Converted implicit joins to explicit syntax and created pre-filtered CTEs for dimension tables with selective filters (date_dim d1, item, customer_address, household_demographics). This allows early reduction of dimension table rows before joining with large fact tables.

Expected speedup: ~2-3x due to reduced join cardinality and better hash join planning with tiny dimension CTEs.
