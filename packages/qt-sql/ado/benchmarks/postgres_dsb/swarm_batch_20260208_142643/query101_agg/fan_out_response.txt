WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push selective filters (date, category, state) early into dimension tables, convert implicit joins to explicit CTEs, and pre-filter fact tables to reduce join cardinality before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs, then restructure the multi-fact join with explicit JOIN syntax to improve predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimensions and facts into separate CTEs, then join them in a star-like pattern. Decompose the multi-fact self-join to avoid redundant scans and leverage indexed accesses.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Break the complex multi-fact join into independent subqueries using CTEs, then intersect or union results structurally. Transform implicit join conditions into explicit EXISTS or derived tables for better plan flexibility.
