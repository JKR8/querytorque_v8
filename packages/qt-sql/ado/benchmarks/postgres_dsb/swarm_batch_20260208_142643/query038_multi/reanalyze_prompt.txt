## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.56x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply basic performance techniques: push filters early, convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs, and isolate selective date_dim filtering into a CTE for reuse across all sales channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    WHERE c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)
        AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
        AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
    INTERSECT
    SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimensional_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.58x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on dimensional pre-filtering by creating CTEs for date_dim and customer with applied filters before joining to fact tables, using explicit joins for better cardinality estimation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        fc.c_last_name,
        fc.c_first_name,
        fd.d_date
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_date fd ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer fc ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = fc.c_customer_sk
    WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
      AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
    INTERSECT
    SELECT DISTINCT
        fc.c_last_name,
        fc.c_first_name,
        fd.d_date
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN filtered_date fd ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer fc ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = fc.c_customer_sk
    WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialized_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (0.57x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact data into separate CTEs for each sales channel, then perform set operations, aiming to reduce repeated table scans and leverage materialization benefits.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)

    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_date d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk

- **Status**: pass (0.60x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform INTERSECT operations to EXISTS semi-joins or window-based deduplication, potentially using a single pass over customer/date dimensions with conditional fact table aggregations.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
),

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
