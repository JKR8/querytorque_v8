**Changes**: Transformed INTERSECT operations to EXISTS semi-joins by creating separate CTEs for each sales channel with pre-filtered dimensions, then checking for existence across channels rather than performing expensive set intersections.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x by avoiding multiple full scans and leveraging semi-join short-circuiting while maintaining exact semantic equivalence.
