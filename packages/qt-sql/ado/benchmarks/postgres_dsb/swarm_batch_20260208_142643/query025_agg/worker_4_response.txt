Changes: Applied novel_fact_aggregation_fusion by creating three CTEs that pre-aggregate each fact table (store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales) separately with their respective date filters before joining them together. This reduces intermediate row counts and eliminates redundant joins to the date_dim table.

Expected speedup: 2-3x due to early aggregation reducing the cardinality of fact tables before the complex multi-way join.
