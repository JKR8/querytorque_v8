**Changes:** Materialized selective date filters into two CTEs (`d1_filtered` for May 1999, `d2_filtered` for May-July 1999) and converted comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This creates tiny hash tables for date lookups and gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x based on similar patterns in reference examples (pg_dimension_prefetch_star achieved 3.32x, pg_date_cte_explicit_join achieved 2.28x).
