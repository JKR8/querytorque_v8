WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters down early, convert implicit comma joins to explicit ANSI JOINs, and pre-filter selective dimension tables (date_dim, item, customer_address) before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim filters into CTEs, then pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into CTEs, then restructure the self-join on date_dim by computing date ranges in a single pass before final aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_restructure_union_exists
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Restructure the query by replacing IN lists with UNION ALL subqueries, transform the date self-join into an EXISTS correlated subquery, and decorrelate any dependent joins.
