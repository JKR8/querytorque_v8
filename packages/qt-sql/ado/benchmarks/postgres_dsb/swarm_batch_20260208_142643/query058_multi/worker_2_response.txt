Changes: Isolated date_dim subquery into a materialized CTE and created pre-filtered dimension CTEs for item and customer before joining with fact tables. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: 2.5-3x from reducing repeated subquery execution and early dimension filtering
