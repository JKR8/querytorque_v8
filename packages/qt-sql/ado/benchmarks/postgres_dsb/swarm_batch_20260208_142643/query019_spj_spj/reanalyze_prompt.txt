You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_and_early_filter
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply predicate pushdown and convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, focusing on filtering date_dim and other dimensions early to reduce the fact table join size.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state = 'TX'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
)
SELECT
    MIN(i_brand_id),
    MIN(i_manufact_id),

FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk

JOIN filtered_customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN filtered_customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 2: moderate_date_and_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate the highly selective date_dim filter into a CTE and pre-filter all dimension tables (item, customer, address, store) before joining with store_sales to reduce intermediate result size.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
),
filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state = 'TX'
)
SELECT
    MIN(i.i_brand_id),
    MIN(i.i_manufact_id),
    MIN(ss.ss_ext_sales_price)
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
JOIN filtered_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize filtered subsets of all dimension tables AND the fact table in separate CTEs with aggressive pre‑filtering, then join only the necessary columns to minimize I/O and intermediate rows.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state = 'TX'
),
filtered_store_sales AS (
    SELECT ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk,
           ss_store_sk, ss_ext_sales_price
    FROM store_sales
    WHERE ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
)
SELECT
    MIN(i_brand_id),
    MIN(i_manufact_id),
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_join_reduction_via_exists
- **Status**: pass (0.09x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the query by replacing some joins with EXISTS subqueries, especially for the customer–address–store relationship, and decompose the fact table scan to avoid redundant joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
)
SELECT
    MIN(i.i_brand_id),
    MIN(i.i_manufact_id),
    MIN(ss.ss_ext_sales_price)
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
WHERE ss.ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM filtered_date d
      WHERE ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  )
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM customer c
      JOIN customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
      JOIN store s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
      WHERE ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
        AND c.c_birth_month = 1
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
