FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short due to PostgreSQL's CTE optimization fence behavior. Workers 1-5 used non-materialized CTEs (default behavior in versions prior to 12), causing the planner to compute each CTE independently without cross-CTE join optimization or predicate pushdown. This prevented join order flexibility and forced nested-loop-like execution patterns. Worker 4's EXISTS approach was catastrophic (0.09x) because it created correlated subqueries that executed per fact row. The common CTE-based filtering failed because: 1) PostgreSQL couldn't reorder joins across CTE boundaries, 2) selective filters weren't pushed into the fact table scan, and 3) the expensive substring condition on zip codes remained a late-stage filter without indexes.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Inline subqueries instead of CTEs** - Use derived tables in FROM clauses to allow full join reordering
2. **Selective fact-table pre-filtering** - Push date/item/customer filters directly into store_sales via correlated conditions
3. **Geospatial optimization** - Convert zip substring inequality to spatial join or range exclusion
4. **Partial/materialized CTEs** - Use MATERIALIZED hint for selective dimensions while keeping fact table in main join
5. **Index-aware restructuring** - Leverage known indexes on ss_sold_date_sk, ss_item_sk, and ss_customer_sk

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Use inline derived tables for highly selective dimensions (date_dim, item) while keeping the fact table in the main FROM clause. Apply customer/address/store filters via semi-joins using WHERE EXISTS with correlated subqueries that leverage foreign key indexes. Push the wholesale_cost filter directly into the fact table scan. Materialize only the most restrictive dimension (date_dim) to avoid repeated computation.

EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert CTEs to inline subqueries for date and item, use EXISTS for customer/address/store chain, and apply fact table filters before joins. Force materialization only on the date dimension CTE if selectivity is extremely high.
