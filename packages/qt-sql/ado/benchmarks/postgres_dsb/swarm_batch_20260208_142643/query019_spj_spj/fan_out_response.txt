WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_and_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown and convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, focusing on filtering date_dim and other dimensions early to reduce the fact table join size.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_and_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate the highly selective date_dim filter into a CTE and pre-filter all dimension tables (item, customer, address, store) before joining with store_sales to reduce intermediate result size.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize filtered subsets of all dimension tables AND the fact table in separate CTEs with aggressive pre‑filtering, then join only the necessary columns to minimize I/O and intermediate rows.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_join_reduction_via_exists
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform the query by replacing some joins with EXISTS subqueries, especially for the customer–address–store relationship, and decompose the fact table scan to avoid redundant joins.
