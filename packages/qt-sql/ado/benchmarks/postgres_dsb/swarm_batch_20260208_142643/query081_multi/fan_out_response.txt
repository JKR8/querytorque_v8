WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push state and date filters early into CTEs, convert comma joins to explicit JOINs, and pre-filter dimension tables to reduce fact table scans.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Isolate date and address filters into separate CTEs, then restructure the main query with explicit joins and pre-aggregated data to reduce correlation overhead.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered fact and dimension tables into CTEs, compute aggregates once, and restructure the self-join pattern to avoid duplicate scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_correlation_elimination
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the correlated subquery using a window function to compute state averages in a single scan, then flatten the query with explicit joins and early filtering.
