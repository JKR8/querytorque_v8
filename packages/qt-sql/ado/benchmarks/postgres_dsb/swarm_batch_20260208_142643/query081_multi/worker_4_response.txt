**Changes**: Eliminated the correlated subquery by precomputing state-level thresholds in a separate CTE using `AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2`, then joined these thresholds directly with the main CTE. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x due to decorrelation (removing per-row subquery execution) and maintaining early filtering on 'VA' state.
