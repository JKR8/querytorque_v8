WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters to earliest possible point, use explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining with fact tables.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Restructure CTEs to pre-filter dimensions and facts, use MATERIALIZED CTEs where beneficial, and isolate selective date filters.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension and fact tables into materialized CTEs, then restructure the self-join pattern to compute aggregations once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_self_join_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform the self-join pattern using window functions or pivot techniques, and pre-aggregate data to avoid repeated CTE scans.
