**Changes**: Materialized all filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) and the fact table (web_sales) into separate CTEs with early filtering. Restructured the self-join EXISTS condition using a pre-aggregated CTE (multi_warehouse_orders) and the anti-join NOT EXISTS using a precomputed distinct list (returned_orders), eliminating repeated full table scans.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x due to reduced data volume in joins and elimination of correlated subquery re-execution.
