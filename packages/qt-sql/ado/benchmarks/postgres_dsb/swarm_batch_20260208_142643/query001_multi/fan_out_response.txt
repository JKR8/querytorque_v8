WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, convert comma joins to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables before the main joins to reduce data volume.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Restructure using CTEs to isolate date and dimension filters, then materialize the filtered fact table to optimize the correlated subquery and main join.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then rewrite the self-join subquery to compute the average aggregation once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Decouple the correlated subquery by computing the average in a separate CTE, then use a structural transform (like a lateral join or window function) to compare individual returns.
