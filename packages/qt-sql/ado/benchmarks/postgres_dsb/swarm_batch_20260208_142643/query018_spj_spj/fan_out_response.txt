WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on pushing filters early into explicit JOINs, isolate selective date dimension, and convert implicit joins to explicit CTEs for better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs before joining, using explicit JOIN syntax and materializing filtered dimension sets.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into CTEs, then join, potentially decomposing for early aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_subquery_transform_union
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform IN-list to UNION/EXISTS, decompose MIN aggregates via subqueries, and use decorrelation with materialized CTEs for radical restructuring.
