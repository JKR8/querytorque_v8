WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and pushing down selective filters (state, date, price) early into the correlated subqueries and main FROM clause to reduce row volumes before grouping.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate the repetitive date_dim filter (d_year=2002, d_moy 3-5) into a reusable CTE. Pre-filter customer and address tables into separate CTEs before the main join and correlation checks to minimize repeated work.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_fact_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all dimension and fact table subsets (store_sales, web_sales, catalog_sales) into separate CTEs with their respective date joins and price filters. Then rewrite the EXISTS/NOT EXISTS logic as joins against these pre‑aggregated CTEs to eliminate repeated scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_exists_to_antijoin_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the NOT EXISTS subqueries into explicit LEFT JOIN … IS NULL anti‑join patterns. Consider rewriting the entire query as a single‑pass aggregation over customer dimensions with conditional LEFT JOINs to the three sales channels, using CASE or FILTER to compute the three counts without multiple scans.
