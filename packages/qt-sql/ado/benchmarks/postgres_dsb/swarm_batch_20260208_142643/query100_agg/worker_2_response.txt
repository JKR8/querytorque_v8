**Changes:** Isolated dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, customer) into filtered CTEs with their respective predicates, then joined with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax. This reduces intermediate row counts before the large fact table joins.

**Expected speedup:** 1.8–2.5x due to better cardinality estimates and smaller hash tables for dimension joins.
