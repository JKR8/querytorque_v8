You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push down selective filters (date, category, marital status) early into CTEs and convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and better plan choices.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2001
),
filtered_item1 AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men')
),
filtered_item2 AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 AND 100
),
filtered_cdemo AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
),

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate dimension tables (date, customer, customer_demographics) into filtered CTEs, then join with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax to reduce intermediate rows.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 1
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk
    FROM customer
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer_demographics ON c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
)
SELECT
    item1.i_item_sk,
    item2.i_item_sk,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM store_sales s1
JOIN store_sales s2 ON s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number
JOIN filtered_date ON s1.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_customer ON s1.ss_customer_sk = filtered_customer.c_customer_sk
JOIN item AS item1 ON s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk
JOIN item AS item2 ON s2.ss_item_sk = item2.i_item_sk
WHERE item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk
  AND item1.i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men')
  AND item2.i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 AND 100
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
- **Status**: pass (0.62x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into separate CTEs, then restructure the self-join to compute aggregated pairs from a single store_sales scan.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 1
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk
    FROM customer
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
),
filtered_item1 AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men')

    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 AND 100
),

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: fail (2.75x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Decompose the self-join by pre-aggregating store_sales, then join to items; use EXISTS for customer/dimension correlations and materialize intermediate results.

```sql
WITH 
-- Pre-filter date dimension for the year range
date_filter AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 1
),

cust_demo_filter AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'

-- Pre-filter item1 for specific categories
item1_filter AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_category
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men')
),
-- Pre-filter item2 for specific manager ID range
item2_filter AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_manager_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 AND 100
),
-- Pre-aggregate store_sales: filter by date, list price, and join to customer dimensions
-- This reduces the self-join to a single scan of store_sales
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT 
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 5: refined_snipe

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**:

    SELECT d_date_sk

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
