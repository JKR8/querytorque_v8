**Changes**: Isolated selective date_dim filter into a CTE, pre-filtered all dimension tables (cd1, cd2, customer_address) into separate CTEs using their respective filter conditions, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This creates small hash tables for dimensions before joining with fact tables.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x. The rewrite reduces the join search space by pre-filtering dimensions, allows better cardinality estimates, and enables more efficient hash join planning with smaller probe tables.
