WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters into the lowest possible join level, convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOINs for clarity, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining to reduce row counts early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate the selective date_dim filter in a CTE, then pre-filter other dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs (using MATERIALIZED hint) to enforce optimal join order and avoid repeated scans, then perform final aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Break the query into independent subqueries for each MIN() aggregation, then combine results, or transform implicit joins to EXISTS subqueries to leverage anti-join optimizations.
