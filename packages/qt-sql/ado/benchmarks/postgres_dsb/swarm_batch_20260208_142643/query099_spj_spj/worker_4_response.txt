Changes: Applied novel_structural_decomposition by creating independent CTEs for each dimension with their filters, then joining them to the fact table in a final CTE before computing the MIN() aggregations. This allows PostgreSQL to optimize each dimension filter independently and use efficient hash joins.

Expected speedup: 2-3x due to early filtering of dimension tables and better join planning with explicit JOIN syntax.
