**Changes:** 
1. Created `august_returns` CTE to filter store_returns to August 2002 using EXISTS with date_dim, avoiding materialization of the entire join.
2. Created `sales_returns_joined` CTE that joins store_sales with filtered returns on the most selective key (ticket_number) first, then computes date difference mathematically using integer keys.
3. Used EXISTS with date_dim to enforce the 120-day window without joining date_dim again, converting the date range condition to integer key arithmetic.
4. Aggregated at the fact level by ss_store_sk before joining to store table.
5. Preserved all original columns and ordering exactly.

**Expected speedup:** 2-3x by reducing join fanout through early filtering, eliminating redundant date_dim scans, and aggregating before the dimension table join.
