WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_join_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on safe, proven optimizations: push date filters early, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better planning, and ensure dimension tables are filtered before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim filters into CTEs, then pre-filter all dimension tables before joining with the fact tables. Use explicit JOIN syntax to give the optimizer clear join conditions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs to break up the complex join chain. Consider decomposing the date range logic to avoid repeated scans of the same fact data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_conditional_aggregation_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Explore structural transformations: pre-aggregate the sales/returns data before joining to store, or rewrite the conditional sums as a single pass over a derived table that computes the day difference bands.
