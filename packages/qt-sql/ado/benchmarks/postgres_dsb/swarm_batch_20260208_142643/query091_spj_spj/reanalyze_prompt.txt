## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push selective filters (date, demographics, address) down into the joins early, and consider converting implicit joins to explicit joins for better predicate pushdown control.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year = 1999 
      AND d_moy = 1
),

    SELECT cd_demo_sk 
    FROM customer_demographics 
    WHERE (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate highly selective dimension filters (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address) into CTEs or subqueries to reduce join cardinality early.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: pass (0.58x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize filtered subsets of all dimension tables and the fact table into separate CTEs, then join them in a star-optimized order to minimize intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1
),

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (0.45x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the OR condition in customer_demographics into a UNION, decompose joins to use EXISTS for selective dimensions, and restructure the query to avoid redundant scans.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
