**Changes**: Applied staged reduction with pre-filtered dimension CTEs (date_dim, customer_address, and one customer_demographics table) before the main fact table joins, creating a smaller intermediate result set for the complex OR conditions. This follows the pg_dimension_prefetch_star pattern from the examples.

**Expected speedup**: ~3.0x by reducing the join sizes early and giving the optimizer better selectivity estimates.
