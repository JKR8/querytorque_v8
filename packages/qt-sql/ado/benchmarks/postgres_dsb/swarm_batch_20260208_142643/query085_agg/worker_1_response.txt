**Changes:** Created three CTEs to pre-filter selective dimension tables (`date_dim`, `customer_demographics`, `customer_address`) before joining with fact tables, converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and preserving all original OR logic exactly.

**Expected speedup:** ~2-3x by reducing dimension table sizes early and enabling better hash join planning with tiny filtered dimension tables.
