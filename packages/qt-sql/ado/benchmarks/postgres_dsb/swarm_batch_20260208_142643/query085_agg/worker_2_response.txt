**Changes:** Isolated date filter (d_year=1998) and customer_address filter (United States with specific states) into separate CTEs, converted all implicit comma joins to explicit ANSI JOIN syntax, and pushed the ca_country='United States' predicate into the customer_address CTE.

**Expected speedup:** ~2.0-2.5x from earlier filtering of dimensions and better join planning with explicit JOIN syntax.
