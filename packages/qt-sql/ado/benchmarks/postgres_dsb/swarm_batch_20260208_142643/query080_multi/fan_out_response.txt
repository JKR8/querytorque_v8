WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push all dimension filters early into CTEs before joins, convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and ensure date range filtering happens first to reduce fact table rows.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Create isolated CTEs for filtered date_dim and other dimension tables, then join with fact tables using explicit JOINs. Consider materializing key CTEs to break complex joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into materialized CTEs, then join with each fact table separately. Decompose repetitive patterns to avoid redundant filtering.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform three separate CTEs into a single unified fact-union CTE with channel tagging, then apply dimension joins once. Use conditional aggregation for channel-specific metrics.
