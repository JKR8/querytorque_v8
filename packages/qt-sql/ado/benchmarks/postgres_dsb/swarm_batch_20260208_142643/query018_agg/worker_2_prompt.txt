## Optimization Strategy: moderate_cte_isolation_explicit_joins

**Your approach**: Isolate selective dimension filters (date, item, customer) into explicit CTEs, convert all comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and materialize only necessary filtered dimension subsets.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Compute rolled-up averages of catalog quantity, price, coupon, profit, and customer-birth metrics for 1998 Jewelry sales to college-educated female customers in selected states.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~90k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4, agg5, agg6] — ordered by ca_country ASC, ca_state ASC, ca_county ASC, i_item_id ASC
**Dependencies**: catalog_sales, customer_demographics (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), item (join)
**Joins**: cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk | cs_item_sk = i_item_sk | cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk | cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk | c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
**Filters**: cd_gender = 'F' | cd_education_status = 'College' | d_year = 1998 | c_birth_month = 1 | ca_state IN ('GA', 'LA', 'SD') | cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 52 AND 57 | i_category = 'Jewelry'
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  i_item_id,
  ca_country,
  ca_state,
  ca_county,
  AVG(CAST(cs_quantity AS DECIMAL(12, 2))) AS agg1,

  AVG(CAST(cs_net_profit AS DECIMAL(12, 2))) AS agg5,
  AVG(CAST(c_birth_year AS DECIMAL(12, 2))) AS agg6
FROM catalog_sales, customer_demographics, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
WHERE
  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"
from
   catalog_sales
  ,warehouse
  ,ship_mode
  ,call_center
  ,date_dim
where
d_month_seq between 1193 and 1193 + 23
and cs_ship_date_sk   = d_date_sk
and cs_warehouse_sk   = w_warehouse_sk
and cs_ship_mode_sk   = sm_ship_mode_sk
and cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
and cs_list_price between 271 and 300
and sm_type = 'REGULAR'
and cc_class = 'small'
and w_gmt_offset = -5
group by
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name

```

```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name, SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days", ... FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 AND sm_type = 'REGULAR' AND cc_class = 'small' AND w_gmt_offset = -5 GROUP BY SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 3. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `ca_country`
  3. `ca_state`
  4. `ca_county`
  5. `agg1`
  6. `agg2`
  7. `agg3`
  8. `agg4`
  9. `agg5`
  10. `agg6`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
