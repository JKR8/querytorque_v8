**Changes:** Created filtered CTEs for each dimension table with early predicate application, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and isolated the fact–dimension join in a single base CTE before the final ROLLUP aggregation. This reduces the working set before the expensive aggregation and gives the optimizer better control over join order and access paths.

**Expected speedup:** 1.5–2.0× due to early filtering reducing join cardinality and explicit joins enabling optimal join ordering.
