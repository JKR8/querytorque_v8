FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts used CTE-based dimension pre-filtering but failed because PostgreSQL's CTEs act as optimization fences, preventing join order optimization and predicate pushdown into the fact table. This forced nested loop joins and full fact table scans despite highly selective dimension filters (0.15% selectivity on store, ~1% on date_dim). The 0.65x-1.05x range indicates CTE overhead outweighed filtering benefits. Worker 4's 1.05x showed marginal gain from explicit column references but couldn't overcome the fundamental CTE limitation.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Lateral joins for fact table pre-filtering**: Use correlated subqueries to push dimension keys directly into store_sales filters
2. **Aggregate pushdown**: Compute min/max in subqueries before final join
3. **Partial indexes simulation**: Create filtered CTEs that emulate index-supported lookups
4. **Join order forcing**: Explicitly sequence joins from most-to-least selective using subqueries
5. **Column pruning**: Remove unused columns early from large dimension tables

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Combine lateral join for fact table filtering with dimension pre-aggregation and explicit join ordering. First pre-filter dimensions to get foreign keys, then use those keys in a lateral join to restrict store_sales before joining back for additional columns. Finally apply window-based min optimization for parallel aggregation paths.

EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Use lateral join with filtered dimension keys to restrict fact table scan, then compute aggregates in stages with column pruning. Sequence joins: store → item → date_dim → customer_demographics → store_sales via lateral.
