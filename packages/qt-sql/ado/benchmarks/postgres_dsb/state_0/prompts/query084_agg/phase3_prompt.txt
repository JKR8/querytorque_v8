You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query084_agg

```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id AS customer_id,
  COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income_band, store_returns
WHERE
  ca_city = 'Lakeview'
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ib_lower_bound >= 69452
  AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
  AND ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [customer_id, customername]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
