You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query050_agg

```sql
SELECT
  s_store_name,
  s_company_id,
  s_street_number,
  s_street_name,
  s_street_type,
  s_suite_number,
  s_city,
  s_county,
  s_state,
  s_zip,
  SUM(CASE WHEN (
    sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 30
  ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 30
      )
      AND (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 60
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "31-60 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 60
      )
      AND (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 90
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "61-90 days",
  SUM(

      WHEN (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 90
      )
      AND (
        sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk <= 120
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "91-120 days",
  SUM(CASE WHEN (
    sr_returned_date_sk - ss_sold_date_sk > 120
  ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM store_sales, store_returns, store, date_dim AS d1, date_dim AS d2
WHERE
  d2.d_year = 2002
  AND d2.d_moy = 8
  AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
  AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
  AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
  AND sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk

  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND d1.d_date BETWEEN (
    d2.d_date - INTERVAL '120 DAY'
  ) AND d2.d_date
GROUP BY
  s_store_name,
  s_company_id,
  s_street_number,
  s_street_name,
  s_street_type,
  s_suite_number,
  s_city,
  s_county,
  s_state,
  s_zip
ORDER BY
  s_store_name,
  s_company_id,
  s_street_number,
  s_street_name,
  s_street_type,
  s_suite_number,
  s_city,

LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [s_store_name, s_company_id, s_street_number, s_street_name, s_street_type, s_suite_number, s_city, s_county, ...]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[store]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
