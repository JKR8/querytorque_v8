You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query081_multi

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    cr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca_state AS ctr_state,
    SUM(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM catalog_returns, date_dim, customer_address
  WHERE
    cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 1998
    AND cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  GROUP BY
    cr_returning_customer_sk,
    ca_state
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id,
  c_salutation,
  c_first_name,
  c_last_name,
  ca_street_number,
  ca_street_name,
  ca_street_type,
  ca_suite_number,
  ca_city,
  ca_county,
  ca_state,
  ca_zip,
  ca_country,
  ca_gmt_offset,
  ca_location_type,
  ctr_total_return
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, customer_address, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state
  )
  AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  AND ca_state = 'VA'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id,
  c_salutation,
  c_first_name,
  c_last_name,
  ca_street_number,
  ca_street_name,
  ca_street_type,
  ca_suite_number,
  ca_city,
  ca_county,
  ca_state,
  ca_zip,

  ctr_total_return
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   customer_total_return (cte, 50% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_state, ctr_total_return]
-- Depth 1:
--   main_query (main, 50% cost) [GROUP_BY, CORRELATED] ← reads [customer_total_return, customer_total_return]
--     outputs: [c_customer_id, c_salutation, c_first_name, c_last_name, ca_street_number, ca_street_name, ca_street_type, ca_suite_number, ...]
-- Edges:
--   customer_total_return → main_query
--   customer_total_return → main_query
```

## Performance Profile

**customer_total_return**: 50% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[catalog_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address]
**main_query**: 50% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, HASH_JOIN, SEQ_SCAN[customer_total_return], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[customer]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

Phase 2 analysis identified these optimization opportunities:

- **customer_total_return** → apply **pushdown**
  Heuristic: 50.0% cost, flags=['GROUP_BY']
- **main_query** → apply **decorrelate**
  Heuristic: 50.0% cost, flags=['GROUP_BY', 'CORRELATED']

## Reference Example: pushdown

### BEFORE (slow)
```sql
[main_query]:
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) > 2972190 
  THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20)
  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20) END AS bucket1,
  CASE WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) > 4505785
  THEN (SELECT AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40)
  ELSE (SELECT AVG(ss_net_profit) FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40) END AS bucket2
FROM reason WHERE r_reason_sk = 1
```

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

### AFTER (fast)
[quantity_1_20_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20
```
[quantity_21_40_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40
```
[quantity_41_60_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60
```
[quantity_61_80_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80
```
[quantity_81_100_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN q1.cnt > 2972190 THEN q1.avg_ext_price ELSE q1.avg_net_profit END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN q2.cnt > 4505785 THEN q2.avg_ext_price ELSE q2.avg_net_profit END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN q3.cnt > 1575726 THEN q3.avg_ext_price ELSE q3.avg_net_profit END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN q4.cnt > 3188917 THEN q4.avg_ext_price ELSE q4.avg_net_profit END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN q5.cnt > 3525216 THEN q5.avg_ext_price ELSE q5.avg_net_profit END AS bucket5 FROM reason CROSS JOIN quantity_1_20_stats AS q1 CROSS JOIN quantity_21_40_stats AS q2 CROSS JOIN quantity_41_60_stats AS q3 CROSS JOIN quantity_61_80_stats AS q4 CROSS JOIN quantity_81_100_stats AS q5 WHERE r_reason_sk = 1
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
