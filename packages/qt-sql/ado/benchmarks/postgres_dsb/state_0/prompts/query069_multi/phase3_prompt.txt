You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query069_multi

```sql
SELECT
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt1,
  cd_purchase_estimate,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt2,
  cd_credit_rating,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt3
FROM customer AS c, customer_address AS ca, customer_demographics
WHERE
  c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state IN ('IA', 'MO', 'TX')
  AND cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND cd_marital_status IN ('S', 'S', 'S')
  AND cd_education_status IN ('Primary', 'Secondary')
  AND EXISTS(
    SELECT
      *
    FROM store_sales, date_dim
    WHERE
      c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
      AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      AND d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 3 + 2
      AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 100 AND 189
  )
  AND (
    NOT EXISTS(
      SELECT
        *
      FROM web_sales, date_dim
      WHERE
        c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
        AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND d_year = 2002
        AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 3 + 2
        AND ws_list_price BETWEEN 100 AND 189
    )
    AND NOT EXISTS(
      SELECT
        *
      FROM catalog_sales, date_dim
      WHERE
        c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk
        AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND d_year = 2002
        AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 3 + 2
        AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 100 AND 189
    )
  )
GROUP BY
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status,
  cd_purchase_estimate,
  cd_credit_rating
ORDER BY
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status,
  cd_purchase_estimate,
  cd_credit_rating
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
