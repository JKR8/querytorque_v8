You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query019_spj_spj

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(i_brand_id),
  MIN(i_manufact_id),
  MIN(ss_ext_sales_price)
FROM date_dim, store_sales, item, customer, customer_address, store
WHERE
  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND i_category = 'Home'
  AND d_year = 2002
  AND d_moy = 12
  AND SUBSTRING(ca_zip FROM 1 FOR 5) <> SUBSTRING(s_zip FROM 1 FOR 5)
  AND ca_state = 'TX'
  AND c_birth_month = 1
  AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [MIN(i_brand_id), MIN(i_manufact_id), MIN(ss_ext_sales_price)]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql
