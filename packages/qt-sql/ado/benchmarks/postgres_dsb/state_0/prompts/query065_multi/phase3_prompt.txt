You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query065_multi

```sql
SELECT
  s_store_name,
  i_item_desc,
  sc.revenue,
  i_current_price,
  i_wholesale_cost,
  i_brand
FROM store, item, (
  SELECT
    ss_store_sk,
    AVG(revenue) AS ave
  FROM (
    SELECT
      ss_store_sk,
      ss_item_sk,
      SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue
    FROM store_sales, date_dim
    WHERE
      ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11
      AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
    GROUP BY
      ss_store_sk,
      ss_item_sk
  ) AS sa
  GROUP BY
    ss_store_sk
) AS sb, (
  SELECT
    ss_store_sk,
    ss_item_sk,
    SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue
  FROM store_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11
    AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
  GROUP BY
    ss_store_sk,
    ss_item_sk
) AS sc
WHERE
  sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
  AND sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave
  AND s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
  AND i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
  AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 AND 36
  AND s_state IN ('TN', 'TX', 'VA')
ORDER BY
  s_store_name,
  i_item_desc
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [s_store_name, i_item_desc, revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
