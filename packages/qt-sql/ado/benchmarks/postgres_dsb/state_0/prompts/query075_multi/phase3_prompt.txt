You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   all_sales (cte, 50% cost) [GROUP_BY, UNION_ALL]
--     outputs: [d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt]
-- Depth 1:
--   main_query (main, 50% cost) [GROUP_BY] ← reads [all_sales, all_sales]
--     outputs: [prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, ...]
-- Edges:
--   all_sales → main_query
--   all_sales → main_query
```

## Performance Profile

**all_sales**: 50% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**main_query**: 50% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, HASH_JOIN, SEQ_SCAN[all_sales], SEQ_SCAN[all_sales]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

Phase 2 analysis identified these optimization opportunities:

- **all_sales** → apply **union_cte_split**
  Heuristic: 50.0% cost, flags=['GROUP_BY', 'UNION_ALL']

Nodes not flagged (low cost or no opportunity):
- main_query: No matching pattern for flags=['GROUP_BY']

## Reference Example: union_cte_split

### BEFORE (slow)
```sql
WITH wscs AS (
  SELECT ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ws_ext_sales_price AS sales_price FROM web_sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT cs_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, cs_ext_sales_price AS sales_price FROM catalog_sales
), wswscs AS (
SELECT d_week_seq, SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name='Sunday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales,
       SUM(CASE WHEN d_day_name='Monday' THEN sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales
FROM wscs, date_dim WHERE d_date_sk = sold_date_sk GROUP BY d_week_seq
)
SELECT y.d_week_seq AS d_week_seq1, ROUND(y.sun_sales/z.sun_sales,2)
FROM (SELECT wswscs.d_week_seq, wswscs.sun_sales FROM wswscs, date_dim WHERE date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq AND d_year = 1998) y,
     (SELECT wswscs.d_week_seq, wswscs.sun_sales FROM wswscs, date_dim WHERE date_dim.d_week_seq = wswscs.d_week_seq AND d_year = 1999) z
WHERE y.d_week_seq = z.d_week_seq - 53 ORDER BY d_week_seq1
```

**Key insight:** The original query scans the generic wswscs CTE twice and joins to date_dim twice to filter by year. By pushing year filters INTO the CTE definition, we create specialized CTEs (wswscs_1998, wswscs_1999) that filter during aggregation instead of after. This eliminates redundant date_dim lookups and reduces the rows aggregated.

### AFTER (fast)

```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
