You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query099_agg

```sql
SELECT
  SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20),
  sm_type,
  cc_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN (
    cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30
  ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30
      )
      AND (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "31-60 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60
      )
      AND (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "61-90 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90
      )
      AND (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "91-120 days",
  SUM(CASE WHEN (
    cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 120
  ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ">120 days"
FROM catalog_sales, warehouse, ship_mode, call_center, date_dim
WHERE
  d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
  AND cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
  AND cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
  AND cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300
  AND sm_type = 'REGULAR'
  AND cc_class = 'small'
  AND w_gmt_offset = -5
GROUP BY
  SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20),
  sm_type,
  cc_name
ORDER BY
  SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20),
  sm_type,
  cc_name
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,, sm_type, cc_name, 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, >120 days]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales], SEQ_SCAN[warehouse], SEQ_SCAN[ship_mode]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
