You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query025_agg

```sql
SELECT
  i_item_id,
  i_item_desc,
  s_store_id,
  s_store_name,
  SUM(ss_net_profit) AS store_sales_profit,
  SUM(sr_net_loss) AS store_returns_loss,
  SUM(cs_net_profit) AS catalog_sales_profit
FROM store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales, date_dim AS d1, date_dim AS d2, date_dim AS d3, store, item
WHERE
  d1.d_moy = 5
  AND d1.d_year = 1999
  AND d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  AND i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
  AND s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
  AND ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
  AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
  AND sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
  AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 5 AND 5 + 2
  AND d2.d_year = 1999
  AND sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk
  AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
  AND d3.d_moy BETWEEN 5 AND 5 + 2
  AND d3.d_year = 1999
GROUP BY
  i_item_id,
  i_item_desc,
  s_store_id,
  s_store_name
ORDER BY
  i_item_id,
  i_item_desc,
  s_store_id,
  s_store_name
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost) [GROUP_BY]
--     outputs: [i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_store_id, s_store_name, store_sales_profit, store_returns_loss, catalog_sales_profit]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
