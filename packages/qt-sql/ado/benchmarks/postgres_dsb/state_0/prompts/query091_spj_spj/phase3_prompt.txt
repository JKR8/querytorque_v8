You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query091_spj_spj

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(cc_call_center_id),
  MIN(cc_name),
  MIN(cc_manager),
  MIN(cr_net_loss),
  MIN(cr_item_sk),
  MIN(cr_order_number)
FROM call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
WHERE
  cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  AND d_year = 1999
  AND d_moy = 1
  AND (
    (
      cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
    )
    OR (
      cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'
    )
  )
  AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
  AND ca_gmt_offset = -7
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [MIN(cc_call_center_id), MIN(cc_name), MIN(cc_manager), MIN(cr_net_loss), MIN(cr_item_sk), MIN(cr_order_number)]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[call_center], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

Phase 2 analysis identified these optimization opportunities:

- **main_query** → apply **or_to_union**
  Heuristic: 100.0% cost, flags=[]

## Reference Example: or_to_union

### BEFORE (slow)
```sql
[main_query]:
SELECT ca_zip, sum(cs_sales_price)
FROM catalog_sales, customer, customer_address, date_dim
WHERE cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND (substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475')
       OR ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA')
       OR cs_sales_price > 500)
  AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

**Key insight:** Each OR branch becomes a separate query with focused predicates. Date filter is extracted as CTE and joined into each branch.

### AFTER (fast)
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

### When NOT to use this pattern
Do not split OR when all branches filter the SAME column on the same table (e.g., t_hour >= 8 OR t_hour <= 17). This duplicates the entire fact table scan for each branch with no selectivity benefit. Only apply when OR conditions span DIFFERENT tables or fundamentally different column families. Also never split into more than 3 UNION branches — each branch rescans the fact table. Caused 0.59x on Q90 (same-column time range split doubled fact scans) and historically 0.23x-0.41x on queries with 9+ UNION branches.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
