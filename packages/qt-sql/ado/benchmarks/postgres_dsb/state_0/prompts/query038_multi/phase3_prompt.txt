You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query038_multi

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    d_date
  FROM store_sales, date_dim, customer
  WHERE
    store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
    AND c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)
    AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
    AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
  INTERSECT
  SELECT DISTINCT
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    d_date
  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim, customer
  WHERE
    catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
    AND c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)
    AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
    AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
  INTERSECT
  SELECT DISTINCT
    c_last_name,
    c_first_name,
    d_date
  FROM web_sales, date_dim, customer
  WHERE
    web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
    AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1189 AND 1189 + 11
    AND c_birth_month IN (4, 9, 10, 12)
    AND ws_list_price BETWEEN 25 AND 84
    AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
) AS hot_cust
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [COUNT(*)]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[customer]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
