You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query094_multi

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS "order count",
  SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS "total shipping cost",
  SUM(ws_net_profit) AS "total net profit"
FROM web_sales AS ws1, date_dim, customer_address, web_site
WHERE
  d_date BETWEEN '2002-10-01' AND CAST('2002-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY'
  AND ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state IN ('IL', 'KS', 'LA', 'MN', 'MT', 'SC')
  AND ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
  AND web_gmt_offset >= -5
  AND ws1.ws_list_price BETWEEN 184 AND 213
  AND EXISTS(
    SELECT
      *
    FROM web_sales AS ws2
    WHERE
      ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
      AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk
  )
  AND NOT EXISTS(
    SELECT
      *
    FROM web_returns AS wr1
    WHERE
      ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
      AND wr1.wr_reason_sk IN (17, 48, 50, 56, 68)
  )
ORDER BY
  COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number)
LIMIT 100
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [order count, total shipping cost, total net profit]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

No specific patterns identified. Use your judgment.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
