You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: q1

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE
    sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

**Query Intent:** Find South Dakota customers whose total 2000 store-return fees at a given store are more than 120% of that store's average customer return total, and list the matching customer IDs in sorted order.

### 1. customer_total_return
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate 2000 store returns to one row per (customer, store), summing return fees as each customer's total return amount at that store.
**Stats**: 89% Cost | ~557k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return]
**Dependencies**: store_returns, date_dim (join)
**Joins**: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2000
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
  SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE
  sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY
  sr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk
```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Intent**: Compare each customer-store return total against 1.2x the same store's average return total, keep only South Dakota stores, join to customer, and output ordered customer IDs.
**Stats**: 9% Cost | ~539k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, CORRELATED_SUBQUERY(ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk), ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_customer_id] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery)
**Joins**: s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk | ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
**Filters**: ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk) | s_state = 'SD'
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[customer], CTE_SCAN, SEQ_SCAN[store], COLUMN_DATA_SCAN, CTE_SCAN
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. materialize_cte (1.37x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization: extract repeated subquery patterns into CTEs to avoid recomputation. When the same logical check appears multiple times, compute it once and reference the result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with ws_wh as
(select ws1.ws_order_number,ws1.ws_warehouse_sk wh1,ws2.ws_warehouse_sk wh2
 from web_sales ws1,web_sales ws2
 where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
   and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
 select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '1999-2-01' and 
           (cast('1999-2-01' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = 'NC'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_company_name = 'pri'
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select ws_order_number
                            from ws_wh)
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select wr_order_number
                            from web_returns,ws_wh
                            where wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)
order by count(distinct ws_order_number)
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[multi_warehouse_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
```
[returned_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL
```

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with year_total as (
 select c_customer_id customer_id
       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name
       ,d_year as year
       ,stddev_samp(ss_net_paid) year_total
       ,'s' sale_type
 from customer
     ,store_sales
     ,date_dim
 where c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
   and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
   and d_year in (1999,1999+1)
 group by c_customer_id
         ,c_first_name
         ,c_last_name
         ,d_year
 union all
 select c_customer_id customer_id
       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name
       ,d_year as year
       ,stddev_samp(ws_net_paid) year_total
       ,'w' sale_type
 from customer
     ,web_sales
     ,date_dim
 where c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
   and ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
   and d_year in (1999,1999+1)
 group by c_customer_id
         ,c_first_name
         ,c_last_name
         ,d_year
         )
  select
        t_s_secyear.customer_id, t_s_secyear.customer_first_name, t_s_secyear.customer_last_name

     ,year_total t_s_secyear
     ,year_total t_w_firstyear
     ,year_total t_w_secyear
 where t_s_secyear.customer_id = t_s_firstyear.customer_id
         and t_s_firstyear.customer_id = t_w_secyear.customer_id
         and t_s_firstyear.customer_id = t_w_firstyear.customer_id
         and t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's'
         and t_w_firstyear.sale_type = 'w'
         and t_s_secyear.sale_type = 's'
         and t_w_secyear.sale_type = 'w'
         and t_s_firstyear.year = 1999
         and t_s_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_w_firstyear.year = 1999
         and t_w_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and case when t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_w_secyear.year_total / t_w_firstyear.year_total else null end
           > case when t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_s_secyear.year_total / t_s_firstyear.year_total else null end
 order by 2,1,3
 LIMIT 100;

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
