## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 1.5-2.5x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.0x",

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

## Example: Decorrelate Subquery (DECORRELATE)
Verified speedup: 2.90x

### Input:
[customer_total_return] CORRELATED:
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (SELECT avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2 FROM customer_total_return ctr2 WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk AND s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "decorrelate",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_returns": "SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'",
        "customer_total_return": "SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk",

        "main_query": "SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100"

      ],

      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Push s_state='SD' filter EARLY into first CTE. Compute average as SEPARATE CTE with GROUP BY (NOT window function). Join on average instead of correlated subquery.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 2.71x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_reason": "SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'",
        "filtered_returns": "SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",
        "same result rows"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-002** - Correlated Subquery to Pre-computed CTE
  Trigger: WHERE col > (SELECT AVG/SUM/COUNT FROM ... WHERE correlated)
  Rewrite: Create CTE with GROUP BY on correlation key, then JOIN instead of correlated lookup
   Matched: Correlated subquery with aggregate comparison

2. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
DECORRELATE: [main_query] has correlated subquery
  Fix: Move aggregate to CTE, join instead of correlated lookup
  Expected: 2-3x speedup (verified Q1: 2.81x)

PUSHDOWN: [main_query] filters on [customer_total_return] after GROUP BY
  Fix: Push filter into CTE before aggregation
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q93: 2.71x)
