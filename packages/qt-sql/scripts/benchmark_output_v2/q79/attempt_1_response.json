Looking at this query, I see two main optimization opportunities:

1. **OR_TO_UNION**: The OR condition on household_demographics (hd_dep_count = 5 OR hd_vehicle_count > 4) can be split into UNION ALL branches
2. **DATE_CTE_ISOLATE**: The date_dim filter (d_dow = 1 AND d_year IN (1998,1999,2000)) can be isolated into a CTE for early filtering

The execution plan shows store_sales is being scanned twice and date_dim is heavily misestimated (66.9x). By isolating the date filter and splitting the OR condition, we can reduce redundant scans.

  "explanation": "Split OR condition on household_demographics into UNION ALL branches with mutual exclusion (hd_dep_count != 5 in branch2). Created CTEs for filtered dates and stores to push down filters early. Each branch can now use focused indexes and the optimizer can better estimate cardinalities."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. The OR condition prevents optimal index usage - splitting allows each branch to use appropriate indexes
2. Date filter isolation reduces date_dim scan from 73,049 rows to ~156 rows early in the plan
3. Store filter pushdown reduces store scan from 402 to 378 rows
4. Mutual exclusion condition (hd_dep_count != 5) in branch2 prevents duplicate counting while keeping UNION ALL (faster than UNION)
5. This transforms one large complex join into two simpler, more optimizable queries
