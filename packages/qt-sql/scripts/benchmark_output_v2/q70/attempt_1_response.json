  "explanation": "Extracted date filter into CTE to avoid scanning date_dim twice. Created sales_with_dates CTE that joins store_sales with date_dim and store once, reusing it in both main query and subquery. This eliminates duplicate scans of store_sales and date_dim, reducing I/O and join overhead. Also transformed the subquery to use the pre-joined sales_with_dates data."
