  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce web_sales rows early. The filtered_dates CTE returns only 366 rows (vs 73,049 in original scan), which when joined with web_sales significantly reduces the working set before expensive joins with small dimension tables (warehouse, ship_mode, web_site). This eliminates the 39.9x misestimate by making date filtering explicit and allows better join ordering."
