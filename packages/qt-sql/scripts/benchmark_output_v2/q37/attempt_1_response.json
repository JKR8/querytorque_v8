  "explanation": "Isolated date filter into CTE to reduce inventory scans early. Pre-filtered items by price and manufacturer. Converted joins to semi-joins (EXISTS) since only existence matters for inventory and catalog_sales. This avoids exploding duplicates from multiple inventory/sales records per item, reducing the need for costly GROUP BY elimination. Expected to reduce catalog_sales scan from full table to indexed lookups on filtered items."
