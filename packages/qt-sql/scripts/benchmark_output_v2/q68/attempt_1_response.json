  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: 1) OR_TO_UNION splits the OR condition on household_demographics into two separate branches (dep_count=8 and vehicle_count=-1) using UNION ALL, allowing each branch to use focused indexes and avoid full table scans with OR. 2) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE extracts date and store filters into separate CTEs, reducing the fact table join size early. Both transforms work together to reduce the multiple expensive store_sales scans shown in the execution plan."
