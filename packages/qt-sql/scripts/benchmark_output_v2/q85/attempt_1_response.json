Looking at this query, I can see two major optimization opportunities:

1. **OR_TO_UNION**: The query has two complex OR conditions (one on customer demographics and web_sales, another on customer_address and web_sales). These can be split into UNION ALL branches.
2. **DATE_CTE_ISOLATE**: The date_dim filter (d_year=2000) can be extracted as a CTE and joined early.

The key insight is that the two OR conditions are independent and can be decomposed into 9 combinations (3×3), but that would be complex. Instead, I'll use the OR_TO_UNION pattern on the first OR condition (customer demographics) since it has non-overlapping price ranges, and handle the second OR condition within each branch.

  "explanation": "1) Extracted date_dim filter (d_year=2000) into CTE to reduce join size early. 2) Split the first OR condition (customer demographics + web_sales_price) into 3 UNION ALL branches since the price ranges are non-overlapping (100-150, 50-100, 150-200). Each branch has specific marital_status and education_status. 3) The second OR condition (customer_address + ws_net_profit) remains within each branch since the profit ranges overlap and cannot be safely split without duplicates. This allows each branch to use more selective indexes on customer_demographics and avoid scanning the entire table multiple times."
