## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.0x",

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

## Example: Early Dimension Filter (EARLY_FILTER)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales
FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN sr.sr_return_quantity IS NOT NULL
        THEN (ss.ss_quantity - sr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price
        ELSE ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price END AS act_sales
      FROM store_sales ss LEFT JOIN store_returns sr ON ss.ss_item_sk = sr.sr_item_sk
      JOIN reason r ON sr.sr_reason_sk = r.r_reason_sk
      WHERE r.r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_reason": "SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'",
        "filtered_returns": "SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "output columns unchanged",
        "grain preserved",
        "same result rows"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.71x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

## Example: Materialize Repeated Subquery (MATERIALIZE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.37x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count,
       SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping
FROM web_sales ws1, date_dim, customer_address, web_site
WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01'
  AND ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state = 'IL'
  AND ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_returns wr1 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number)

### Output:

        "returned_orders": "SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns",
        "main_query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL"

      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.8x",

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract the EXISTS subquery into a CTE that finds multi-warehouse orders ONCE. Extract returned orders into another CTE. Join instead of nested EXISTS checks.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities
## Knowledge Base Patterns (verified on TPC-DS)
## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table

2. **QT-OPT-005** - Scan Consolidation
  Trigger: Same table scanned in multiple CTEs with different filters
  Rewrite: Single scan with SUM(CASE WHEN cond THEN val END) for each branch
   Matched: store_sales scanned 6 times

3. **QT-OPT-007** - Materialize Repeated Subquery
  Trigger: Same subquery pattern appears multiple times in query
  Rewrite: Extract to CTE with MATERIALIZED hint, reference by name
   Matched: Repeated subquery pattern
