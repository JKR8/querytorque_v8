  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into CTE to reduce join size from 73K rows to 31 rows early. Extracted item filter into CTE to reduce from 408K to 204K rows. This transforms the 3-way join into a sequence of smaller filtered joins, reducing the catalog_sales join cardinality by applying date and item filters first through CTEs."
