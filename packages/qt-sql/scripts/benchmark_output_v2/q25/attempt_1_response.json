Looking at this query, I can identify several optimization opportunities:

1. **Multiple date_dim scans**: The query scans date_dim three times (d1, d2, d3) with different filters
2. **Redundant joins**: store_sales is joined with store_returns on multiple keys, but these could be optimized
3. **Date filtering**: Date filters can be pushed down early

The biggest opportunity is isolating date_dim filters into CTEs and pre-filtering the fact tables before joining. This will reduce the data volume early in the query execution.

Pre-filtered fact tables (store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales) by joining with date CTEs early, reducing data volume before the main joins.
