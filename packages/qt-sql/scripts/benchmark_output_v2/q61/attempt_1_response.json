  "explanation": "The original query scans store_sales twice with nearly identical joins except for promotion table. Rewrite 1 extracts common filters into CTEs and materializes base sales once, eliminating duplicate work. Rewrite 2 additionally converts OR conditions on promotion channels into UNION DISTINCT to allow better predicate pushdown and index usage on promotion table."
