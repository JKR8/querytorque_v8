  "explanation": "Extracted repeated date subqueries into shared CTEs (target_week, target_dates) that compute the week sequence and corresponding dates once, then joined those precomputed dates in ss_items and ws_items. This eliminates redundant scans of date_dim (originally 9 scans) and removes correlated subqueries."
