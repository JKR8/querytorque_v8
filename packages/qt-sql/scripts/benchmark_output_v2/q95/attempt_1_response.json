Looking at this query, I can see several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The date filter can be isolated into a CTE
2. **IN to EXISTS**: Convert IN subqueries to EXISTS for early termination
3. **Pushdown**: Move filters earlier in the query
4. **Duplicate elimination**: The two IN conditions have redundancy

Key observation: The second IN condition references `ws_wh` and joins with `web_returns`, while the first just checks if order_number is in `ws_wh`. We can combine these into a single EXISTS condition.

  "explanation": "1. Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce join size early\n2. Created filtered CTEs for customer_address and web_site to push filters down\n3. Combined the two IN conditions: the second condition (IN with web_returns) implies the first (IN with ws_wh), so we can use EXISTS with web_returns directly\n4. Simplified logic by creating valid_orders CTE that checks both conditions in one pass\n5. This reduces repeated scans of web_sales and web_returns while maintaining same semantics"
}
```

**Key insight**: The second IN condition (`ws1.ws_order_number IN (SELECT wr_order_number FROM web_returns, ws_wh WHERE wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)`) actually implies the first condition. If an order number is in web_returns and also in ws_wh, then it's definitely in ws_wh. So we can combine these into a single condition checking for orders that exist in both tables, eliminating redundant checks.
