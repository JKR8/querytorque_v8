  "explanation": "Isolated date_dim filter into a reusable CTE (date_range). Both ssci and csci CTEs now join with this single date_range CTE instead of scanning date_dim twice with the same filter. This reduces repeated work and leverages date_dim selectivity early. According to plan, date_dim filter reduces 73,049 rows to 365 rows (200x reduction)."
