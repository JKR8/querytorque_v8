  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: (1) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE extracts date_dim and customer_demographics filters into CTEs for early reduction, allowing store_sales to be filtered early by foreign keys. This reduces the 34M row scan significantly. (2) OR_TO_UNION decomposes the OR condition on promotion into two branches, allowing each to use focused indexes/statistics. Combined effect reduces store_sales scanning and enables better join ordering."
