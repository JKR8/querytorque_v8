Looking at this query pattern, I can see it's identical to the DECORRELATE example provided. The main query has a correlated subquery computing a store-level average, and we can pre-compute this average in a CTE. Additionally, I notice we can push the `s_state = 'SD'` filter down earlier.

        "customer_total_return": "SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk",
        "store_avg_return": "SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk WHERE s_state = 'SD' AND ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_threshold ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100"
      },

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing store-level averages in a separate CTE (store_avg_return). This replaces the correlated subquery with a simple join. The s_state='SD' filter remains in the main query since it applies to store table which isn't part of the early aggregation CTEs."
