  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into CTE to avoid repeated scans. Materialized the repeated store_sales aggregation (appearing in both derived tables) into a single CTE that's reused. This eliminates duplicate work: the original query scans store_sales and date_dim twice for the same filter/aggregation. The rewritten version scans them once and computes the base revenue aggregation once, then reuses it for both the per-store average and the per-store-item revenue."
