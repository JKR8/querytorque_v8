  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into a CTE to avoid scanning date_dim twice. The original query scans date_dim once for web_v1 and once for store_v1. By creating a filtered_dates CTE, we scan date_dim only once and reuse the result in both CTEs. This reduces I/O and computation for the date dimension filtering."
