Looking at this query pattern, I can see three main optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation** - The same date filter (d_year=2002 AND d_moy=1) is used across all three CTEs
2. **Materialize Repeated Subquery** - The same IN subquery for i_manufact_id is repeated in all three CTEs
3. **Pushdown** - Filters can be pushed into the CTEs before aggregation

Here's my optimized rewrite:

    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Created three materialized CTEs: filtered_dates (date_dim rows for Jan 2002), filtered_items (manufacturers in Home category), and filtered_addresses (addresses with gmt_offset = -5). These CTEs are scanned once and joined in each sales CTE, replacing repeated subqueries and filters. This reduces multiple table scans: date_dim from 3 scans to 1, item from 6 scans to 4, customer_address from 3 scans to 1."
