## Example: Quantity Range Pushdown (QUANTITY_RANGE_PUSHDOWN)
Verified speedup: 2.11x

### Input:
[quantity_range_1]:
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_quantity) AS qty
FROM store_sales
WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 10
GROUP BY ss_item_sk

[quantity_range_2]:
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_quantity) AS qty
FROM store_sales
WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 11 AND 20
GROUP BY ss_item_sk

[main_query]:
SELECT i_item_id, q1.qty, q2.qty
FROM quantity_range_1 q1
JOIN quantity_range_2 q2 ON q1.ss_item_sk = q2.ss_item_sk
JOIN item i ON i_item_sk = q1.ss_item_sk
WHERE i_item_id BETWEEN 'A' AND 'Z'
  AND ss_sold_date_sk BETWEEN 2450816 AND 2450846

### Output:
```json

  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "pushdown",
      "nodes": {

        "main_query": "SELECT i_item_id, q1.qty, q2.qty FROM quantity_range_1 q1 JOIN quantity_range_2 q2 ON q1.ss_item_sk = q2.ss_item_sk JOIN item i ON i_item_sk = q1.ss_item_sk"
      },

```

**Key insight:** When multiple quantity-range branches repeat the same dimensional filters, push those filters into each branch to reduce scan and aggregation cost.

## Example: Remove Redundant Operations (REMOVE_REDUNDANT)
Verified speedup: 1.05-1.2x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT DISTINCT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total
FROM customer
JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk
GROUP BY c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
ORDER BY c_first_name

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "remove_redundant",
      "nodes": {
        "main_query": "SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, SUM(ss_sales_price) as total FROM customer JOIN store_sales ON c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk GROUP BY c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name ORDER BY c_first_name"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns",
        "same ordering"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.1x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** DISTINCT after GROUP BY on all selected columns is redundant - GROUP BY already produces unique rows. Remove to avoid extra sort/hash.

## Example: Join Reordering (REORDER_JOIN)
Verified speedup: 1.2-1.8x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price)
FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, item
WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND d_year = 2000
  AND s_state = 'TN'
  AND i_category = 'Electronics'

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "reorder_join",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_stores": "SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state = 'TN'",
        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Electronics'",
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price) FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_stores fs ON ss.ss_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension tables FIRST into small CTEs. Join fact table to filtered dimensions. Smaller dimensions reduce fact table scan.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

## Detected Opportunities

## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


## Node-Specific Opportunities
PUSHDOWN: [main_query] filters on [wswscs] after GROUP BY
  Fix: Push filter into CTE before aggregation
  Expected: 2x speedup (verified Q93: 2.71x)
