  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: (1) Isolated date_dim filter into a CTE (date_cte_isolate pattern) to reduce join cardinality early, (2) Converted the disjunctive OR condition into three UNION ALL branches (or_to_union pattern), each with focused predicates. This allows the optimizer to choose optimal join plans for each branch and leverages predicate pushdown. The date CTE is reused across all branches to maintain filter consistency."
