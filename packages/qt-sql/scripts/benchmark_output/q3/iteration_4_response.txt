Looking at the query and execution plan, I notice a key opportunity not yet exploited: **filtering the fact table (store_sales) early using the highly filtered dimension tables (item and date_dim)**. Currently:

1. store_sales is scanned completely (3.4B rows, 83% cost)
2. But item filters down to 51 rows and date_dim to 6,000 rows
3. The joins happen late, after scanning all 3.4B store_sales rows

**Transform: Create filtered dimension CTEs and push the join conditions down**

```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "reorder_join",
      "nodes": {
        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_manufact_id = 816",
        "filtered_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy = 11",
        "main_query": "SELECT fd.d_year, fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id, fi.i_brand AS brand, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk GROUP BY fd.d_year, fi.i_brand, fi.i_brand_id ORDER BY fd.d_year, sum_agg DESC, fi.i_brand_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same output columns",
        "same grouping and aggregation",
        "same ordering and limit"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Created filtered CTEs for dimension tables (item and date_dim) to reduce them from 408K→51 rows and 73K→6K rows respectively. By joining these small CTEs with store_sales early, we enable index usage or hash joins on smaller probe tables, dramatically reducing the 3.4B row store_sales scan to only matching rows. This is a classic star-schema optimization: filter dimensions first, then join to fact table."
}
```

**Why this should work better than previous attempts:**
1. **Massive reduction in store_sales scan**: Instead of scanning 3.4B rows and filtering later, we filter early using the small dimension CTEs
2. **Better join order**: Database can now build small hash tables from filtered dimensions and probe store_sales
3. **Index-friendly**: If indexes exist on ss_item_sk and ss_sold_date_sk, this rewrite enables index nested loop joins
4. **Parallel execution**: Small dimension CTEs can be materialized quickly, then joined in parallel

The key insight from the execution plan: store_sales scan is 83% of cost, and we can eliminate 99%+ of those rows by joining with pre-filtered dimensions.
