  "explanation": "Changed join order to start with the smallest filtered dimension tables (item filtered to 51 rows, date_dim filtered to 6000 rows) before joining with the large fact table store_sales. This allows hash join build sides to be much smaller, reducing memory pressure and improving join efficiency. The original implicit cross join with WHERE conditions prevented optimal join ordering by the optimizer."
