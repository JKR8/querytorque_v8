Looking at the query, I can see a key opportunity: the EXISTS subqueries all check for sales in **the same date range** (d_year=2001 AND d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 4). Instead of having each EXISTS subquery independently join with date_dim, we can create a reusable CTE for valid dates and pre-filtered sales data. This reduces repeated work and allows better join reordering.

**Key insight:** The OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS can be flattened into a single condition by combining them into one CTE of customers who had ANY sales in either channel.

Replaced EXISTS subqueries with efficient joins to pre-filtered CTEs, eliminating repeated date_dim joins and OR condition evaluation."
