  "explanation": "Transformed the OR condition (web_sales OR catalog_sales) into a UNION ALL with exclusion predicate to avoid double-counting customers that appear in both sales channels. The first branch handles customers with web_sales (and store_sales), while the second branch handles catalog_sales-only customers who don't have web_sales. This avoids the expensive OR join execution and allows separate optimization of each sales channel path. Added date_range CTE to isolate date dimension filtering and reuse across all sales table joins."
