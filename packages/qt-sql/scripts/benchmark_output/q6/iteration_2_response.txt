Looking at the current plan, I see the main cost driver is the sequential scan on `store_sales` (62.2% cost, 2.6M rows) with poor cardinality estimates (110.5x underestimate). The correlated subquery is also a significant opportunity (5.1% cost via LEFT_DELIM_JOIN).

Since previous iteration only achieved 1.07x speedup, I'll take a different approach: **materialize the filtered store_sales data early** to reduce the massive store_sales scan. This aligns with the "early_filter" transform.

      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "early_filter",

        "category_avg_price": "SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category",
        "filtered_sales_items": "SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales_items s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same ordering",
        "same column output",
        "same grouping and aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "2.2x",
      "risk": "medium"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Combined three optimizations: 1) Isolated the month_seq subquery into a CTE to compute it once, 2) Decorrelated the item price comparison by pre-computing category averages, 3) Introduced early filtering by creating filtered_sales_items CTE that joins store_sales with dates BEFORE the main query, reducing the store_sales scan from 3.4B rows to only dates matching March 2002. This should drastically reduce the store_sales scan cost."
