  "explanation": "First isolated date filter to CTE using date_cte_isolate (reducing date_dim scan from 2 to 1 with early filter). Then decorrelated item subquery by precomputing category averages in separate CTE, eliminating per-row correlated lookup. Both transforms push filters earlier and reduce repeated computations."
