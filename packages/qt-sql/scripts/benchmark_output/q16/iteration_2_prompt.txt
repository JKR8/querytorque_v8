## Example: Flatten Subquery to JOIN (FLATTEN_SUBQUERY)
Verified speedup: 1.3-2.0x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
FROM customer
WHERE c_customer_sk IN (
  SELECT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales
  WHERE ss_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000)
)

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "flatten_subquery",
      "nodes": {
        "target_dates": "SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000",
        "active_customers": "SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales JOIN target_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk",
        "main_query": "SELECT c.c_customer_id, c.c_first_name, c.c_last_name FROM customer c JOIN active_customers ac ON c.c_customer_sk = ac.ss_customer_sk"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same columns"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** IN subquery becomes a JOIN. Nested IN becomes chained CTEs. DISTINCT ensures no duplicates from the semi-join semantics.

## Example: Inline Single-Use CTE (INLINE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.1-1.3x

### Input:
[cte_a]:
SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000

[cte_b]:
SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_category = 'Music'

[main_query]:
SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price)
FROM store_sales
JOIN cte_a ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN cte_b ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "inline_cte",
      "nodes": {
        "main_query": "SELECT SUM(ss_sales_price) FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk WHERE d_year = 2000 AND i_category = 'Music'"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.2x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Single-use CTEs can prevent optimizer from pushing predicates. Inlining allows better join ordering and predicate pushdown.

## Example: Materialize Repeated Subquery (MATERIALIZE_CTE)
Verified speedup: 1.5-2.0x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count,
       SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping
FROM web_sales ws1, date_dim, customer_address, web_site
WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01'
  AND ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state = 'IL'
  AND ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_returns wr1 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number)

### Output:
```json
{
  "rewrite_sets": [
    {
      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "materialize_cte",
      "nodes": {
        "multi_warehouse_orders": "SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)",
        "returned_orders": "SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns",
        "main_query": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same aggregation"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "1.8x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract the EXISTS subquery into a CTE that finds multi-warehouse orders ONCE. Extract returned orders into another CTE. Join instead of nested EXISTS checks.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

OUTPUT FORMAT:

## Detected Opportunities

## Detected Optimization Opportunities

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:

## Failed Attempts (avoid these approaches)
- Iteration 1: Original query execution failed: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "cs_order_number" (use: "fcs1.cs_order_number" or "mwo.cs_order_number")

## Current Challenge
**Current best:** 1.00x speedup
**Target:** 2.0x
**Gap:** 1.00x needed

Try a DIFFERENT approach to improve upon the current best.
