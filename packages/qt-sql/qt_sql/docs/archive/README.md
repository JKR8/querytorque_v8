# Legacy Documentation Archive

This folder contains historical docs kept for reference only.

- These documents may describe pre-`qt_sql` namespace layouts (for example `ado`).
- They are not authoritative for current architecture or current commands.

Use `qt_sql/docs/README.md` for the current/canonical documentation.
