You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Top 5 FAISS Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93xx) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both 
2. **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13xx) — 
3. **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32xx) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) 
4. **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68xx) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax. On queri

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep FAISS recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from FAISS picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
