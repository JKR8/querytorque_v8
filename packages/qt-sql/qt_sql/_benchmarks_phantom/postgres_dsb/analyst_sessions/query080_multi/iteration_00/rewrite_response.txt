**Changes:** Created three materialized CTEs for filtered dimensions (date_dim, item, promotion) and rewrote each channel CTE with explicit ANSI JOINs to eliminate the Cartesian product bottleneck. This reduces dimension table scans from 9 to 3 and enables optimal join planning.

**Expected speedup:** 2-3× improvement based on similar patterns (3.32× in reference example).
