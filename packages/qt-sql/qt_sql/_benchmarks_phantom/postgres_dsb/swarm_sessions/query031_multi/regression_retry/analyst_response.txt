WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, CTE_INLINE_NOT_MATERIALIZED
HINT: Convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOINs and push all selective filters (date, item, address) directly into the CTE definitions, then inline CTEs to allow cross-CTE predicate optimization.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS
HINT: Create materialized CTEs for filtered dimension tables (item, date, address) before joining with fact tables, and add extended statistics for correlated predicates (color, manager_id, price ranges).

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_self_join_elimination
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW, AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN
HINT: Replace the triple self-join pattern with a single aggregation using window functions (LAG/LEAD) to compute quarter-over-quarter ratios directly, eliminating redundant scans and joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_channel_pivoting
EXAMPLES: GROUPING_SETS_INSTEAD_OF_UNION, DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION, CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL
HINT: Restructure to compute store and web sales in a single pass using conditional aggregation (CASE) with grouping by county/quarter/year, then use LATERAL joins to compute growth ratios without self-joins.
