WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on safe, proven improvements: convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs, push filters early into CTEs for date and item dimensions, and pre-filter customer/customer_address tables before the main grouping.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective dimension tables (date, item, customer_address) into explicit CTEs with their filters applied early, then restructure the main query with clear JOIN semantics while keeping EXISTS subqueries intact.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered fact data from all three sales channels into separate CTEs, then join once to customer. Consider collapsing the OR of EXISTS subqueries into a single semi-join against a unified sales dataset.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform the OR condition between web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS clauses into a UNION in a derived table or CTE. Alternatively, try converting EXISTS to IN with a deduplicated subquery and apply early decorrelation techniques.
