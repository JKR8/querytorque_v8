## Optimization Strategy: conservative_join_restructure

**Your approach**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins for better optimizer control, isolate selective date filters early, and transform the correlated subquery into a join to enable more efficient execution plans.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query092_multi_w1

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) AS "Excess Discount Amount"
FROM web_sales, item, date_dim
WHERE
  (
    i_manufact_id BETWEEN 341 AND 540 OR i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  )
  AND i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
  AND d_date BETWEEN '1998-03-13' AND CAST('1998-03-13' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY'
  AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46
  AND ws_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT
      1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM web_sales, date_dim
    WHERE
      ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN '1998-03-13' AND CAST('1998-03-13' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY'
      AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
      AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46
      AND ws_sales_price / ws_list_price BETWEEN 34 * 0.01 AND 49 * 0.01
  )
ORDER BY
  SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt)
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Sum web discounts over a 90-day 1998 window for targeted manufacturer/category conditions where discount exceeds an item-specific 1.3x baseline under cost/price-ratio filters.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [Excess Discount Amount] — ordered by SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) ASC
**Dependencies**: web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join)
**Joins**: i_item_sk = ws_item_sk | d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
**Filters**: (i_manufact_id BETWEEN 341 AND 540 OR i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')) | d_date BETWEEN '1998-03-13' AND CAST('1998-03-13' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY' | ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46 | ws_ext_discount_amt > 1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt) (per d_date_sk)
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) AS "Excess Discount Amount"
FROM web_sales, item, date_dim
WHERE
  (
    i_manufact_id BETWEEN 341 AND 540 OR i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  )
  AND i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
  AND d_date BETWEEN '1998-03-13' AND CAST('1998-03-13' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY'
  AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
  AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46
  AND ws_ext_discount_amt > (
    SELECT
      1.3 * AVG(ws_ext_discount_amt)
    FROM web_sales, date_dim
    WHERE
      ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND d_date BETWEEN '1998-03-13' AND CAST('1998-03-13' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY'
      AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
      AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 26 AND 46
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"
from
   catalog_sales
  ,warehouse
  ,ship_mode
  ,call_center
  ,date_dim
where
d_month_seq between 1193 and 1193 + 23
and cs_ship_date_sk   = d_date_sk
and cs_warehouse_sk   = w_warehouse_sk
and cs_ship_mode_sk   = sm_ship_mode_sk
and cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
and cs_list_price between 271 and 300
and sm_type = 'REGULAR'
and cc_class = 'small'
and w_gmt_offset = -5
group by
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1216
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name, SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days", ... FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 AND sm_type = 'REGULAR' AND cc_class = 'small' AND w_gmt_offset = -5 GROUP BY SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

**BEFORE (slow):**

LIMIT 100
```

**BEFORE (slow):**

SELECT t1.id, t1.name FROM t1 WHERE t1.x IN (SELECT t2.y FROM t2 WHERE t2.active = true)
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

## Filter Pushdown Heuristic

SQL optimizers CANNOT push filters through multi-level CTEs, window functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or UNION ALL boundaries. You must move them manually. Apply these rules:

1. **Static filter on CTE output → move inside CTE**
   If the final SELECT (or an outer CTE) filters on a column produced by an inner CTE with a literal/constant value, move that WHERE clause inside the CTE definition. This reduces the intermediate result set.

2. **Date/dimension filter → push to earliest scan**
   If a date or dimension filter appears in the final query, push it into the CTE that first joins with the dimension table. Pre-filtering the dimension table into a small CTE and joining early is even better.

3. **Repeated filter across CTEs → extract shared CTE**
   If the same filter predicate (e.g., `d_year = 2001`) appears in multiple subqueries or CTEs, extract the filtered result into one shared CTE and reference it everywhere.

4. **Filter after GROUP BY → push before GROUP BY**
   If a HAVING clause or post-aggregation filter can be expressed as a pre-aggregation WHERE, move it before GROUP BY to reduce rows entering the aggregation.

5. **Filter after window function → cannot push through**
   Window functions require the full partition to compute. Do NOT push filters before window functions unless the filter is on partition columns only (which narrows partitions without changing results).

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**PG_OR_TO_UNION_BLOCK**
POSTGRESQL RULE: NEVER use OR→UNION on PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL handles OR conditions efficiently via BitmapOr index scans in a single pass. Converting OR to UNION ALL forces multiple scans of fact tables and causes catastrophic regressions (0.21x-0.26x observed on DSB benchmark). Keep the original OR structure.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PG_CTE_DUPLICATION_BLOCK**
POSTGRESQL RULE: NEVER duplicate a CTE body to push a single-column filter inside. If the original has one CTE referenced multiple times, keep it as one CTE and filter in the WHERE clause. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs, so computing an expensive multi-table join twice is always worse than computing once and filtering. Observed 0.65x regression on 18-table CTE duplication.

**PG_EXISTS_TO_IN_BLOCK**
POSTGRESQL RULE: NEVER convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS to IN/NOT IN with materialized CTEs. PostgreSQL uses efficient semi-join with early termination for EXISTS. Materializing DISTINCT keys from fact tables forces full scans and loses the early-termination benefit. Observed 0.50x-0.86x regressions.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

**PG_DATE_CTE_CAUTION**
POSTGRESQL RULE: date_cte_isolate is ONLY beneficial when combined with converting comma-joins to explicit JOINs on star-schema queries. DO NOT use it on queries with EXISTS/NOT EXISTS (kills semi-join), INTERSECT/EXCEPT (adds CTE overhead per branch), or when the query already has efficient CTEs. If applying to UNION ALL branches, apply to ALL or NONE.

**PG_LOOSE_PREFILTER_BLOCK**
POSTGRESQL RULE: Do NOT pre-filter fact tables into CTEs when the WHERE has correlated OR conditions (the union/superset filter materializes too many rows, 0.79x regression). BUT DO pre-filter fact tables when the query has expensive non-equi joins (quantity comparisons, date arithmetic) - reducing the fact table before these joins is highly effective (2.68x win on Q072).

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Excess Discount Amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
