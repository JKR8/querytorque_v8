**Changes**: Pre-filtered dimension tables (`date_dim`, `item`) into separate CTEs, then decorrelated the subquery by computing per-item average discounts in a CTE and joining it. This eliminates repeated correlated execution while preserving semantics with `COALESCE` for items with no matching subquery rows.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x from eliminating correlated subquery overhead and enabling better join optimization with pre-filtered dimension CTEs.
