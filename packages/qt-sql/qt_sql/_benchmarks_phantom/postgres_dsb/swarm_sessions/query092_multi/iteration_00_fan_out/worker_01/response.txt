**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit joins, isolated selective date and item filters into CTEs for early reduction, and decorrelated the subquery by precomputing item average discounts. Added explicit `GROUP BY ()` to clarify global aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x from reduced join sizes, early filtering, and elimination of correlated subquery execution.
