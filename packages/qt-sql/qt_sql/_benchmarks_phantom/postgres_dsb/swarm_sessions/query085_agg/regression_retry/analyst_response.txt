WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, FILTER_INTO_JOIN, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Apply safe predicate pushdown by isolating date_dim filter first, converting implicit joins to explicit syntax, and pushing filters directly into join conditions to reduce rows early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN
HINT: Pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs before joining, materialize selective filters, and explore pushing partial aggregation below joins to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_structural_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION, inline_decorrelate_materialized
HINT: Break the complex OR conditions by decomposing the query into multiple CTEs using UNION ALL patterns, eliminate duplicate fact scans, and materialize intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_restructure
EXAMPLES: EXISTS_SUBPLAN_TO_SEMI_JOIN, GROUPING_SETS_INSTEAD_OF_UNION, JOIN_ORDER_COLLAPSE_LIMIT
HINT: Convert OR predicates to UNION ALL branches, use semi-join transformations for correlation, and control join order to isolate expensive predicate combinations.
