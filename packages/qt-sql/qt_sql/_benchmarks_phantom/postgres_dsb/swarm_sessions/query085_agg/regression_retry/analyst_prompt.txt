You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Top 20 Matched Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32x) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) 
2. **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13x) — 
3. **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68x) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax. On queri
4. **inline_decorrelate_materialized** (timeout_rescue) — 
5. **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93x) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both 
6. **pg_date_cte_explicit_join** (2.28x) — Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. The combin
7. **AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN** (unknown) — Push aggregation below join when only aggregated values are needed
      from one side, reducing join cardinality.
8. **DSB_NON_EQUI_JOIN_WINDOW** (unknown) — Rewrite non-equi joins with temporal ordering into window function
      patterns for better estimation.
9. **DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION** (unknown) — Decompose many-to-many self-joins into multiple passes with
      intermediate materialization for better cardinality es
10. **SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW** (unknown) — Replace self-joins used to access group-level values with window
      functions, eliminating the join entirely.
11. **AGGREGATE_PULL_UP_CONSTANTS** (unknown) — Pull up constant GROUP BY keys (SF=100 cited)
12. **DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS** (unknown) — Create extended statistics for DSB's intentionally correlated
      predicates that defeat independence assumption.
13. **WINDOW_SORT_ALIGNMENT** (unknown) — Align window function ORDER BY clauses to minimize sorts when
      multiple window functions are used in same query.
14. **GROUPING_SETS_INSTEAD_OF_UNION** (unknown) — Replace multiple GROUP BY queries with UNION ALL using single
      GROUPING SETS/ROLLUP/CUBE query for multi-level aggr

      NULL should equal NULL.
19. **JOIN_ORDER_COLLAPSE_LIMIT** (unknown) — Set join_collapse_limit = 1 to force PostgreSQL to respect explicit
      JOIN clause ordering instead of reordering for

      it's optimal (small outer table, indexed inner

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep the matched recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from matched picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
