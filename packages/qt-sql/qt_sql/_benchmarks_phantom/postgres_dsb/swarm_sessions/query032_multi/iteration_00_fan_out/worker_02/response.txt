**Changes**: Created CTEs to pre-filter date_dim and item tables, decorrelated the subquery into a separate CTE computing per-item thresholds, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better join order control.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3x by reducing dimension table sizes early, eliminating correlated subquery execution per row, and giving the optimizer better cardinality estimates through materialized CTEs.
