You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Query: query038_multi
## Dialect: postgres

```sql
select  count(*) from (
    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    from store_sales, date_dim, customer
          where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk

## Top 20 Matched Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32x) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) 
2. **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13x) — 
3. **inline_decorrelate_materialized** (timeout_rescue) — 
4. **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93x) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both 
5. **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68x) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax. On queri
6. **pg_date_cte_explicit_join** (2.28x) — Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. The combin
7. **DSB_NON_EQUI_JOIN_WINDOW** (unknown) — Rewrite non-equi joins with temporal ordering into window function
      patterns for better estimation.
8. **DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS** (unknown) — Create extended statistics for DSB's intentionally correlated
      predicates that defeat independence assumption.
9. **DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION** (unknown) — Decompose many-to-many self-joins into multiple passes with
      intermediate materialization for better cardinality es
10. **SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW** (unknown) — Replace self-joins used to access group-level values with window
      functions, eliminating the join entirely.
11. **AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN** (unknown) — Push aggregation below join when only aggregated values are needed
      from one side, reducing join cardinality.
12. **CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL** (unknown) — Rewrite scalar subqueries with aggregations to LATERAL joins, enabling
      the optimizer to select optimal join strate
13. **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_TO_WINDOW** (High - single scan vs N scans) — Rewrite scalar subqueries computing group aggregates to window functions,
      eliminating correlated execution and ena
14. **CORRELATED_WHERE_TO_DERIVED_TABLE** (unknown) — Convert correlated subqueries in WHERE clause to derived table joins
      when PostgreSQL fails to decorrelate automati
15. **EXISTS_INSTEAD_OF_COUNT** (30-40x faster in many cases) — Replace COUNT(*) > 0 existence checks with EXISTS for early termination.
      EXISTS stops after finding first match.
16. **FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_JOIN** (unknown) — Scalar/IN/EXISTS subquery in WHERE rewritten to JOIN
17. **NOT_IN_TO_NOT_EXISTS** (High - enables Hash Anti Join vs O(N²) SubPlan) — PostgreSQL CANNOT automatically transform NOT IN to anti-join due to
      different NULL semantics. NOT IN with any NUL
18. **SUBQUERY_OFFSET_ZERO_BARRIER** (unknown) — Add OFFSET 0 to subquery to create optimization barrier preventing
      subquery pull-up, forcing materialization and s
19. **TOP_N_PER_GROUP_ROW_NUMBER** (unknown) — Use ROW_NUMBER() window function instead of correlated subquery
      COUNT for top-N-per-group patterns.
20. **AGGREGATE_PULL_UP_CONSTANTS** (unknown) — Pull up constant GROUP BY keys (SF=100 cited)

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep the matched recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from matched picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
