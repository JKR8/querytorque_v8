## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
- **Status**: pass (1.19x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into the lowest possible join level, convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOINs for clarity, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining to reduce row counts early.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (
    SELECT w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name
    FROM warehouse
    WHERE w_gmt_offset = -5
),
filtered_ship_mode AS (
    SELECT sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type
    FROM ship_mode
    WHERE sm_type = 'REGULAR'
),
filtered_call_center AS (
    SELECT cc_call_center_sk, cc_name
    FROM call_center
    WHERE cc_class = 'small'

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate the selective date_dim filter in a CTE, then pre-filter other dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table to minimize intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (
    SELECT w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name
    FROM warehouse
    WHERE w_gmt_offset = -5
),
filtered_ship_mode AS (
    SELECT sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type
    FROM ship_mode
    WHERE sm_type = 'REGULAR'
),

    SELECT cc_call_center_sk, cc_name
    FROM call_center
    WHERE cc_class = 'small'
)
SELECT
    MIN(w_warehouse_name),
    MIN(sm_type),
    MIN(cc_name),
    MIN(cs_order_number),
    MIN(cs_item_sk)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON cs_ship_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = filtered_warehouse.w_warehouse_sk
JOIN filtered_ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = filtered_ship_mode.sm_ship_mode_sk
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs (using MATERIALIZED hint) to enforce optimal join order and avoid repeated scans, then perform final aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),
filtered_warehouse AS (
    SELECT w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name
    FROM warehouse
    WHERE w_gmt_offset = -5

    SELECT sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type
    FROM ship_mode
    WHERE sm_type = 'REGULAR'

    WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 4: novel_structural_decomposition
- **Status**: pass (1.18x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Break the query into independent subqueries for each MIN() aggregation, then combine results, or transform implicit joins to EXISTS subqueries to leverage anti-join optimizations.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23
),

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
