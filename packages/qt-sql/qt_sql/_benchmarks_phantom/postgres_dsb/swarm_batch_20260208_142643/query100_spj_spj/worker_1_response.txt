**Changes:** Converted comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax and created separate CTEs for each selective dimension table (date_dim, both item filters, customer_demographics) to push filters early. Maintained all original logic including the item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk inequality.

**Expected speedup:** ~2-3x from better join planning and early filtering of dimension tables.
