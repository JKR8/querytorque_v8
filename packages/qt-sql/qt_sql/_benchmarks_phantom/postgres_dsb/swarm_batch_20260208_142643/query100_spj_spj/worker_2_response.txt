Changes: Isolated selective date_dim and customer_demographics filters into separate CTEs, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and restructured the join order to avoid Cartesian products.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x due to reduced early row multiplication and better hash join planning with pre-filtered dimension tables.
