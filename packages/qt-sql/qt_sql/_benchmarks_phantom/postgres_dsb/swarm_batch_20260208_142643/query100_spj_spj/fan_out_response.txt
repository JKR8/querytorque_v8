WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown and convert comma joins to explicit JOINs for better planner optimization while maintaining safe, predictable transformations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim and customer demographic filters into CTEs, then restructure joins to reduce early Cartesian products.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_materialized_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact table subsets into CTEs before joining, aggressively reducing row counts before the self-join.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_self_join_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Break the self-join pattern by computing aggregated ticket-level metrics first, then join to items separately to eliminate duplicate fact table scans.
