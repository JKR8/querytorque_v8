### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter

              ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Apply selective dimension table filtering early using CTEs or derived tables, while maintaining the original join structure and OR logic.

    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_isolation

- **Error**: column "ca_state" does not exist
LINE 50:         ca_state IN ('IA', 'PA', 'TX')

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate key dimension filters (date, demographics) into explicit CTEs, then rewrite implicit comma joins as explicit ANSI joins for better predicate pushdown.

- **Status**: pass (0.32x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs with aggressive predicate application before final joins.

    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

- **Status**: pass (0.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the complex OR conditions into UNION ALL subqueries to enable separate optimization paths, then apply self-join elimination and materialization.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
