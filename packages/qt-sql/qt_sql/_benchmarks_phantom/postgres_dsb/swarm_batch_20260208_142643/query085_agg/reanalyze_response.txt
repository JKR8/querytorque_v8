FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
The primary failure mechanism was a column resolution error ("column 'ca_state' does not exist") that occurred in 3/5 attempts. This happened because workers created CTEs for filtered dimension tables (like customer_address) but only selected a subset of columns (e.g., just `ca_address_sk`), then referenced additional columns (like `ca_state`) from these CTEs in the main query's WHERE clause. Attempts 1, 2, and 5 all made this same structural mistake by referencing columns from CTEs that weren't included in their SELECT lists. The attempts that passed (3 and 4) avoided this error but suffered from poor performance (0.32x, 0.05x) due to suboptimal execution plans - likely from materializing too much data early or creating overly complex UNION structures that the optimizer couldn't handle efficiently.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Hybrid filter pushdown with column preservation**: Pre-filter dimension tables while keeping all columns needed for later conditions, avoiding the column missing error while enabling predicate pushdown.
2. **Materialized lateral joins**: Use LATERAL joins to filter fact tables based on dimension conditions without losing column references.
3. **Selective fact table filtering first**: Start with the most restrictive fact table (web_sales) filters, then join to dimensions, reversing the typical dimension-first approach.
4. **Partial predicate evaluation**: Break the complex OR conditions into component parts that can be evaluated at different join stages.
5. **Index-aware join ordering**: Reorder joins based on filter selectivity rather than following the original query structure.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a multi-stage filtering approach that: (1) starts with the most selective fact table (web_sales) using its price/profit ranges, (2) joins to web_returns early to reduce the join fanout, (3) uses preserved-column CTEs for dimensions that maintain all necessary columns for later filtering, (4) applies dimension filters in stages rather than all at once, and (5) avoids materialization overhead by using derived tables instead of CTEs where possible. The key insight is to preserve the column structure while enabling filter pushdown by using inline derived tables with explicit column selection that matches all reference needs.

EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Start with web_sales filtered by ws_sales_price BETWEEN 50 AND 200 and ws_net_profit BETWEEN 50 AND 300 (covering all OR branches), then join to web_returns, then to dimension tables using derived tables that preserve all needed columns (ca_state, cd_marital_status, etc.), and finally apply the remaining complex OR conditions as a single WHERE clause on the fully joined set.
