**Changes**: Materialized aggressively filtered dimension tables (`filtered_date`, `filtered_cd1`, `filtered_ca`) and pre-filtered fact tables (`filtered_web_sales`, `filtered_web_returns`) into separate CTEs before final joins. Applied all possible filters within each CTE and simplified the final WHERE clause by deduplicating state conditions.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.5x by reducing large table scans early through CTE materialization and pushing down filters.
