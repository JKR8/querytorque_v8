WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Apply selective dimension table filtering early using CTEs or derived tables, while maintaining the original join structure and OR logic.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Isolate key dimension filters (date, demographics) into explicit CTEs, then rewrite implicit comma joins as explicit ANSI joins for better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs with aggressive predicate application before final joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform the complex OR conditions into UNION ALL subqueries to enable separate optimization paths, then apply self-join elimination and materialization.
