**Changes**: Materialized all filtered dimension subsets into separate CTEs and created a single filtered fact CTE for store_sales. Restructured the self-join to use the pre-filtered store_sales data only once, then joined against the dimension CTEs for the pair computation.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by reducing repeated filtering and enabling better cardinality estimates through small dimension hash tables.
