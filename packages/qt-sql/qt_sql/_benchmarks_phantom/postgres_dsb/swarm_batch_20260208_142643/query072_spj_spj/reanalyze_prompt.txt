## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown to dimension tables before joining, using CTEs or derived tables to isolate selective filters on date_dim, item, and demographics early in the execution plan.

```sql
WITH filtered_date_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),

    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.91x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables (date, item, demographics) into materialized CTEs with explicit joins, then join with the fact tables (catalog_sales, inventory) using the filtered dimension keys.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
),
filtered_cd AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'M'
      AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11

    WHERE d_year = 1998
),

    SELECT d2.d_date_sk, d2.d_week_seq

  MIN(d1.d_week_seq),

### Worker 3: aggressive_materialized_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize pre-filtered subsets of BOTH dimension AND fact tables into separate CTEs before performing joins, and consider decomposing the date_dim self-join pattern for better optimization.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_marital_status = 'M'
      AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11
),

    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.17x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the query structure by eliminating redundant scans through fact table decomposition, converting implicit correlations to explicit joins, and materializing intermediate result sets to break complex join dependencies.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
