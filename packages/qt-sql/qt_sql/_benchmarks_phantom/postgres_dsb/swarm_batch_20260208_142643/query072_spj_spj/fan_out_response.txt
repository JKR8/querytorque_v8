WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown to dimension tables before joining, using CTEs or derived tables to isolate selective filters on date_dim, item, and demographics early in the execution plan.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables (date, item, demographics) into materialized CTEs with explicit joins, then join with the fact tables (catalog_sales, inventory) using the filtered dimension keys.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_materialized_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered subsets of BOTH dimension AND fact tables into separate CTEs before performing joins, and consider decomposing the date_dim self-join pattern for better optimization.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform the query structure by eliminating redundant scans through fact table decomposition, converting implicit correlations to explicit joins, and materializing intermediate result sets to break complex join dependencies.
