**Changes**: Created separate filtered CTEs for each dimension table (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) to push down filters early, reduce join cardinality, and convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: 2.2-2.5x due to early reduction of dimension tables before the large fact table join, allowing more efficient index usage on web_sales while preserving EXISTS/NOT EXISTS semantics.
