You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins, push down selective filters early, and decorrelate subqueries to reduce row counts before aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2002-10-01' AND CAST('2002-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY'
),

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs, then restructure joins to improve predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate result size.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2002-10-01' AND CAST('2002-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY'

- **Status**: pass (0.14x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into CTEs, then restructure the self-join and anti-join using precomputed aggregates to minimize repeated scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2002-10-01' AND CAST('2002-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY'

### Worker 4: novel_subquery_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column reference "ws_order_number" is ambiguous
LINE 40:     COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number)

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Transform EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries using decorrelation techniques, decompose the self-join into a grouped CTE, and leverage explicit joins with isolated date filtering.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
