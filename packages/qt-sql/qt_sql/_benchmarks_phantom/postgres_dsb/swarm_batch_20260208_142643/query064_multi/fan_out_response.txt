WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better cardinality estimates, and pre-filter dimension tables before the main join.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation_date_dimension
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim filters into dedicated CTEs, pre-filter all dimension tables with explicit JOINs, and consider materializing filtered fact subsets.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then restructure the main self-join to compute aggregations once before the final self-join.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_self_join_elimination_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Eliminate the costly self-join by computing year-over-year aggregates in a single pass using conditional aggregation (CASE statements) within the cross_sales CTE.
