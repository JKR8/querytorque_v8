## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.57x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better cardinality estimates, and pre-filter dimension tables before the main join.

```sql
WITH 
-- Pre-filter dimension tables with selective conditions
filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year IN (1998, 1999)  -- Only years needed by main query

    SELECT p_promo_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_isolation_date_dimension
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column "c_first_sales_date_sk" does not exist
LINE 72:     ON c_first_sales_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
                ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date_dim filters into dedicated CTEs, pre-filter all dimension tables with explicit JOINs, and consider materializing filtered fact subsets.

```sql
WITH cs_ui AS (
  SELECT
    cs.cs_item_sk,
    SUM(cs.cs_ext_list_price) AS sale,

- **Status**: error (0.00x)

LINE 100:   WHERE cd1.cd_marital_status <> cd2.cd_marital_status
                  ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then restructure the main self-join to compute aggregations once before the final self-join.

```sql
WITH cs_ui AS (
  SELECT
    cs_item_sk,
    SUM(cs_ext_list_price) AS sale,
    SUM(cr_refunded_cash + cr_reversed_charge + cr_store_credit) AS refund

LINE 42:     ON c_first_sales_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
                ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Eliminate the costly self-join by computing year-over-year aggregates in a single pass using conditional aggregation (CASE statements) within the cross_sales CTE.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
