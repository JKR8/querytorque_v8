Changes: Created separate CTEs for filtered date and customer dimensions, then separate CTEs for each sales channel with early joins to pre-filtered dimensions. This reduces repetitive filtering and allows each channel's results to be computed independently before intersection.
Expected speedup: 2.2x - 3.0x by eliminating redundant date_dim and customer table scans across all three branches.
