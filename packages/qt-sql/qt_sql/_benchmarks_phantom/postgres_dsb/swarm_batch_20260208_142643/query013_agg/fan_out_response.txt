WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on safe improvements: push filters early, convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs, isolate selective date dimension.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_CTE_dimension_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize filtered dimension subsets (date, demographics, address) into CTEs before joining with fact table, maintaining explicit joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize ALL dimension tables AND fact table subsets in separate CTEs, then join, optimizing for multi-branch filter patterns.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_OR_to_UNION_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform complex OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, deduplicate fact table scans, and apply dimension prefetch per branch.
