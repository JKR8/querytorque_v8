## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.85x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, incremental optimizations: push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and isolate selective dimension filters before joining to improve predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT
        wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
        ca_state AS ctr_state,
        wr_reason_sk AS ctr_reason_sk,

    FROM web_returns
    JOIN date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN item ON wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE d_year = 1998

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.76x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure CTEs to isolate date and dimension filtering first, then materialize intermediate results to break down the complex self-join and reduce repeated computation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 17 AND 26

        SUM(wr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM web_returns
    INNER JOIN filtered_date ON wr_returned_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN customer_address ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_item ON wr_item_sk = filtered_item.i_item_sk

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Aggressively pre‑filter and materialize all dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then compute the aggregation once and rewrite the correlated subquery as a second CTE to eliminate duplicate scans.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Explore structural transformations: decompose the self‑join by computing the average aggregation in a separate CTE, then join back; also consider converting the IN list to a UNION or transforming the state filter with a window function.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
