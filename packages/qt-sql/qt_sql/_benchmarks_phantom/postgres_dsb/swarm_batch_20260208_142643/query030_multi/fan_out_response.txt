WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply safe, incremental optimizations: push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and isolate selective dimension filters before joining to improve predicate pushdown.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Restructure CTEs to isolate date and dimension filtering first, then materialize intermediate results to break down the complex self-join and reduce repeated computation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Aggressively pre‑filter and materialize all dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then compute the aggregation once and rewrite the correlated subquery as a second CTE to eliminate duplicate scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Explore structural transformations: decompose the self‑join by computing the average aggregation in a separate CTE, then join back; also consider converting the IN list to a UNION or transforming the state filter with a window function.
