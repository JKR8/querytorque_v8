You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push selective filters (date, demographics, location) as early as possible into joins using explicit join syntax, reduce intermediate row counts through predicate pushdown before aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')
       OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
),
filtered_household_demographics AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -7
)
SELECT
    cc_call_center_id AS Call_Center,

JOIN call_center ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk

```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column "cd_marital_status" does not exist
LINE 43:     cd_marital_status,
             ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate highly selective dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics) into CTEs with pre-applied filters before joining to the fact table, using explicit JOINs for clarity.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')
       OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
),
filtered_household_demographics AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'

filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk

)

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension subsets and pre-filtered fact rows into separate CTEs, then perform joins on reduced datasets to minimize hash table sizes and memory pressure.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown')
       OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
),
filtered_household_demographics AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'

### Worker 4: novel_or_to_union_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.27x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the OR condition on demographics into a UNION ALL of two separate subqueries, potentially enabling better filter pushdown and index usage for each demographic pattern.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 1

### Worker 5: refined_snipe

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**:

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
