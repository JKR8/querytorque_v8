**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and created three pre-filtered dimension CTEs (date_dim, item, customer_address) to reduce early join cardinality before joining with large fact tables.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x due to early reduction of dimension rows and explicit join syntax enabling better PostgreSQL join ordering.
