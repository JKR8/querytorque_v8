WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply safe filter pushdowns, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter selective dimension tables to reduce early join cardinality.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into CTEs, use explicit joins, and consider materializing selective dimension subsets before joining with large fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into CTEs, restructure the two fact-table pattern (store_sales/web_sales) as separate pre-aggregations, then combine.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_conditional_join_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform the dual fact-table join pattern using conditional aggregation in a single scan, or restructure the date range join (d2 between d1 and d1+30) using a lateral join or window function.
