  "what_worked": "Applied date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join: ** Pre-filtered all dimension tables (item, customer_address, household_demographics, date_dim) and fact tables (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales) into materialized CTEs using their selective WHERE conditions before performing joins. This reduces large table scans by applying filters early in isolated CTEs.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x based on similar patterns in reference examples, particularly from pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x) and pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)",
  "why_it_worked": "Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering multiple dimension tables in parallel reduces join fan-out; Pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation reduces join input",
