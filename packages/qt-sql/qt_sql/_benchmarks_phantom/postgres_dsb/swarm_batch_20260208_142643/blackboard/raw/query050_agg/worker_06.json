Created `sales_returns_joined` CTE that joins store_sales with filtered returns on the most selective key (ticket_number) first, then computes date difference mathematically using integer keys.\n3. Used EXISTS with date_dim to enforce the 120-day window without joining date_dim again, converting the date range condition to integer key arithmetic.\n4",
