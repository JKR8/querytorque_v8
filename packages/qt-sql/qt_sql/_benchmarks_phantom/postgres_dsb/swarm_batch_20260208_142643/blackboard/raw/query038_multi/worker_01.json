The CTE-based pre-filtering (filtered_date, filtered_customer) creates optimization fences preventing predicate pushdown into the large fact tables. This forces materialization of intermediate results that don't benefit from fact table indexes. The INTERSECT operations require three separate passes over customer/date combinations with expensive deduplication, while all attempts preserved ",
