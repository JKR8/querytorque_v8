Worker 1 failed due to incorrect join condition (integer to character). Worker 2-5 achieved only modest speedups (1.36x-1.58x) because they only applied standard dimension pre-filtering but didn't address the core optimization challenges: 1) The date range join (d2.d_date between d1.d_date and d1.d_date + 30 days) requires scann",
