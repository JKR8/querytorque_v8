Specifically:\n1. **CTE Materialization Overhead**: Workers 3-5 created multiple CTEs that PostgreSQL materializes (acts as optimization fences), preventing filter pushdown and join reordering. This forced sequential execution of large intermediate results.\n2. **Inefficient Self-Join Strategy**: The core bottleneck is the `store_sales` self-join on `ss_ticket_number`. Worker",
