  "why_it_failed": "The attempts fell short because they focused on syntactic rewrites (CTEs, explicit joins) without addressing the fundamental performance bottlenecks: (1) Three separate correlated subqueries (EXISTS/NOT EXISTS) force repeated scanning of massive fact tables (store_sales, web_sales, catalog_sales) for each qualifying customer, creating O(n\u00b2) behavior. (2) Workers 1-3 kept correlated subqueries or inefficient anti-join patterns. Worker 4's anti-join approach (1.14x) was better but still performed ",
