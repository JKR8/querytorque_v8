PostgreSQL's optimizer often inlines CTEs, making them optimization fences that prevent join reordering and predicate pushdown. The real bottleneck is the massive Cartesian product between date_dim self-join and fact tables before applying the 120-day range filter, causing explosive intermediate results.
