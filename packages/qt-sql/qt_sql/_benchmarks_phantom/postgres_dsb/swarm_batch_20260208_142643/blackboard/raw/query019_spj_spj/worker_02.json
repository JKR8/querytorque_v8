  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short due to PostgreSQL's CTE optimization fence behavior. Workers 1-5 used non-materialized CTEs (default behavior in versions prior to 12), causing the planner to compute each CTE independently without cross-CTE join optimization or predicate pushdown. This prevented join order flexibility and forced nested-loop-like execution patterns. Worker 4's EXISTS approach was catastrophic (0.09x) because it created correlated subqueries that executed per fact row. The common CTE-based",
