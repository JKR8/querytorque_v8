This happened because workers created CTEs for filtered dimension tables (like customer_address) but only selected a subset of columns (e.g., just `ca_address_sk`), then referenced additional columns (like `ca_state`) from these CTEs in the main query's WHERE clause. Attempts 1, 2, and 5 all made this same structural mistake by referencing columns from CTEs that weren't",
