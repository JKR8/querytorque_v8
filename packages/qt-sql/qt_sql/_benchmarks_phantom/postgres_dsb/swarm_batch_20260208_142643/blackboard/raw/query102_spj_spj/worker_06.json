  "why_it_failed": "All previous attempts fell short because they focused on dimension table pre-filtering (date_dim, item, customer_address) but missed the critical bottleneck: the expensive cross-join pattern between store_sales and web_sales via the date range condition `d2.d_date between d1.d_date and (d1.d_date + interval '30 day')`. This creates an implicit Cartesian product that scales poorly. Worker 1-2 and 4-5 achieved minor gains (1.16-1.20x) by reducing dimension cardinality, but the fundamental O(N\u00b2) da",
