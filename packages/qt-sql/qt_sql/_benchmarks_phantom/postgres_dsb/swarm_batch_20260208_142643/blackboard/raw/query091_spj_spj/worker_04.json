This reduces redundant scans and allows early filtering.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~2-3x due to elimination of the multi-way join explosion and early reduction of customer rows via EXISTS semi-joins.",
  "why_it_failed": "All attempts relied on CTE-based early filtering but failed due to PostgreSQL's CTE optimization fence behavior. Worker 1-2 and 5 showed marginal gains (1.04-1.08x) because CTEs prevent predicate pushdown and join reordering across CTE boundaries, forcing materialization of intermediate results. Worker 3-4 performed worse (0.45-0.58x) due to excessive materialization and EXISTS subqueries that created correlated execution patterns. The core issue: CTEs break the optimizer's ability to leverage s",
