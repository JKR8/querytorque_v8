WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on pushing filters early into CTEs, converting implicit joins to explicit JOINs with date dimension pre-filtering, and applying safe predicate pushdown without major restructuring.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into materialized CTEs, restructure the main query to use explicit JOINs with pre-filtered CTEs, and decorrelate subqueries for better planning.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter ALL dimension tables and fact tables into separate materialized CTEs, then join. Decompose the self-join pattern in the final query to compute aggregations once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_intersect_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform the INTERSECT operations to EXISTS or IN subqueries, restructure the cross_items CTE to reduce set operations, and apply structural transforms to the year comparison logic.
