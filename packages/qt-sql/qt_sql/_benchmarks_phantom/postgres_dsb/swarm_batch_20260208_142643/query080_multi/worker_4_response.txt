**Changes**: Unified three separate CTEs into a single fact-union CTE with channel tagging, then applied dimension joins once via pre-filtered dimension CTEs. Used CASE expressions for channel-specific formatting in the final aggregation instead of separate branches. This reduces redundant dimension table scans and allows PostgreSQL to optimize the single large UNION ALL.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x due to eliminating repeated dimension table filtering and reducing the number of separate aggregation operations from three to one.
