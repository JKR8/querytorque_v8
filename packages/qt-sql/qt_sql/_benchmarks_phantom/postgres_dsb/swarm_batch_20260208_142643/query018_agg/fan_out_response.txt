WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown and early filtering to reduce join sizes, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and selectively pre-filter dimension tables before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation_explicit_joins
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective dimension filters (date, item, customer) into explicit CTEs, convert all comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and materialize only necessary filtered dimension subsets.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialized_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize ALL dimension tables AND the fact table in separate CTEs, then join the pre-aggregated results. Use CTE materialization to force optimal join order.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform_rollup_optimization
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Decompose the ROLLUP aggregation by computing base aggregates once in a CTE, then derive rollup levels separately. Transform implicit joins to explicit joins with early filtering to enable better plan choices.
