WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown to filter date_dim and store tables early, then use explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control and join order.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim filters into CTEs, pre-filter store and fact tables, then join materialized subsets to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure joins to eliminate redundant scans and leverage efficient hash joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform_window
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Decompose the self-join pattern using window functions or derived tables, convert the date range condition to a join filter, and pre-fetch dimension keys.
