WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and prefetch selective dimension tables to reduce base fact table volumes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Restructure CTEs for better plan control: isolate date ranges into explicit CTEs, materialize filtered dimension subsets, and push correlated subquery filters into main CTE definitions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Precompute and materialize all filtered dimension/fact subsets before main query execution, and eliminate duplicate fact table scans by reusing pre-aggregated CTEs across union branches.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform query structure radically: convert OR-implied UNION branches to explicit disjoint UNION ALL, replace IN-subqueries with EXISTS semi-joins, and flatten nested aggregations.
