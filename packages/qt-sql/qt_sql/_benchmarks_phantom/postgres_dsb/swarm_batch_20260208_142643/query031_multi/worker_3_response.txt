**Changes**: Pre-filtered all dimension tables into materialized CTEs, then restructured the self-join pattern to compute quarterly aggregates once per channel and pivot them using conditional aggregation, eliminating the 6-way self-join entirely.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x due to reduced intermediate result sizes and elimination of repetitive self-joins.
