- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters to earliest possible point, use explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining with fact tables.

- **Status**: pass (0.73x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure CTEs to pre-filter dimensions and facts, use MATERIALIZED CTEs where beneficial, and isolate selective date filters.

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column d.d_qoy does not exist
LINE 21:     d.d_qoy,
             ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension and fact tables into materialized CTEs, then restructure the self-join pattern to compute aggregations once.

WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1998

- **Status**: pass (0.67x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
