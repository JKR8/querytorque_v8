**Changes**: Replaced the 6-way self-join with pivot CTEs that aggregate quarterly sales into columns, allowing a single join between store and web results. Added pre-filtering CTEs for dimensions and pushed year/quarter filters early.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by eliminating repeated scans of the same CTEs and reducing join complexity from O(n³) to O(n).
