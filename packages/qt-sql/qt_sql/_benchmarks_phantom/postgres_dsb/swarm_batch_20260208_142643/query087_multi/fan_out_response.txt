WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables to reduce join cardinality before set operations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date_dim filtering into a CTE, pre-fetch filtered dimension tables, and restructure with explicit joins to optimize the repeated date range scans across three sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then restructure EXCEPT operations using precomputed sets to eliminate redundant scans and leverage temporary materialization.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_set_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform EXCEPT operations using NOT EXISTS anti-joins or window deduplication, pre-compute base customer set once, and apply channel-specific conditions as correlated filters to avoid triple scanning.
