## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W4 achieved 1.52x via novel_set_transform. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query087_multi_snipe

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM (
  (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      c_last_name,
      c_first_name,
      d_date
    FROM store_sales, date_dim, customer
    WHERE
      store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      AND store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Count customer/date combinations that appear in store sales but not in catalog or web sales over the same 12-month window (set-difference pattern).
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~3.9M rows
**Outputs**: [COUNT(*)]
**Dependencies**: web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales
**Joins**: web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk | web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
**Filters**: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11 | ws_list_price BETWEEN 217 AND 246 | c_birth_year BETWEEN 1943 AND 1949 | ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 44
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[Subquery Scan], SEQ_SCAN[Subquery Scan], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[customer]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM (
  (
    SELECT DISTINCT
      c_last_name,
      c_first_name,
      d_date
    FROM store_sales, date_dim, customer
    WHERE
      store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      AND store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
      AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
      AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 217 AND 246
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1943 AND 1949
      AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 44
  )
  EXCEPT
  (
    SELECT DISTINCT
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[date_filter]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
```
[store_sales_revenue]:
```sql
SELECT ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue FROM store_sales JOIN date_filter ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.38 AND 0.48 GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
```
[store_avg_revenue]:
```sql
SELECT ss_store_sk, AVG(revenue) AS ave FROM store_sales_revenue GROUP BY ss_store_sk
```
[filtered_store]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('TN', 'TX', 'VA')
```
[filtered_item]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 AND 36
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, i_item_desc, sc.revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM store_avg_revenue AS sb JOIN store_sales_revenue AS sc ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk JOIN filtered_store AS s ON sc.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_item AS i ON sc.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk WHERE sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave ORDER BY s_store_name, i_item_desc LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**

Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `COUNT(*)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
