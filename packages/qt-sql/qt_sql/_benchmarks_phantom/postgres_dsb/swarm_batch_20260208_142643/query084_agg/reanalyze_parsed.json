  "failure_analysis": "All attempts failed to reach 2.0x because they focused on dimension-table filtering without addressing the core bottleneck: the large store_returns fact table join. Worker 4's lateral approach (1.64x) came closest by attempting early fact table reduction but still performed full joins. Key mechanisms causing the shortfall: 1) All strategies join store_returns last, after expensive dimension joins, creating massive intermediate results; 2) No attempt to push the LIMIT 100 and ORDER BY into the fact table join to reduce cardinality early; 3) Repeated materialization of filtered dimensions without considering correlated filtering between store_returns and customer_demographics; 4) The implicit join order forces store_returns to scan all rows matching the demographic filter rather than seeking top customers directly.",
  "unexplored": "1. **Early fact-table limitation**: Use store_returns as the driving table with ORDER BY c_customer_id pushed down via join conditions.\n2. **Correlated filtering**: Filter store_returns by cd_demo_sk values that satisfy address/income conditions in a single pass.\n3. **Row-limiting before full joins**: Apply LIMIT 100 at the customer level before joining to all dimensions.\n4. **Partial aggregation**: Pre-aggregate store_returns by cd_demo_sk and customer keys to reduce rows.\n5. **Inverse join order**: Start from a limited set of customers who have store_returns, then verify dimension filters.",
  "refined_strategy": "Start from store_returns, join to customer_demographics, then to customer with early filtering on address and income conditions via EXISTS subqueries. Apply ORDER BY and LIMIT at the customer level before expensive string concatenation and full dimension materialization. Use a correlated subquery to check address/income conditions without full joins to all dimension tables.",

  "hint": "Drive from store_returns with ORDER BY c_customer_id, filter customers via EXISTS against pre-filtered address and income_band dimensions, and apply LIMIT early to minimize dimension table joins."
