You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.82x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push selective filters (date_dim, state/country) into CTEs early, then use explicit joins to reduce the base fact table scan.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_state
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_country = 'United States'
      AND ca_state IN ('IA', 'MO', 'TX', 'GA', 'LA', 'SD', 'TN', 'TX', 'VA')
),

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date_dim and key dimension filters into CTEs, then restructure joins to improve predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate row counts.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_cd_hd AS (
    SELECT

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact subsets into separate CTEs, then join aggressively to minimize re-computation of OR conditions.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status

- **Status**: pass (0.20x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
