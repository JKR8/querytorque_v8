WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push selective filters (date_dim, state/country) into CTEs early, then use explicit joins to reduce the base fact table scan.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date_dim and key dimension filters into CTEs, then restructure joins to improve predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate row counts.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact subsets into separate CTEs, then join aggressively to minimize re-computation of OR conditions.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform the two OR clusters (demographic + price, address + profit) into separate UNION ALL branches to allow per-branch optimization and index usage.
