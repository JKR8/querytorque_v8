WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter dimension tables before the main aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate date filtering into a CTE, then materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact tables before the aggregation, finally apply decorrelation techniques.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_selfjoin
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into materialized CTEs, then compute the base aggregation once and derive both sides of the self-join from it.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_union_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the self-join by computing a single CTE with all months, then use conditional aggregation or UNION-based approaches to compare consecutive months, while pushing filters early.
