WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Push filters into derived tables early and convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs to give the optimizer better selectivity estimates and join order control.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into separate CTEs, then join with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension and fact tables into materialized CTEs, then perform joins in a controlled order to minimize large table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Break the self-join pattern by computing aggregations once in CTEs, then derive metrics, and use explicit join ordering to avoid duplicate work.
