**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and created separate CTEs for each dimension table with their respective filters pushed down early. This allows PostgreSQL to build small hash tables from selective dimension filters before joining with the large fact table.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x, based on similar patterns in the reference examples where early filter pushdown and explicit joins improved performance significantly.
