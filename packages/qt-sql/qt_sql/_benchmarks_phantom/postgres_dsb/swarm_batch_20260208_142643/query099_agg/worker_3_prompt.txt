## Optimization Strategy: aggressive_multi_cte_prefiltering

**Your approach**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then perform a single join pass with the aggregated results to minimize repeated scans.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Bucket catalog shipment latency over a 24-month sequence by warehouse, ship mode, and call center under price/class/offset filters.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~13k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,, sm_type, cc_name, 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, >120 days] — ordered by SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20) ASC, sm_type ASC, cc_name ASC
**Dependencies**: catalog_sales, warehouse (join), ship_mode (join), call_center (join), date_dim (join)
**Joins**: cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk | cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk | cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk | cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
**Filters**: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1193 + 23 | cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 | sm_type = 'REGULAR' | cc_class = 'small' | w_gmt_offset = -5
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[call_center], SEQ_SCAN[warehouse], SEQ_SCAN[ship_mode], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20),
  sm_type,
  cc_name,
  SUM(CASE WHEN (
    cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30
  ) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days",
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30
      )
      AND (
        cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60
      )
      THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS "31-60 days",
  SUM(

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  i_item_desc
      ,w_warehouse_name
      ,d1.d_week_seq
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) no_promo
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) promo
      ,count(*) total_cnt
from catalog_sales
join inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)
join warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)
join item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
join customer_demographics on (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)
join household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)
join date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)
left outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)
left outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
where d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day'
  and hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
  and d1.d_year = 1998
  and cd_marital_status = 'M'
  and cd_dep_count between 9 and 11
  and i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
group by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq
order by total_cnt desc, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq

```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 3. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk

       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')

```

**AFTER (fast):**

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,`
  2. `sm_type`
  3. `cc_name`
  4. `30 days`
  5. `31-60 days`
  6. `61-90 days`
  7. `91-120 days`
  8. `>120 days`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
