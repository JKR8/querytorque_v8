WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply safe, selective filters early in the query plan by converting implicit joins to explicit syntax and pushing date/dimension constraints down before the main aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective date_range and dimension filters into CTEs, then join with the fact table using explicit JOIN syntax to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefiltering
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then perform a single join pass with the aggregated results to minimize repeated scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_conditional_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Restructure the conditional aggregation using a decomposed approach—potentially splitting the fact table scan by date ranges or using UNION techniques to optimize the CASE evaluations.
