**Changes**: Decomposed the multi-way join into sequenced CTEs, pushing down the most selective filters (`ca_city` and `income_band` bounds) early into separate materialized CTEs. This reduces the intermediate join sizes before combining with the larger tables.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x from reduced intermediate result sizes and better join order optimization.
