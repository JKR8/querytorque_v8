WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_explicit_join_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax while pushing selective filters (city/income) early in the plan. Pre-filter dimension tables before joining to reduce cardinality.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective dimension filters (customer_address, income_band) into CTEs, then join with explicit syntax. Maintain original join order but optimize dimension access patterns.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_materialized_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension tables and store_returns into CTEs with aggressive filtering, then join the precomputed sets. Use explicit joins with potential materialization hints.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_join_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Break the multi-way join into sequenced subqueries using EXISTS or derived tables. Potentially compute aggregates in stages and reconstruct the final result through join decomposition.
