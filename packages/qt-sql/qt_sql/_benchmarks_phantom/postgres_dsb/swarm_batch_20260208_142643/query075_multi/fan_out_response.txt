WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter_optimization
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Apply conservative optimizations by pushing filters earlier, converting implicit joins to explicit joins, and pre-filtering dimension tables to reduce join sizes while maintaining the original query structure.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective dimension filters (date, item) into materialized CTEs, then restructure the main UNION query with explicit joins to improve join ordering and reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Use aggressive prefetching by creating multiple materialized CTEs for filtered dimension and fact data, then restructure the self-join pattern to compute aggregates once instead of scanning large fact tables multiple times.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply novel structural transformations such as decomposing the self-join into a single aggregation CTE with year grouping, then deriving prev/curr years via conditional aggregation or window functions to eliminate redundant scans and optimize ratio calculations.
