**Changes**: Created separate CTEs for each filtered dimension table (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address), a CTE for filtered customers (joining the three demographic CTEs via EXISTS), and a CTE for filtered catalog_returns. This aggressively materializes small filtered subsets before the final join, reducing the intermediate join sizes dramatically.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.5x based on similar star-join patterns in the reference examples.
