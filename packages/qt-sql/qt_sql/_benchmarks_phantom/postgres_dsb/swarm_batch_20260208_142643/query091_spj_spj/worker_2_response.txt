```

Changes: Isolated all four selective dimension filters into separate CTEs (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address), pre-joined them with customer in a CTE, then joined the reduced results with the fact table (catalog_returns) and call_center. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

Expected speedup: 2.5-3.5x due to early reduction of join cardinality and better hash join planning with small dimension hash tables.
