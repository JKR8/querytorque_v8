WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on improving filter performance by pushing conditions earlier, decorrelating subqueries, and converting implicit joins to explicit joins to give the optimizer better selectivity estimates.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate the complex date filter chain into a reusable CTE, pre-filter all dimension tables (date_dim, item) with materialized CTEs, and restructure joins to reduce repeated computation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_fusion
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize dimension and fact tables into a single base CTE, then compute all three return aggregations (store, catalog, web) in one scan using conditional aggregation, eliminating the three separate CTEs.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_union_intersect_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform the three separate CTEs into a UNION ALL of base returns, then use a single aggregation with FILTER clauses. Also explore replacing the multi-level date subquery with a window-based lookup or a temporal JOIN.
