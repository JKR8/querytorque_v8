Changes: Restructured query using aggressive_multi_cte_materialization strategy - created separate materialized CTEs for each filtered dimension table and the filtered fact subset, then joined them with explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: ~2-3x by reducing join search space through early materialization of highly selective dimension filters and explicit join ordering.
