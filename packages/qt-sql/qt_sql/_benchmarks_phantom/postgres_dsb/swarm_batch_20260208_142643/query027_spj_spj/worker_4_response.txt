Changes: Applied structural decomposition by creating separate CTEs for each dimension table with their filters applied early, then joined them to the fact table. This reduces the join cardinality by filtering dimensions before the main join.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2.0x (reduces join cardinality by filtering small dimension tables first)
