WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply basic predicate pushdown, convert implicit to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining—safe optimizations with minimal risk.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Use CTEs to isolate selective date and dimension filters first, then join with fact table; materialize CTEs only if beneficial.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables AND fact table into materialized CTEs, then join—aggressive restructuring to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Decompose the query using CTEs for each aggregate path or apply decorrelation techniques; consider rewriting MIN() operations via window functions or separate subqueries.
