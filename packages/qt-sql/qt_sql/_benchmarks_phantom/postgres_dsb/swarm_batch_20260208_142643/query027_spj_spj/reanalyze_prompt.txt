You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.65x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply basic predicate pushdown, convert implicit to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining—safe optimizations with minimal risk.

```sql
WITH filtered_date_dim AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state = 'VA'
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
)
SELECT
  MIN(i_item_id),
  MIN(s_state),
  MIN(ss_quantity),
  MIN(ss_list_price),
  MIN(ss_coupon_amt),
  MIN(ss_sales_price),
  MIN(ss_item_sk),
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.80x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Use CTEs to isolate selective date and dimension filters first, then join with fact table; materialize CTEs only if beneficial.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state = 'VA'
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'
)
SELECT
    MIN(i_item_id),
    MIN(s_state),
    MIN(ss_quantity),
    MIN(ss_list_price),
    MIN(ss_coupon_amt),

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables AND fact table into materialized CTEs, then join—aggressive restructuring to minimize intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'

### Worker 4: novel_structural_decomposition
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Decompose the query using CTEs for each aggregate path or apply decorrelation techniques; consider rewriting MIN() operations via window functions or separate subqueries.

```sql
WITH 
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state = 'VA'
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),

    AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
