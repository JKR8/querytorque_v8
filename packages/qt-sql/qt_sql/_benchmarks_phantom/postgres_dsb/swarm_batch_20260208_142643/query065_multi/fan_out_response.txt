WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_explicit_join_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax, push filters down early, and pre-filter dimension tables using CTEs to reduce row counts before expensive joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into separate CTEs, then join in a star pattern. Use explicit JOINs for better cardinality estimation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered fact and dimension subsets into CTEs, then restructure the self-join to avoid redundant scans. Prefetch dimensions to minimize repeated lookups.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Eliminate the correlated subquery pattern by computing aggregates once, then apply set operations or exists logic. Use materialization to flatten the query graph.
