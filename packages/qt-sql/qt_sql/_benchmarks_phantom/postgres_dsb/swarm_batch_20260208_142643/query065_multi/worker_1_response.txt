**Changes**: Converted comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax, created separate CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, store, item), and established a single filtered fact table CTE to compute both revenue aggregates from a single scan. This pushes filters down early and reduces row counts before expensive joins.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x through reduced fact table scans, smaller hash tables, and better join order optimization.
