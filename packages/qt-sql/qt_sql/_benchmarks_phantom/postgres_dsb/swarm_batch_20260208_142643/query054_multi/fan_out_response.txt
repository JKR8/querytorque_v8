WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_decorrelate
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on safely pushing filters into CTEs, converting implicit joins to explicit joins, and decorrelating date subqueries by precomputing date ranges.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective dimension filters (date, item) into separate CTEs, materialize them to break up large joins, and apply early aggregation where possible.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize all dimension tables first, then restructure the query to process each sales channel separately before unioning to avoid repeated dimension joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Transform the query by decomposing the self-join pattern in the revenue CTE, using UNION to separate state conditions, and converting range filters to interval joins.
