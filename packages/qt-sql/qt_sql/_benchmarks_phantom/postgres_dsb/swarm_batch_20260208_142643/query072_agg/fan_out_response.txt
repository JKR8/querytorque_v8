WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters early into CTEs, pre-filtering dimension tables, and reducing join cardinality before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into explicit CTEs, then join with the fact table to minimize intermediate data movement.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize ALL dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure joins to eliminate duplicate scans and leverage prefetching.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Break complex join patterns via decomposition (fact table self-joins), decorrelate filters, and use materialized pre-filtering for radical plan changes.
