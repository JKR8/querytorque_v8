WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_joins
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on pushing date/dimension filters early and converting implicit comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_isolation_cte
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Isolate each date_dim instance into separate CTEs with filters, then join with explicit syntax to reduce repeated scans and enable better partition pruning.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimensions and fact table subsets in separate CTEs, then restructure the query to compute aggregations in stages, avoiding multiple large-table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_fact_aggregation_fusion
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Fuse the three fact-table aggregations by pre-aggregating each fact channel separately in CTEs before joining, eliminating redundant joins and reducing intermediate row counts.
