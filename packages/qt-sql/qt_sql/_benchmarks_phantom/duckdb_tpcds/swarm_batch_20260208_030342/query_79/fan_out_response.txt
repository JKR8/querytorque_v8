WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into subqueries, filter dimension tables early to reduce join size, and materialize repeated computations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, store, household_demographics) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table to enable predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate results.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with multiple CTEs: pre-filter dimensions, pre-join with fact table in stages, and consolidate aggregations into a single pass to minimize full table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Apply structural transformations: split OR conditions into UNION ALL, convert INTERSECT patterns to EXISTS for better join planning, and decorrelate subqueries to enable independent optimization.
