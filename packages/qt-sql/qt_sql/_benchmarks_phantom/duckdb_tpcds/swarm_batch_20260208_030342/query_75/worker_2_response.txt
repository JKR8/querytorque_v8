Changes: Created filtered CTEs for `item` (with `i_category = 'Home'`) and `date_dim` (with `d_year IN (1998, 1999)`), then reused them across all three sales channel joins. This isolates dimension filtering, enables predicate pushdown, and reduces redundant scans. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2.0x due to reduced dimension scanning and better predicate pushdown across union branches.
