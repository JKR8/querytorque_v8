WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filtering
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push date filters into subqueries early, pre-filter dimension tables before joins, and materialize common date/customer patterns to avoid repeated computation with minimal structural change.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and customer dimension filters into dedicated CTEs to enable predicate pushdown across all sales channels, then join each fact table separately with pre-filtered dimensions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_channel_consolidation
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Consolidate three sales-channel subqueries into a single CTE using conditional aggregation or UNION ALL, pre-join filtered dimensions with facts, and prefetch multiple dimension combinations to reduce join overhead.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_set_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform EXCEPT operations into NOT EXISTS patterns or UNION ALL with anti-joins, restructure OR-like filters across channels into UNION branches, and decorrelate multiple subqueries into pre-materialized sets.
