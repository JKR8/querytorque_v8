**Changes**: Created CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, household_demographics, customer_demographics) and store_sales (pushing price/profit range filters), then joined them with explicit join syntax while preserving all original OR logic for exact semantic equivalence.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by reducing fact table scan cardinality early and minimizing join sizes through dimension pre-filtering.
