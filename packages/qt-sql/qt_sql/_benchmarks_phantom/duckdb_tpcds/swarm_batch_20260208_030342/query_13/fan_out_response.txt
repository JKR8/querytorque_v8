WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables first, push filters into CTEs, and materialize repeated patterns to reduce join cardinality early and safely.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate all filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join key dimensions with the fact table in staged CTEs, then join remaining dimensions, restructuring the query for sequential filtering.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, decorrelate complex predicates into separate CTEs, and split union branches for optimal index/partition usage.
