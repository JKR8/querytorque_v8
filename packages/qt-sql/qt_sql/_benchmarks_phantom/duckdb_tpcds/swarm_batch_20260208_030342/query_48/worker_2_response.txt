**Changes**: Isolated all three dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, customer_address) into separate filtered CTEs before joining with store_sales, enabling predicate pushdown and creating small hash tables for joins.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x due to reduced dimension scans and better join optimization.
