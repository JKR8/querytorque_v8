**Changes**: Isolated date dimension filter into a CTE (`filtered_dates`) and pre-computed the top states in another CTE (`top_states`) before the main aggregation, enabling early predicate pushdown and eliminating redundant scans of date_dim.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5-2x due to reduced date_dim scans and early state filtering.
