```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into joins early, isolating dimension table filters first, and using CTEs for clarity without aggressive restructuring.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, union_cte_split
HINT: Isolate both date dimension filters (d1, d2) into separate CTEs with predicate pushdown, then restructure dimension joins to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Restructure with multiple prefetch CTEs that pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts before the final aggregation, optimizing for DuckDB's join ordering.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Experiment with radical restructuring: combine all conditional sums into a single-pass aggregation, transform CASE logic to UNION branches, and explore decorrelation patterns.
