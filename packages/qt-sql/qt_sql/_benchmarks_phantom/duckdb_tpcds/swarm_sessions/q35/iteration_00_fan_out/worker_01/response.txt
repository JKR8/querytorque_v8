**Changes**: Created a shared filtered_dates CTE, pre-computed distinct customer keys for each sales channel, converted implicit joins to explicit syntax, and restructured EXISTS conditions to use pre-filtered CTEs while preserving semi-join semantics.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.8-2.2x due to early filtering of date_dim and reduction of large fact table joins through distinct customer CTEs.
