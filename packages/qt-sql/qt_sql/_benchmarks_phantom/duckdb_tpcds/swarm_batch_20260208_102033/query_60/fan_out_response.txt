WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_materialization
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into CTEs, filter dimensions early, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, address) into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, and consolidate shared dimension logic across sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs, prefetch multiple dimensions simultaneously, and consolidate multiple channel scans into a single aggregation pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure using advanced patterns: convert OR conditions to UNION ALL, rewrite subqueries as EXISTS, and decorrelate dependent subqueries into independent CTEs.
