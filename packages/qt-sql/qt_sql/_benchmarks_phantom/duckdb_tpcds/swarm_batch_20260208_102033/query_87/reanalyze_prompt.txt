You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into subqueries and pre-filter dimension tables before joining to reduce data movement and avoid redundant scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1184 AND 1184 + 11
),
store_customers AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        customer.c_last_name,
        customer.c_first_name,
        filtered_dates.d_date
    FROM store_sales
    INNER JOIN filtered_dates 
        ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN customer 
        ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
),

    SELECT DISTINCT
        customer.c_last_name,
        customer.c_first_name,

### Worker 2: moderate_date_shared_dimension_cte
- **Status**: pass (0.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date filtering into a CTE, reuse shared dimension filters across channels, and materialize repeated join patterns to minimize recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1184 AND 1184 + 11
),
customer_data AS (
  SELECT c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name
  FROM customer
),
store_customers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_data.c_last_name,
    customer_data.c_first_name,
    filtered_dates.d_date
  FROM store_sales

  JOIN customer_data ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer_data.c_customer_sk
),
web_customers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    customer_data.c_last_name,

```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_single_pass
- **Status**: pass (0.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Prefetch filtered fact-dimension joins into CTEs, then consolidate the three sales-channel queries into a single CTE using conditional aggregation to scan fact tables once.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1184 AND 1184 + 11
),

    SELECT DISTINCT
        customer.c_last_name,
        customer.c_first_name,
        filtered_date.d_date
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_date ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
    JOIN customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
),

        customer.c_last_name,
        customer.c_first_name,
        filtered_date.d_date
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN filtered_date ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_set_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.79x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform set operations (EXCEPT) into EXISTS/NOT EXISTS or UNION-based patterns, and decorrelate subqueries to enable more efficient join plans.

```sql
WITH store_set AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        c_last_name,
        c_first_name,
        d_date

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
