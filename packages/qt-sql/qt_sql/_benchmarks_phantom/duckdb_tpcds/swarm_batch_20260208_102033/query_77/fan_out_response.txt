WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push date filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables before joining, and materialize reusable date-range CTEs to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolate
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create isolated CTEs for filtered date and dimension tables (store, web_page), then share them across channel-specific CTEs to reduce redundant joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in each channel CTE, attempt consolidated aggregations per table, and prefetch multiple dimension filters in parallel.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Restructure query using UNION ALL for separate channels, transform potential set operations, and decorrelate multiple subqueries into pre-materialized aggregates.
