WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables and push predicates into CTEs to reduce intermediate data volume before expensive joins and window functions.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter each dimension table (date_dim, item, call_center) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join optimization.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Restructure the query to pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in a single pass, then compute window functions on the reduced dataset, avoiding repeated self-joins.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Transform the OR date filter into UNION ALL branches for better partition pruning, and explore consolidating the self-join logic into a single-pass LAG/LEAD window function.
