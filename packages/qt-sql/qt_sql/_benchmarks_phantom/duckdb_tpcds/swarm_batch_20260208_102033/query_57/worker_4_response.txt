Changes: Transformed the OR date filter into three UNION ALL branches for better partition pruning, replaced the triple self-join with LAG/LEAD window functions in a single pass, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. The boundary row filter (psum/nsum NOT NULL) preserves the original self-join semantics.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from partition pruning and eliminating the costly self-join.
