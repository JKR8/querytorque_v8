You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs early, ensuring predicate pushdown to reduce join sizes, and materializing reusable subresults.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
  SELECT
    i_item_sk,
    i_item_id,
    i_item_desc,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_current_price
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category IN ('Sports', 'Music', 'Shoes')
),
filtered_date AS (

  SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) AS itemrevenue,
  SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss.ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i.i_class) AS revenueratio
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_date d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, item) into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table to improve plan clarity and enable parallel filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) 
                   AND (CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)
),

  SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) * 100 / SUM(SUM(ss_ext_sales_price)) OVER (
    PARTITION BY fi.i_class
  ) AS revenueratio
FROM store_sales ss

### Worker 3: aggressive_join_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins by prefetching filtered dimension-fact combinations, consolidate aggregations into single passes, and defer window computations to minimize intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category IN ('Sports', 'Music', 'Shoes')
), filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) AND (
    CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY
  )

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Apply structural query transformations by splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, converting INTERSECT patterns, and decorrelating complex subqueries for better join planning.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
