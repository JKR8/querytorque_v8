WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables and push predicates into CTEs, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs to reduce scans and enable predicate pushdown across multiple channel queries.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs and consolidate multiple aggregations into a single pass to reduce table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure by converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.
