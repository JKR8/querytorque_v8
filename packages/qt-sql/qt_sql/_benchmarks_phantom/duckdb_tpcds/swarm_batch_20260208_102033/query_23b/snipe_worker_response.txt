Changes: Isolated May 2000 dates into a tiny CTE, converted IN subqueries to EXISTS for semi-join short-circuiting, split the main UNION into two specialized CTEs with early joins to the date CTE, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer freedom.

Expected speedup: 2.0x+ via reduced fact table scans, early date filtering, and semi-join optimization.
