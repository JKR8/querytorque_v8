**Changes:** Decorrelated IN subqueries by converting them to explicit JOINs with pre-computed distinct sets (`frequent_items_set`, `best_customers_set`), and created a reusable `filtered_dates` CTE to avoid duplicate date filtering. Removed implicit comma joins in favor of explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup:** 1.8–2.5x due to decorrelation eliminating per-row subquery execution and enabling better join planning with distinct sets.
