WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply safe predicate pushdown to filter dimension tables first, then join to reduce fact table processing with minimal structural changes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, materialize_cte
HINT: Pre-filter both date and item dimensions into separate CTEs before joining with fact table, materializing filtered dimensions to enable better join planning.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Restructure with multi-stage CTEs—first filter dimensions, then pre-join with fact table in separate CTEs—optimizing for DuckDB's join ordering and parallelism.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore radical query restructuring using UNION ALL splits and EXISTS transformations even where not immediately obvious, testing DuckDB's optimizer boundaries.
