WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early to reduce fact table joins, materialize repeated subquery patterns, and apply predicate pushdown to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling reuse across multiple sales channels and reducing redundant scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, union_cte_split
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure the UNION into specialized branches for better join optimization and partition pruning.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, intersect_to_exists, or_to_union
HINT: Transform correlated subqueries into join-efficient CTEs, convert hypothetical INTERSECT patterns to EXISTS, and explore splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL for index-friendly access.
