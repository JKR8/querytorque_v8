**Changes:** 
1. Extracted shared dimension filters (`may_1998_date` for date_dim and `filtered_items` for item) to avoid redundant scans
2. Split the UNION ALL into separate CTEs (`catalog_customers`, `web_customers`) to push dimension filters deeper
3. Materialized the month range calculation (`month_range`) to replace correlated subqueries
4. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control

**Expected speedup:** ≥2.0x through reduced dimension table scans, decorrelated subqueries, and early filtering of sales data.
