WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (item, date_dim) before joining with catalog_sales, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize the repeated subquery pattern to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs to reduce join cardinality early, especially for date ranges, and share pre-filtered dimensions across main and subquery.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact tables in staged CTEs, then restructure the correlated subquery into a single-pass aggregation to eliminate per-row execution.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_correlation_transform
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Decouple the correlated subquery via GROUP BY CTE and JOIN, transform conditional logic using set operations, and explore EXISTS semantics for alternative execution plans.
