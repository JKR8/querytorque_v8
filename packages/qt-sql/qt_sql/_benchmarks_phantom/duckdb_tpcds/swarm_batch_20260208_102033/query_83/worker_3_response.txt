**Changes**: Created two CTEs: `filtered_weeks` to identify target weeks, and `filtered_dates` to pre-materialize all date keys in those weeks. Each channel CTE now joins directly with these pre-filtered CTEs, eliminating repeated subquery evaluation and enabling better join ordering.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3× from decorrelation of date subqueries, reduced repeated computation, and improved join pipelining.
