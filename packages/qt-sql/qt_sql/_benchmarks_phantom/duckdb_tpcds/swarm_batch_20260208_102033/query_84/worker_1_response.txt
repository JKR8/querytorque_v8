**Changes**: Created CTEs to filter dimension tables (customer_address, income_band, household_demographics) early and cascade those filters to customer before joining with larger tables. This reduces the intermediate join sizes significantly.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x from reducing the customer table early via address and household filters before joining with store_returns.
