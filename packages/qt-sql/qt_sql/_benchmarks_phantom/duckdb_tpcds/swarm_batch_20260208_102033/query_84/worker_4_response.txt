```sql
WITH filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Oakwood'
), filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 5806
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 5806 + 50000
), filtered_household_demographics AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    JOIN filtered_income_band ON hd_income_band_sk = ib_income_band_sk
), eligible_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        c_customer_id,
        c_first_name,
        c_last_name,
        c_current_cdemo_sk
    FROM customer
    JOIN filtered_customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN filtered_household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
)
SELECT
    c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM eligible_customers
JOIN store_returns ON sr_cdemo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

```
Changes: Created filtered CTEs for highly selective dimensions (customer_address by city, income_band by bounds), then joined to customer and store_returns. Removed redundant customer_demographics bridge table by joining store_returns directly on c_current_cdemo_sk.
Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x from early filtering of dimension tables and reduced join complexity.
