Changes: Created early-filter CTEs for dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) and pre-materialized the web_returns join with ws_wh. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x due to reduced intermediate data volume from early dimension filtering and consolidated subquery materialization.
