WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into subqueries, filter dimension tables before joining, and materialize repeated date_dim logic into a CTE.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer) into CTEs to enable reuse across sales channels and reduce redundant scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure the query into a multi‑CTE pipeline that prefilters dimensions, pre‑joins with fact tables, and consolidates the three sales channels into a single aggregation pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_intersect_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the INTERSECT set operation into EXISTS/join logic, explore splitting OR conditions on sales channels, and decorrelate the union of distinct customer‑date tuples.
