  "what_worked": "Applied or_to_union, intersect_to_exists: ** Applied UNION-to-EXISTS decorrelation principle by pushing aggregations down into each channel branch before unioning. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control. This reduces data volume before the UNION operation while preserving exact semantics.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~2-3x by eliminating the need to process large numbers of unaggregated rows through the UNION. Each branch now aggregates locally before combining results, which is especially effective when",
