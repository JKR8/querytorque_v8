Pre-computed yearly averages in a separate CTE, reducing window function computation. Applied explicit JOIN syntax and early filtering to reduce intermediate data volume.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.0x (avoids O(n\u00b2) self-join, reduces window function computation, and pushes filters earlier)",
