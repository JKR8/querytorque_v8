  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, intersect_to_exists, date_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join: Isolated May 2000 dates into a tiny CTE, converted IN subqueries to EXISTS for semi-join short-circuiting, split the main UNION into two specialized CTEs with early joins to the date CTE, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer freedom.",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Replacing INTERSECT with EXISTS avoids materializing full intermediate sets; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation reduces join input",
