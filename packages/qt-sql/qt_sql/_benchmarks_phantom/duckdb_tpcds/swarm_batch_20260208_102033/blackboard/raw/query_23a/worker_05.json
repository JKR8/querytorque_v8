  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate: ** Applied dimension isolation by extracting the May 2000 date filter into a dedicated CTE, then pre-computed distinct frequent items and best customers as separate CTEs for efficient hash joins in the main sales queries. This eliminates repeated subquery evaluations and allows the optimizer to use small hash tables for filtering.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.0-2.5x",
