WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates down, and isolating date ranges early to reduce fact table joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Restructure with CTEs to isolate filtered dimension tables, materialize intermediate results, and handle date ranges separately before joining with fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Use aggressive prefetching by pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs, and consolidate operations into single-pass aggregation to minimize scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Apply structural query transformations by converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, decorrelating subqueries, and rethinking intersection patterns for better join planning.
