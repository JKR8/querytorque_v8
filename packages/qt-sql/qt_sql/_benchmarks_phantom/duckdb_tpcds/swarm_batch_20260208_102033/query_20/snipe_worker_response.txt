**Changes**: Applied staged join pipeline (prefetch_fact_join) by creating filtered CTEs for dimensions first, then joining with fact table in a separate CTE before final aggregation and window computation. This reduces early join volume and leverages selective dimension filters.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x by reducing fact table scans through early dimension filtering and sequential join reduction.
