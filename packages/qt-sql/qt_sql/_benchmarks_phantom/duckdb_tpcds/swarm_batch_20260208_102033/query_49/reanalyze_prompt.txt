### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.09x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing filters into subqueries, and materializing repeated computations via CTEs.

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.14x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate shared dimension filters (especially date_dim) into reusable CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce redundant joins across all three channels.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: fail (0.89x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact tables in CTEs, then restructure window computations to run after union or in a single pass to minimize intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 1999
    AND d_moy = 12
),

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, explore alternative set-operation patterns, and consolidate multiple channel subqueries into a single aggregation with conditional logic.

```sql

    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 12

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
