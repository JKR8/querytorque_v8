**Changes**: Collapsed six independent subqueries into a single-pass aggregation using conditional CASE expressions, eliminating five redundant table scans while preserving exact bucket logic.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x (reduces six full scans to one, with minimal conditional computation overhead).
