**Changes**: 
1. **Early dimension filtering**: Created CTEs to pre-filter `item` by price and manufacturer, and `date_dim` by date range before joining.
2. **Inventory filtering with date join**: Created `filtered_inventory` CTE that joins pre-filtered dates with inventory quantity constraints.
3. **EXISTS for store_sales check**: Replaced the expensive store_sales join with an EXISTS subquery to avoid row multiplication before grouping.
4. **DISTINCT elimination**: Used DISTINCT instead of GROUP BY on the final result since we're just eliminating duplicates from joins.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0x+ by reducing join cardinality early and eliminating the expensive group-by operation. The EXISTS pattern avoids materializing the full store_sales join result.
