FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short because they focused on CTE-based pre-filtering without addressing the fundamental join explosion problem. The query joins three fact-like tables (inventory, store_sales) through item with no selective constraints on store_sales. This creates a multiplicative explosion: each item meeting inventory conditions can have thousands of store_sales records. Worker 3's 1.21x gain came from pre-joining inventory with date_dim but still hit the same explosion when joining with store_sales. Worker 4's structural changes (0.45x) added unnecessary complexity with UNIONs without reducing the underlying cartesian effect. Worker 5's EXISTS attempted to address this but retained DISTINCT operations on large intermediate sets. The optimizer likely already pushes predicates, making CTE isolation ineffective without changing the join semantics.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Convert implicit cross join to explicit semi-joins**: Use EXISTS subqueries instead of joins to avoid row multiplication, especially for store_sales which only needs existence check.
2. **Aggressive fact table pruning**: Pre-aggregate or distinct filter fact tables before joining to dimensions.
3. **Materialized intersection**: Compute qualifying item keys from inventory and store_sales separately, then intersect before joining to item details.
4. **Reorder joins completely**: Start with the most selective fact table (inventory with date/quantity filters) as driving table, then semi-join to others.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Transform the query to use two semi-joins (EXISTS) from pre-filtered items to each fact table independently. Pre-compute distinct qualifying keys from inventory with date_dim join to minimize intermediate sizes. Then validate existence in store_sales via efficient semi-join. This avoids the multiplicative explosion while maintaining predicate pushdown benefits.

EXAMPLES: decorrelate, single_pass_aggregation, early_filter
HINT: Start with filtered items, then use EXISTS with pre-joined inventory-date CTE and direct EXISTS to store_sales. Ensure no DISTINCT on large sets—let semi-joins handle uniqueness naturally.
