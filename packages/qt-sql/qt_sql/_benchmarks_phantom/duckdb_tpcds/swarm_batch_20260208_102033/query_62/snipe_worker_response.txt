Changes: Applied multi-dimension prefetch strategy by creating a CTE for date_dim with its selective filter, allowing early reduction of the fact table scan before joining with other dimension tables. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

Expected speedup: 2.0x+ by reducing the web_sales scan through early application of the date filter and improved join ordering.
