## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_and_filter
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into CTEs, filter dimension tables early, and materialize repeated patterns to reduce intermediate data size.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, ship_mode, time) into reusable CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and shared scans.

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure with multiple CTEs to prefetch and pre-join filtered dimensions, and consolidate monthly aggregates into a single scan per fact table for efficiency.

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Explore structural changes: transform OR conditions to UNION ALL, apply EXISTS-based rewrites, and decorrelate patterns to improve join planning and parallelization.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_moy
  FROM date_dim

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
