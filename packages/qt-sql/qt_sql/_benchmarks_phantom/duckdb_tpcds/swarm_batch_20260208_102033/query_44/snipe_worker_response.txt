Changes: Consolidated duplicate aggregations and subqueries into single-pass CTEs, computing both ascending and descending ranks in one pass over filtered item averages. Extracted the repeated scalar subquery into a materialized CTE.

Expected speedup: 2.2x–2.5x from reducing store_sales scans from 4 to 1 and eliminating redundant aggregations.
