WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filtering
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push filters into subqueries, filter dimension tables first, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, decorrelate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension filtering and decorrelate subqueries using CTEs, while reusing shared dimension logic across query parts to reduce repeated work.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_single_pass_restructure
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Aggressively consolidate multiple scans into single-pass aggregations, prefetch filtered dimension-fact joins, and pre-isolate multiple dimensions to minimize table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Apply novel structural transformations: convert patterns to EXISTS, split OR conditions into UNION ALL, and decorrelate complex subqueries using UNION-based approaches.
