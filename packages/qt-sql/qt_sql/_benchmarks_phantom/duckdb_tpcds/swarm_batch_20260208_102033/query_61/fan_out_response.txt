WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filtering
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on basic filter pushdown into subqueries, early dimension table filtering, and simple CTE materialization to reduce intermediate data volumes safely.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, isolating date filtering and sharing dimension filters between the two subqueries.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with facts in CTEs, then consolidate both promotional and total calculations into a single CTE with conditional aggregation to eliminate duplicate scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform OR conditions on promotion channels into UNION ALL branches, restructure subqueries as EXISTS patterns, and decorrelate any implicit dependencies between promotional and total logic.
