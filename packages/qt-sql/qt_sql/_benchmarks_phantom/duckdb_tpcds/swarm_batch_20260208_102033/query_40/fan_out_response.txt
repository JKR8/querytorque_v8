WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: Conservative Early Filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply dimension filtering first to reduce join costs, push predicates down, and materialize reusable filtered dimensions as CTEs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: Dimension Pre-isolation Restructuring
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs before joining with facts, enabling predicate pushdown and dimension reuse across multiple channel joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: Aggressive Multi-CTE Prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts in staged CTEs, then consolidate multiple conditional aggregations into a single scan.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: Novel Structural Transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform conditional logic (CASE to UNION) for better parallelism, apply subquery decorrelation techniques, and explore intersection patterns for join optimization.
