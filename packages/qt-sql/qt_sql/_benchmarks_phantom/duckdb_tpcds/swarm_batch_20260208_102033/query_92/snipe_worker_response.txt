**Changes**: Decorrelated the subquery by pre-computing item average discounts in a CTE and extracting date filtering into a separate CTE to avoid repeated computation. This eliminates the per-row correlated subquery execution.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x by eliminating correlated subquery overhead and sharing date filtering between main query and average computation.
