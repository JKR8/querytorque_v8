WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter the `reason` table first to reduce join volume, push filters into CTE, and materialize filtered dimension data early to optimize the left join pattern.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension table filtering (reason) into a dedicated CTE, then restructure the query to join this pre-filtered dimension with fact tables using explicit joins instead of cross joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter reason table, then pre-join with store_returns to create a filtered returns CTE before joining to store_sales in a single aggregation pass, eliminating cross join inefficiencies.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the CASE logic and cross join into a UNION ALL structure separating returned vs non-returned sales, or explore decorrelation techniques to restructure the dimension join pattern.
