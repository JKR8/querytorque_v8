**Changes**: Applied aggressive prefetch restructuring by creating CTEs that filter dimension tables early, pre-joined filtered dimensions (date → inventory → item), and converted the catalog_sales join to an EXISTS subquery to avoid duplicate row explosion before aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x from reduced intermediate result sizes and better join order control.
