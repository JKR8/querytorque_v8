WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables and push down predicates to reduce data early in the plan, minimizing join costs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension table filters into separate CTEs to enable efficient join ordering and reduce fact table scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, materialize_cte
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs, consolidate operations, and materialize intermediate results for faster aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Transform query structure by splitting conditions, converting set operations, and isolating date ranges for index optimization.
