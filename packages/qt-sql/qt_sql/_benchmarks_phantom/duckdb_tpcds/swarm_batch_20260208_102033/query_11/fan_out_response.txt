WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing year and sale_type filters deeper into CTEs, pre-filtering customer/date dimensions before joins, and materializing intermediate results to reduce repetitive computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolate
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date filtering (dyear=2001/2002) and customer dimension into separate CTEs before joining with sales tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and shared dimension reuse across store/web channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Create separate CTEs for each date range (2001, 2002) and pre-join filtered dimensions with sales facts before aggregation, restructuring the multi-alias self-join into staged pre-aggregated results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, intersect_to_exists, or_to_union
HINT: Split the UNION ALL CTE into separate store/web CTEs, transform the four-way intersection pattern into EXISTS subqueries, and explore converting conditional ratios to UNION ALL branches for better join planning.
