WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters into the base tables/CTEs early to reduce join sizes, and consider materializing filtered dimension data to avoid repeated computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reuse across the query, improving join efficiency.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with multiple CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts, then perform aggregation in a single pass to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural transformations such as splitting OR conditions, converting INTERSECT patterns, or decorrelating subqueries to unlock alternative execution plans.
