You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.27x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply standard filter pushdown and early reduction techniques—pre-filter dimension tables first, then join to facts, and materialize repeating patterns to avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 4
      AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_d2 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
      AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_d3 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10
      AND d_year = 2000
),
store_sales_filtered AS (
    SELECT ss_item_sk,
           ss_store_sk,
           ss_customer_sk,
           ss_ticket_number,
           ss_net_profit
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_d1 ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
),
store_returns_filtered AS (
    SELECT sr_item_sk,
           sr_customer_sk,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.28x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_date_range_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate each date_dim alias into separate CTEs with their respective filters, then pre-filter store and item dimensions before joining with the fact CTEs.

```sql
WITH 
d1_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_moy = 4 
      AND d_year = 2000
),
d2_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 
      AND d_year = 2000
),
d3_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10 
      AND d_year = 2000
),

        ss_item_sk,

```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_fact_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in separate CTEs, then combine results; consider consolidating multiple fact scans into single-pass aggregations where possible.

```sql
-- start query 25 in stream 0 using template query25.tpl
select 
 i_item_id
 ,i_item_desc
 ,s_store_id

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced column "d_year" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "d_date_sk", "ss_addr_sk", "ss_ext_tax", "ss_net_paid", "ss_net_profit"

LINE 18:     SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 4
                                                        ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Explore radical restructuring—convert implicit joins to explicit UNION branches, transform intersection logic to EXISTS, and decorrelate subquery patterns.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  -- Consolidate all date filters into a single CTE
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
