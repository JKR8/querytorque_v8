Changes: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing store averages in a separate CTE, filtered SD stores early into a small CTE, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer planning.

Expected speedup: 2.2x-2.5x from eliminating correlated subquery execution per row and early filtering of SD stores.
