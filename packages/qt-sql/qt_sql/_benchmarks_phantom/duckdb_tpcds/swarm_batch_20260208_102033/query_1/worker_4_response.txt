**Changes**: Eliminated correlated subquery by precomputing store averages in a separate CTE (`store_avg_return`), then joined directly. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3x by removing per-row correlated subquery execution and enabling efficient hash joins with pre-aggregated store averages.
