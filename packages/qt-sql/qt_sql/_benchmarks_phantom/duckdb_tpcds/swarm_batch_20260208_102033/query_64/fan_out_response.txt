WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate result sizes, filter dimension tables early, and reuse computed CTEs to avoid redundant calculations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce fact table scans, especially for shared dimensions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure joins by prefetching filtered dimensions and pre-joining with facts in separate CTEs, and consolidate aggregations where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure by converting patterns (like INTERSECT) to EXISTS, splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.
