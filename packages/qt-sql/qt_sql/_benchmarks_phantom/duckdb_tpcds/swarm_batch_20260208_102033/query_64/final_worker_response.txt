**Changes:** Created a unified `filtered_item` CTE with the item color/price conditions and used it to filter both catalog tables (in `cs_ui`) and store sales early. Pre-joined store sales with filtered items and date dimension d1 (for years 2001-2002) before joining with other dimensions. Restructured `cs_ui` to join catalog tables with filtered items first. This reduces the fact table joins by applying filters at the earliest possible stage.

**Expected speedup:** 2-3x by reducing the volume of catalog and store sales data before complex joins.
