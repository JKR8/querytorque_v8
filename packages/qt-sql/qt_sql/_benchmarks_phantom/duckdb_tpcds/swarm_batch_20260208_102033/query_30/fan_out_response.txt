WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filtering
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables before joins, and materialize repeated patterns to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before fact joins, focusing on date and address dimension isolation to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_correlated_prefetch
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Eliminate correlated subquery via decorrelation, pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs, and prefetch multiple dimension filters before main aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Apply unconventional structural transformations - convert subquery patterns to EXISTS/UNION forms, and explore composite decorrelation for complex patterns.
