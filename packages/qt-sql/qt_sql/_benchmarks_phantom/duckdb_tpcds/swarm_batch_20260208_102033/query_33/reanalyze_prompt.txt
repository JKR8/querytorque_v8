You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown into CTEs, pre-filter dimension tables first, and materialize the repeated item subquery into a shared CTE to avoid redundant computation across all three sales channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
  SELECT
    i_item_sk,
    i_manufact_id
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category IN ('Home')
),
filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
    AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_address AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -5
),

),

### Worker 2: dimension_isolation_multi_channel
- **Status**: pass (0.92x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and isolate each dimension table (date, item, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining with the three sales fact tables, enabling reuse of filtered dimensions across all sales channels.

```sql
-- start query 33 in stream 0 using template query33.tpl
with ss as (
 select
          i_manufact_id,sum(ss_ext_sales_price) total_sales
 from
 	store_sales,
 	date_dim,
         customer_address,
         item
 where
         i_manufact_id in (select
  i_manufact_id
from
 item
where i_category in ('Home'))
 and     ss_item_sk              = i_item_sk
 and     ss_sold_date_sk         = d_date_sk
 and     d_year                  = 2002
 and     d_moy                   = 1

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in dedicated CTEs, then consolidate the three sales streams into a single aggregation pass. Restructure to scan each fact table only once with all necessary filters applied early.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_manufact_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home')
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -5
),
store_sales_filtered AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, ss.ss_ext_sales_price
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN filtered_date d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_address a ON ss.ss_addr_sk = a.ca_address_sk
),
catalog_sales_filtered AS (
    SELECT i.i_manufact_id, cs.cs_ext_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN filtered_item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    JOIN filtered_date d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_address a ON cs.cs_bill_addr_sk = a.ca_address_sk
),
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: structural_transform_decorrelate
- **Status**: pass (0.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the repeated IN subquery using decorrelation techniques, restructure with UNION branches for different conditions, and explore alternative subquery formulations to improve join planning and parallelization.

```sql
WITH home_manufacturers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT i_manufact_id
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category IN ('Home')
),
filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
    AND d_moy = 1
),
filtered_address AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_gmt_offset = -5
),
ss AS (
  SELECT
    i.i_manufact_id,

  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  JOIN item i ON ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  JOIN home_manufacturers hm ON i.i_manufact_id = hm.i_manufact_id
  GROUP BY i.i_manufact_id
),

  SELECT
    i.i_manufact_id,
-- ... (truncated)

- **Status**: pass (1.15x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH home_manufacturers AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT i_manufact_id
  FROM item
  WHERE i_category IN ('Home')
), filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
    AND d_moy = 1
), filtered_addresses AS (

  SELECT
    i.i_manufact_id,
    SUM(cs_ext_sales_price) AS total_sales

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
