## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering to dimension tables and push filters into CTEs to minimize data movement and reduce join sizes before aggregation.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
