Changes: Created filtered CTEs for date_dim and item to apply predicates early before joining to the large fact table. This reduces the fact table join to only relevant rows and allows DuckDB to use filtered dimension tables for join planning.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x by reducing the fact table join cardinality through early dimension filtering.
