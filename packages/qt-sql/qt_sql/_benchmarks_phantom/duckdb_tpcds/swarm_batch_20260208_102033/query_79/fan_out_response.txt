WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters down to dimension tables early and materializing intermediate results to reduce join costs and avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, store, household_demographics) into CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce join sizes before the main aggregation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with fact table in a staged CTE approach, then consolidate aggregations in a single pass to minimize intermediate data movement.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL for better index usage, and flatten any correlated subqueries (if present) to improve parallelization and join planning.
