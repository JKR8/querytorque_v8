You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters earliest possible, materializing filtered dimension tables first, and ensuring predicates propagate into subqueries before joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d_year IN (2000, 2000 + 1, 2000 + 2)
),
filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk
  FROM store
  WHERE s_county IN ('Fairfield County', 'Walker County', 'Daviess County', 'Barrow County')
),
filtered_household AS (
  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE (hd_buy_potential = '501-1000' OR hd_buy_potential = 'Unknown')
    AND hd_vehicle_count > 0
    AND hd_dep_count > hd_vehicle_count
),
store_sales_agg AS (

  HAVING cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5
)

```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate all dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining to fact tables, enabling parallel filter optimization and reducing join cardinality early.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
      AND d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)
),

    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_county IN ('Fairfield County', 'Walker County', 'Daviess County', 'Barrow County')
),

    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE (hd_buy_potential = '501-1000' OR hd_buy_potential = 'Unknown')
      AND hd_vehicle_count > 0
      AND CASE
            WHEN hd_vehicle_count > 0
            THEN hd_dep_count / hd_vehicle_count
            ELSE NULL
          END > 1
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM store_sales
    INNER JOIN filtered_date
        ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact table in staged CTEs, then perform final aggregation; consolidate multiple dimension filters into single-pass CTEs.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)

  SELECT
    ss_ticket_number,

```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.07x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions on hd_buy_potential using UNION ALL, convert case-expression to filterable computed column, and consider decorrelation techniques for the grouping subquery.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
      AND d_year IN (2000, 2001, 2002)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
