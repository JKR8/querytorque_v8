WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Filter dimension tables first to reduce row counts, push predicates into CTEs, and isolate date filtering early to minimize fact table joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining, handle date ranges separately, and prefetch multiple filtered dimensions to reduce join complexity.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table early, extract shared dimension filters, and consolidate aggregations into single-pass CTEs to minimize repeated scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_union_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Split OR conditions into UNION ALL branches for better predicate pushdown, transform set operations to EXISTS, and decorrelate multiple conditions using distinct CTEs.
