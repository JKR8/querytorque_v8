FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short of 2.0x because they optimized the wrong bottleneck. The query has two correlated subqueries (EXISTS and NOT EXISTS) that dominate execution time, but workers focused on dimension table filtering which was already efficient. Worker 1 failed due to syntax error (typo). Worker 2 and 3 achieved only modest gains (1.07-1.09x) by pre-filtering dimensions but keeping correlated subqueries intact. Worker 4's decorrelation attempt (0.02x) was too aggressive and likely generated massive intermediate results. Worker 5's refined approach (1.25x) showed that pre-joining filtered fact data helps, but still didn't address the core performance issue: sequential correlated subquery evaluation for each filtered row.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Index-aware rewriting**: None leveraged potential indexes on cs_order_number, cs_warehouse_sk, cr_order_number
2. **Semi-join transformation**: Convert EXISTS/ NOT EXISTS to IN/ NOT IN with pre-computed distinct sets
3. **Window-based warehouse detection**: Use COUNT(DISTINCT cs_warehouse_sk) OVER (PARTITION BY cs_order_number) to identify multi-warehouse orders in single scan
4. **Early aggregation before exists checks**: Pre-aggregate metrics by order_number before applying warehouse/returns filters
5. **Anti-join with pre-filtered returns**: Filter catalog_returns by date range first based on ship_date logic

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Combine the best pre-filtering from Worker 5 with a novel two-phase decorrelation: First, create a CTE with DISTINCT order numbers that pass dimension filters and have multiple warehouses (using window function). Second, join this to a pre-aggregated fact CTE while excluding returned orders via anti-join. This eliminates nested correlated subqueries while keeping intermediate results minimal.

EXAMPLES: decorrelate, single_pass_aggregation, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs, compute multi-warehouse orders using window function in a separate CTE, pre-aggregate metrics by order_number, then use anti-join for returns instead of NOT EXISTS.
