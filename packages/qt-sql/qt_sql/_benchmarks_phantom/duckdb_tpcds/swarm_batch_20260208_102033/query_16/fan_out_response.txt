WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply basic dimension table filtering first, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize repeated subquery patterns.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables to enable better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Use multi-step CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts, then consolidate correlated subqueries into single-pass aggregations.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: composite_decorrelate_union, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Decorrelate EXISTS subqueries using UNION-based patterns, transform OR conditions, and explore alternative set operation semantics.
