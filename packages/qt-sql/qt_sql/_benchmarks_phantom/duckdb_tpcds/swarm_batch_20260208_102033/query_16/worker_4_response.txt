**Changes**: Decorrelated EXISTS subqueries by converting them to pre-materialized key sets (multi_warehouse_orders, returned_orders) joined via CTEs. Applied early filtering on dimension tables to reduce join sizes.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by eliminating correlated subquery evaluation and enabling better join optimization with pre-filtered dimension sets.
