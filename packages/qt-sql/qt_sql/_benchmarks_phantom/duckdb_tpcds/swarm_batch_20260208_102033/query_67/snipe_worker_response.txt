**Changes:** Applied "prefetch_fact_join" pattern by creating a CTE that pre-filters store_sales using an EXISTS-style subquery on date_dim, reducing the fact table early. Added COALESCE to handle NULLs from ROLLUP for consistent window function partitioning. This transforms the implicit join to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimization.

**Expected speedup:** 2.5x-3.0x by dramatically reducing the fact table rows before complex ROLLUP and window function computation.
