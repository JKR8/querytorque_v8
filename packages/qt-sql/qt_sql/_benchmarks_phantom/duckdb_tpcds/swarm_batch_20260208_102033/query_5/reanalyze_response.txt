FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short because they focused exclusively on dimension table pre-filtering (date_dim) but missed the true bottleneck: massive data shuffling in UNION ALL operations with zero-column filling patterns. Worker 1 had a syntax error, but Workers 2-5 showed diminishing returns (1.36x→1.07x→1.02x→1.15x) because:
1. **Wasted UNION ALL computation**: Each CTE's UNION ALL combines full fact table scans with zeros, forcing DuckDB to materialize and shuffle all columns before aggregation, even though half the columns are always zero per branch.
2. **Late dimension key resolution**: Joining with store/catalog_page/web_site AFTER the UNION ALL forces DuckDB to carry redundant dimension keys (store_sk/page_sk/wsr_web_site_sk) through expensive union operations.
3. **Missed column pruning opportunities**: CAST(0 as decimal(7,2)) generates unnecessary decimal operations and column materialization.
4. **Inefficient web channel left join**: The original web returns join pattern (web_returns LEFT JOIN web_sales) is performed BEFORE date filtering, creating Cartesian product risk.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Eliminate UNION ALL through conditional aggregation**: Replace UNION ALL with single table scans using CASE/SUM over date ranges, reducing data movement by 50%.
2. **Push dimension joins into UNION branches**: Join with dimension tables BEFORE union, then union only the final aggregated/metric columns.
3. **Column elimination via NULL instead of zeros**: Use NULL instead of CAST(0...) to allow DuckDB to optimize storage.
4. **Web channel restructuring**: Transform the problematic left join to a proper union of two independent filtered subqueries.
5. **Parallel channel execution hints**: Use PRAGMA directives or separate CTEs with explicit parallelism.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
1. **Replace UNION ALL with conditional aggregation** in each channel CTE: Scan each fact table once, compute sales and returns metrics via conditional sums on date ranges.
2. **Early dimension key resolution**: Join with dimension tables immediately after filtering fact tables, before any union/aggregation.
3. **Column minimization**: Use NULL instead of zero casts, and only select necessary columns.
4. **Restructure web channel**: Process web_sales and web_returns independently with proper date filters, then union aggregated results.
5. **Aggregate early, union late**: Perform channel-level aggregation before the final union across channels.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Transform each channel CTE from "fact UNION ALL fact2 → join → aggregate" to "filtered_fact1 JOIN dim → aggregate UNION ALL filtered_fact2 JOIN dim → aggregate". For web channel, separate the left join into two independent filtered subqueries. Use NULL for complementary metrics instead of zero casts.
