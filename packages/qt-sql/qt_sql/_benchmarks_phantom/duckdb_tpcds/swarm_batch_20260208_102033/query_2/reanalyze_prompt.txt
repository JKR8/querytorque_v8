## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filtering
- **Status**: fail (2.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Push year filters into the earliest possible CTEs and isolate date_dim filtering to reduce data volume before expensive joins and aggregations.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT 
    d_date_sk,
    d_week_seq,
    d_year,
    d_day_name
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year IN (1998, 1999)

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructure
- **Status**: fail (2.43x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: materialize_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure CTEs to avoid recomputation, pre-filter dimension tables, and consolidate shared dimension logic across both sales channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk, 
        d_week_seq, 
        d_day_name,

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_split
- **Status**: fail (1.51x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: union_cte_split, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
- **Strategy hint**: Split the UNION ALL into channel-specific CTEs, prefilter multiple dimensions, and pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables to minimize intermediate results.

  SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_day_name

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: fail (2.39x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation, or_to_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the two-year comparison into a single-pass aggregation using conditional logic, explore window-function alternatives, and consider UNION restructuring for branching logic.

```sql
WITH wscs AS (
    SELECT ws_sold_date_sk AS sold_date_sk, ws_ext_sales_price AS sales_price

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
