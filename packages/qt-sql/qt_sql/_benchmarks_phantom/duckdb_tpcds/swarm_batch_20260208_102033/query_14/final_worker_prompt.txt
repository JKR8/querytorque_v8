## Optimization Strategy: 1. Create a unified items CTE that scans each sales table once, grouping by (i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id) and collecting a bitmask of channel presence (store=1, catalog=2, web=4). Filter for bitmask=7 (all channels present).
2. Pre-compute avg_sales as a weighted average using SUM(quantity*list_price)/COUNT(*) across all three channels in a single aggregated CTE.
3. Embed the filtered item list and avg_sales constant directly into each channel subquery via JOINs rather than subqueries.
4. For the second query, pre-compute date_sk for the two specific weeks once and reuse.

**Your approach**: Transform the INTERSECT into a UNION ALL with channel identifiers, aggregate to find items present in all three channels, then join directly with sales tables. Pre-filter date_dim into separate CTEs for each distinct filter (3-year range, Nov 2002, week sequences). Use explicit table aliases to avoid ambiguous column references.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. cross_items
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Build the shared item set by intersecting brand/class/category combinations that appear in store, catalog, and web sales during 2000-2002, then map those combinations back to item keys.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows
**Outputs**: [ss_item_sk]
**Dependencies**: item, web_sales (join), item AS iws (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), store_sales (join), item AS iss (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), catalog_sales (join), item AS ics (join), date_dim AS d2 (join)
**Joins**: i_brand_id = brand_id | i_class_id = class_id | i_category_id = category_id
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  i_item_sk AS ss_item_sk
FROM item, (
  SELECT
    iss.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    iss.i_class_id AS class_id,
    iss.i_category_id AS category_id
  FROM store_sales, item AS iss, date_dim AS d1
  WHERE
    ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk
    AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
    AND d1.d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  INTERSECT
  SELECT
    ics.i_brand_id,
    ics.i_class_id,
    ics.i_category_id
  FROM catalog_sales, item AS ics, date_dim AS d2
  WHERE
    cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk
...
```

### 2. avg_sales
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Compute a cross-channel average of quantity*list_price over store, catalog, and web sales for 2000-2002 to serve as the sales threshold.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows
**Flags**: UNION_ALL
**Outputs**: [average_sales]
**Dependencies**: web_sales, date_dim, store_sales, catalog_sales
**Joins**: ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(quantity * list_price) AS average_sales
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_quantity AS quantity,
    ss_list_price AS list_price
  FROM store_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    cs_quantity AS quantity,
    cs_list_price AS list_price
  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    ws_quantity AS quantity,
    ws_list_price AS list_price
...
```

### 3. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Intent**: Aggregate November 2002 sales for each channel over the cross-channel item set, keep groups above the computed average-sales threshold, union channels, and output rollup subtotals by channel and product hierarchy.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [channel, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, SUM(sales), SUM(number_sales)] — ordered by channel ASC, i_brand_id ASC, i_class_id ASC, i_category_id ASC
**Dependencies**: web_sales, item, date_dim, store_sales, catalog_sales, avg_sales, cross_items
**Joins**: ws_item_sk = i_item_sk | ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: ws_item_sk IN (SELECT ss_item_sk FROM cross_items) | d_year = 2000 + 2 | d_moy = 11
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, HASH_JOIN, SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  channel,
  i_brand_id,
  i_class_id,
  i_category_id,
  SUM(sales),
  SUM(number_sales)
FROM (
  SELECT
    'store' AS channel,
    i_brand_id,
    i_class_id,
    i_category_id,
    SUM(ss_quantity * ss_list_price) AS sales,
    COUNT(*) AS number_sales
  FROM store_sales, item, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_item_sk IN (
      SELECT
        ss_item_sk
...

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 2. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 3. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

### 4. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)

            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: pushdown on q74 (0.68xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When splitting a UNION CTE by year, you MUST remove or replace the original UNION CTE. Keeping both the split and original versions causes redundant materialization and extreme cardinality misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Created year-specific CTEs (store_sales_1999, store_sales_2000, etc.) but KEPT the original year_total union CTE alongside them. The optimizer materializes both the split versions and the original union, resulting in redundant computation. Projection cardinality estimates show 10^16x errors from the confused CTE graph.

### Warning 2: pushdown on q31 (0.49xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When creating filtered versions of existing CTEs, always REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs. Keeping both causes redundant materialization and 1000x+ cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
**Why it regressed:** Created both filtered (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) AND original (ss, ws) versions of the same aggregations. The query does a 6-way self-join matching quarterly patterns (Q1->Q2->Q3). Duplicate CTEs doubled materialization and confused the optimizer's cardinality estimates for the multi-self-join.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `i_brand_id`
  3. `i_class_id`
  4. `i_category_id`
  5. `SUM(sales)`
  6. `SUM(number_sales)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
