WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, store, item) into separate CTEs before the main join to reduce fact table rows early. Push filters into CTEs and use explicit joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate all dimension filters into individual CTEs, then join with fact table. Materialize grouped aggregations before window function to simplify the final query.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with the fact table in staged CTEs. Consider consolidating the ROLLUP aggregation into a single-pass CTE before applying the window function.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform the IN-list filter on s_state into UNION ALL branches for parallel filtering. Explore restructuring the ROLLUP logic with set operations to optimize aggregation paths.
