WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (date_dim, store) before joining with fact table; push static zip list filters into subqueries; materialize the complex zip derivation once.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date and store filters into separate CTEs to isolate dimension pruning; pre-filter all dimension tables before joining with fact table to reduce intermediate rows.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with fact table in CTEs; consolidate the two zip subqueries into a single CTE with conditional aggregation to avoid INTERSECT.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the INTERSECT into EXISTS semi-joins; restructure the static zip list as a UNION of small batches for better plan selection; decorrelate the customer subquery using distinct pre-aggregation.
