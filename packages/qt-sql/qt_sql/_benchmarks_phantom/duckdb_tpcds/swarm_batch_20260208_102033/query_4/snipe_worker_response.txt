**Changes**: Split the unified year_total CTE into six specialized CTEs (store/catalog/web × 1999/2000) with year filters pushed down and date_dim pre-filtered, converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This eliminates redundant scanning and filtering in the 6-way self-join.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0–2.5x based on similar patterns (union_cte_split 1.36x, multi_date_range_cte 2.35x).
