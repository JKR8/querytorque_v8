WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Push filters into CTEs early, filter dimension tables before joins, and isolate customer dimension prefetching to reduce row counts in all union branches.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_restructuring
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, union_cte_split, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date filtering into a dedicated CTE, split the UNION ALL by sale_type, and share filtered date_dim across all three sales channels to eliminate redundant filtering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Create separate prefiltered CTEs for each date range (1999, 2000) and each dimension, then pre-join dimensions with facts before the main union to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Transform the self-join pattern to use EXISTS, restructure OR-like conditions in final filters to UNION ALL branches, and attempt to consolidate the three sales channel aggregations into a single pass using conditional aggregation.
