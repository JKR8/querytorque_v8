## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W1 achieved 1.54x via conservative_predicate_pushdown. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. year_total
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Build per-customer, per-year totals for store, catalog, and web channels using the query's channel-specific profitability formula and label each row with its sale type.
**Stats**: 50% Cost | ~1k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, UNION_ALL
**Outputs**: [customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_preferred_cust_flag, customer_birth_country, customer_login, customer_email_address, dyear, year_total, sale_type]
**Dependencies**: customer, web_sales (join), date_dim (join), store_sales (join), catalog_sales (join)
**Joins**: c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk | ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id AS customer_id,
  c_first_name AS customer_first_name,
  c_last_name AS customer_last_name,
  c_preferred_cust_flag AS customer_preferred_cust_flag,
  c_birth_country AS customer_birth_country,
  c_login AS customer_login,
  c_email_address AS customer_email_address,
  d_year AS dyear,
  SUM(
    (
      (

```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Intent**: Self-join channel/year totals for 1999 and 2000 by customer, enforce positive 1999 baselines, compare growth ratios across channels, and keep customers where catalog growth beats both store and web.
**Stats**: 50% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country] — ordered by t_s_secyear.customer_id ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_first_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_last_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_birth_country ASC

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

### 2. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

### 4. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

### 5. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**

 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: pushdown on q74 (0.68xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When splitting a UNION CTE by year, you MUST remove or replace the original UNION CTE. Keeping both the split and original versions causes redundant materialization and extreme cardinality misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Created year-specific CTEs (store_sales_1999, store_sales_2000, etc.) but KEPT the original year_total union CTE alongside them. The optimizer materializes both the split versions and the original union, resulting in redundant computation. Projection cardinality estimates show 10^16x errors from the confused CTE graph.

### Warning 2: pushdown on q31 (0.49xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When creating filtered versions of existing CTEs, always REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs. Keeping both causes redundant materialization and 1000x+ cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
**Why it regressed:** Created both filtered (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) AND original (ss, ws) versions of the same aggregations. The query does a 6-way self-join matching quarterly patterns (Q1->Q2->Q3). Duplicate CTEs doubled materialization and confused the optimizer's cardinality estimates for the multi-self-join.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`
  4. `customer_birth_country`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
