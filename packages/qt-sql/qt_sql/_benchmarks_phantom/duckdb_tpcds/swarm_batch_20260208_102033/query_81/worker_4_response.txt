**Changes**: Decorrelated the subquery by pre-computing state averages in a separate CTE and joining instead of using correlated execution. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.5x based on benchmark patterns for similar decorrelation transforms. The rewrite eliminates per-row recomputation of state averages and enables better join ordering.
