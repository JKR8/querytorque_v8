WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters into CTEs early and materializing repeated subqueries. Keep the original structure but improve filter application order.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension table filtering (date_dim, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining to reduce fact table scans and enable better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with fact tables in CTEs. Consolidate multiple scans into single-pass aggregations where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_decorrelation_transform
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform the correlated subquery using decorrelation techniques. Explore converting the state-based comparison to a JOIN with pre-aggregated averages, potentially using UNION patterns.
