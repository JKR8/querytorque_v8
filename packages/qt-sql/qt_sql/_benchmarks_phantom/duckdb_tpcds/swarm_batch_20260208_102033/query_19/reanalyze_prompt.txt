You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_19
## Target: 2.0x speedup

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Start by filtering dimension tables individually before joining to reduce fact table rows; push all possible filters into CTEs; materialize expensive subpatterns.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 1999
), filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 2
)
SELECT
    i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    i_brand AS brand,
    i_manufact_id,
    i_manufact,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
WHERE SUBSTRING(ca_zip, 1, 5) <> SUBSTRING(s_zip, 1, 5)

    i_brand,
    i_brand_id,
    i_manufact_id,
    i_manufact
ORDER BY
    ext_price DESC,

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Create separate optimized CTEs for each filtered dimension (date, item, customer/address, store) before joining with fact table; isolate shared dimension logic.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 1999
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 2
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
),
filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_zip
    FROM store

SELECT
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    i.i_brand AS brand,

FROM store_sales ss
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in staged CTEs to maximize early reduction; restructure to compute aggregates in single passes where possible.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12
      AND d_year = 1999
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    FROM item

    i_manufact,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform

- **Strategy hint**: Transform the zip code inequality into UNION ALL branches; explore EXISTS alternatives for the cross-table condition; decorrelate any implicit subqueries.

```sql
WITH date_items AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk,
        ss_item_sk,
        ss_ext_sales_price,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
