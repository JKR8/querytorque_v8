Changes: Applied early filtering on the return date dimension (d2) and created a filtered_returns CTE to reduce the store_returns table size before joining with store_sales. This minimizes the expensive multi-key join between the two large fact tables. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x due to reduced fact table join size and early dimension filtering.
