Changes: Implemented aggressive prefetch by first filtering date_dim to the relevant 12-month range, then joining only those keys with catalog_sales to precompute the days difference. This reduces the fact table early and consolidates all CASE logic into a single pass using the precomputed difference.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by reducing the catalog_sales scan to only relevant dates and computing the date difference once.
