WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters down to dimension tables early, materializing intermediate results, and reducing join sizes before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Restructure with CTEs to isolate filtered dimension tables (especially date_dim) before joining, enabling better predicate pushdown and reducing fact table scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, shared_dimension_multi_channel, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Use advanced CTE restructuring to prefilter and pre-join dimensions with facts, share filtered dimensions across channels, and consolidate computations into single-pass scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, decorrelate, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Explore structural transformations like splitting OR conditions, decorrelating subqueries, or converting set operations to exists—even if not directly present, adapt patterns to this query's logic.
