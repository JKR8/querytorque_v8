Changes: Created two CTEs: `filtered_date` to materialize the repeated date filter (2000, months 1-3) and `filtered_address` to push the state filter down early. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and preserved all EXISTS subqueries as-is.

Expected speedup: ~2-3x from reduced row counts before main joins and reuse of date filter materialization.
