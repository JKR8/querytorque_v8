WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push date filters early into CTEs, ensure predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate rows, and consider materializing CTEs for stability.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate shared date filtering into a reusable CTE to eliminate duplicate scans and enable better dimension pushdown across both sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure the multi-CTE pattern by prefetching dimension-filtered fact data, then attempt to consolidate the two channel aggregations into a single pass where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore radical transforms: convert the FULL OUTER JOIN logic to UNION/EXISTS patterns, or decompose the correlation between channels using decorrelation techniques.
