**Changes**: Unified date-item axes first via UNION DISTINCT, then joined daily sales in a single pass, computed cumulative sums with conditional window functions, and applied the web_cumulative > store_cumulative filter immediately after window computation. This eliminates the full outer join and reduces three window functions to one.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x from eliminating redundant window computations and reducing intermediate data volume.
