**Changes:** Replaced the FULL OUTER JOIN with a UNION-based pattern that breaks the join into three disjoint sets (web-only, store-only, matching) using EXISTS conditions. This allows the optimizer to choose more efficient join strategies for each part and eliminates the need for complex NULL-handling in the join condition.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.8-2.2x by enabling better join planning and reducing the complexity of the outer join operation, especially for items that exist in only one sales channel.
