You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_26
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 26 in stream 0 using template query26.tpl
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs early, materializing dimension filters first, and reducing intermediate results through predicate pushdown before joining.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demo AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
),
filtered_promotion AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
)
SELECT
    i_item_id,
    AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1,
    AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2,
    AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3,
    AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_customer_demo ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN filtered_promotion ON cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
JOIN item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
GROUP BY i_item_id
ORDER BY i_item_id

```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (customer_demographics, date_dim, promotion) into separate CTEs before joining with catalog_sales to enable better join planning and reduce fact table scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
  SELECT cd_demo_sk
  FROM customer_demographics
  WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
    AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
    AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
),
filtered_promotions AS (
  SELECT p_promo_sk
  FROM promotion
  WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
),
joined_facts AS (
  SELECT 
    cs_item_sk,
    cs_quantity,
    cs_list_price,
    cs_coupon_amt,
    cs_sales_price
  FROM catalog_sales AS cs
  JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk
  JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
)
SELECT
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins by prefiltering dimensions and pre-joining them with the fact table in staged CTEs, then consolidate aggregations in a single pass to minimize intermediate data movement.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_promotion AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
),
filtered_catalog_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_item_sk,
        cs_quantity,
        cs_list_price,
        cs_coupon_amt,
        cs_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales
    INNER JOIN filtered_customer_demographics 
        ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_date 
        ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_promotion 
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.51x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the query structure by splitting the OR condition on promotion into UNION ALL branches, converting potential subquery patterns, and decorrelating joins for better parallelism and index usage.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
), filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
), promotion_branch1 AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N'
), promotion_branch2 AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_event = 'N'
      AND (p_channel_email IS NULL OR p_channel_email != 'N')
), union_sales AS (
    SELECT
        i.i_item_id,
        cs.cs_quantity,
        cs.cs_list_price,
        cs.cs_coupon_amt,
        cs.cs_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    INNER JOIN filtered_date d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_customer_demographics cd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk
    INNER JOIN item i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
-- ... (truncated)

    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
