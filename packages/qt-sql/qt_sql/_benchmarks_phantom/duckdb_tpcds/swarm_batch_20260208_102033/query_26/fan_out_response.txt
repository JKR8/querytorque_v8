WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs early, materializing dimension filters first, and reducing intermediate results through predicate pushdown before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (customer_demographics, date_dim, promotion) into separate CTEs before joining with catalog_sales to enable better join planning and reduce fact table scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure joins by prefiltering dimensions and pre-joining them with the fact table in staged CTEs, then consolidate aggregations in a single pass to minimize intermediate data movement.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the query structure by splitting the OR condition on promotion into UNION ALL branches, converting potential subquery patterns, and decorrelating joins for better parallelism and index usage.
