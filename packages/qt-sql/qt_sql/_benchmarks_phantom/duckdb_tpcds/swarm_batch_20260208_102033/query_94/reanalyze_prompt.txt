You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_94
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 94 in stream 0 using template query94.tpl
select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '2000-2-01' and 
           (cast('2000-2-01' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = 'OK'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filtering
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply simple, safe optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates into joins, and materializing reusable subquery results.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-2-01' AND (

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
