You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.76x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into CTEs early to reduce intermediate data volume, apply predicate pushdown to dimension joins, and consider materializing CTEs for reuse in the multi-instance self-join.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
),
ss AS (
    SELECT
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales

    JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.77x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter date_dim and customer_address into isolated CTEs before joining with fact tables, then share these filtered dimensions across both store and web sales CTEs to eliminate redundant filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_qoy, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2000
), filtered_customer_address AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_county
  FROM customer_address
), ss AS (
  SELECT
    ca_county,
    d_qoy,
    d_year,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
), ws AS (
  SELECT
    ca_county,
    d_qoy,
    d_year,
    SUM(ws_ext_sales_price) AS web_sales
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN filtered_date ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_customer_address ON ws_bill_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
)
SELECT
  ss1.ca_county,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.77x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure the quarter comparisons using conditional aggregation in a single CTE pass instead of six self-joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_qoy, d_year
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_qoy IN (1, 2, 3)
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_county
    FROM customer_address
),

    SELECT
        ca_county,
        d_qoy,
        d_year,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS store_sales
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer_address ON ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year

    GROUP BY ca_county, d_qoy, d_year
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Not implemented Error: Non-inner join on correlated columns not supported
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the complex self-join pattern using UNION-based rewrites, explore EXISTS for quarter progression logic, and decorrelate any implied dependencies between store and web sales comparisons.

WITH filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT
    ca_county,
    d_qoy,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
