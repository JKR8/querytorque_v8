```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, incremental optimizations by pushing filters early into CTEs, reducing join cardinality before complex operations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_prefiltering
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate and pre-filter all dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in separate CTEs, then consolidate with customer for single-pass aggregation.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, decorrelate
HINT: Transform OR EXISTS logic into UNION ALL, decorrelate subqueries into pre-aggregated CTEs, and restructure joins.
