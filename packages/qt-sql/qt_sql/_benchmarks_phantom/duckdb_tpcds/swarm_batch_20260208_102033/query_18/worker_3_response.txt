**Changes:** Applied aggressive prefetch restructuring: created CTEs for all filtered dimensions (date, customer demographics, customer, address), pre-joined them with the fact table in a single CTE, then performed the final join with the remaining unfiltered dimension and aggregation in a single pass.

**Expected speedup:** ~2.5-3.5x due to early reduction of fact table rows via selective dimension filters and consolidated single-pass aggregation.
