```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply aggressive early filtering on dimension tables before joins, push predicates into base tables, and materialize reusable filtered subsets to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into isolated CTEs before joining with the fact table, ensuring predicate pushdown and reuse of filtered dimension sets.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in CTEs, prefetch multiple dimension subsets, and consolidate aggregations into single-pass computations.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform OR/IN conditions into UNION ALL branches, rewrite intersection patterns as EXISTS, and decorrelate nested patterns through distinct pre-materialization.
