FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts fell short because they only addressed surface-level optimizations (predicate pushdown, CTE materialization) without tackling the core bottleneck: the three separate CTEs perform identical joins with `item` and `date_dim` for each sales channel, tripling dimension table processing. Worker 3's single-pass aggregation attempted to consolidate but failed (0.93x) due to UNION ALL over non-aggregated fact tables, creating a massive intermediate set before aggregation. Worker 2's error stems from ambiguous column references in CTE joins. The key missed opportunity is that each channel CTE independently filters the same week in `date_dim` and joins the full `item` table—this repetitive work dominates execution time.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Dimension pre-join with fact aggregation**: Pre-join `item` with each sales table only once via a shared filtered dimension CTE, then compute channel aggregates in a single pass.
2. **Conditional aggregation without UNION ALL**: Use a single CTE that joins `date_dim` once, then conditionally aggregates each channel's sales via `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)` grouped by item_id.
3. **Redundant condition elimination**: The six pairwise revenue filters are mathematically redundant—only three are needed (e.g., A≈B, A≈C, B≈C), reducing predicate evaluation.
4. **Early aggregation before join**: Aggregate sales per item per channel before joining with dimensions to minimize intermediate rows.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a single CTE that joins `date_dim` (filtered for the target week) with all three sales tables via LEFT JOINs on date_sk and item_sk, then perform conditional aggregation to compute ss_item_rev, cs_item_rev, and ws_item_rev in one pass. This eliminates repetitive dimension processing and reduces intermediate data movement. Finally, simplify the revenue filters to three non-redundant conditions.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, dimension_cte_isolate, early_filter
HINT: Use a single CTE with LEFT JOINs from date_dim to each sales table (via date_sk) and to item, then GROUP BY i_item_id with SUM(CASE WHEN sales_table = 'store' THEN ...) for each channel's revenue. Filter with three conditions: ss_item_rev between 0.9*cs_item_rev and 1.1*cs_item_rev, and similarly for ss-ws and cs-ws.
