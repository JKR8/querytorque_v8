**Changes:** 
1. Created a single-pass CTE that joins `item` with all three sales tables via LEFT JOINs filtered by target week dates, computing all three revenue columns in one aggregation.
2. Simplified the six pairwise revenue filters to three non-redundant conditions (any two comparisons imply the third).
3. Removed redundant subqueries by pre-computing target week dates once.

**Expected speedup:** 2-3x from eliminating three separate date_dim scans, reducing intermediate data movement, and simplifying filter evaluation.
