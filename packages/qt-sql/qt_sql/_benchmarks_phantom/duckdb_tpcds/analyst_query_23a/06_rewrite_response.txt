**Changes:** Merged duplicate store_sales scans for 2000-2003 period into a single filtered CTE, pre-filtered best_ss_customer to only customers with 2000-2003 sales, converted IN subqueries to JOINs with distinct keys, and extracted shared date filter for main query.

**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3x due to eliminating redundant store_sales scans and enabling better join optimization.
