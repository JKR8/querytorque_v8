You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**ws CTE**: Computes annual aggregates (quantity, costs, revenue) for web sales that were not returned, grouped by year, item, and customer. Scans web_sales (~millions), filters via LEFT JOIN to web_returns, and joins date_dim (~365K rows). Outputs ~1K rows (all years).

**cs CTE**: Same logic as ws but for catalog sales. Scans catalog_sales (~millions), catalog_returns, and date_dim. Outputs ~1K rows (all years).

**ss CTE**: Same logic as ws/cs but for store sales. Scans store_sales (~millions), store_returns, and date_dim. Outputs ~1K rows (all years).

**main_query**: Joins all three CTEs on (year, item, customer), filters to year 2000 and requires at least some web/catalog sales, computes ratios, and returns top 100 by complex ordering. Processes ~1K rows from each CTE, but the joins happen *after* each CTE has aggregated all years.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost mechanism is **three independent full scans of massive fact tables (web_sales, catalog_sales, store_sales) with GROUP BY aggregations across ALL YEARS**, when only year 2000 data is needed in the final output.

**Root cause**: The date filter (`ss_sold_year = 2000`) is applied in the main query *after* the CTEs have already aggregated all historical data. Each CTE:
1. Scans the entire fact table (millions of rows)
2. Joins with date_dim to get d_year (without filtering)
3. Groups by d_year (all years)
4. Outputs aggregated data for all years

The main query then filters to year 2000, discarding 99%+ of the aggregated work. This is a classic **late filtering** problem where expensive aggregations run before predicates are applied.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Push year filter into CTEs**
- **What**: Add `WHERE d_year = 2000` to each CTE's date_dim join condition
- **Why**: Reduces each fact table scan from millions to thousands of rows, and cuts GROUP BY cardinality by >99%
- **Risk**: None – main query already filters to 2000, and CTEs are only joined on matching years
- **Impact**: **Significant** (reduces each CTE's work by ~99%)

**Change 2: Create a pre-filtered date_dim CTE**
- **What**: Extract `SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000` into a CTE, then join all fact tables to it
- **Why**: Ensures optimizer applies the filter early; DuckDB can use this small CTE for efficient hash joins
- **Risk**: None – maintains same semantics with explicit early filtering
- **Impact**: **Moderate** (ensures filter pushdown, helps join planning)

**Change 3: Combine the three CTEs' date_dim joins**
- **What**: Create a single date CTE: `dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk, d_year FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000)` and have all CTEs reference it
- **Why**: Avoids three separate scans of date_dim; the small filtered result is reused
- **Risk**: None – date_dim is a dimension table, safe to pre-filter
- **Impact**: **Minor** (date_dim is small, but reduces repeated work)

### Recommended Approach
Implement **Change 1 + Change 2**: Create a pre-filtered date CTE for year 2000, then modify each sales CTE to:
1. Join to the filtered date CTE instead of the full date_dim
2. Keep the LEFT JOIN to returns tables unchanged
3. Maintain the `wr/cr/sr_order_number IS NULL` filter

This ensures:
- Each fact table scans only 2000 data (~1/7th of typical TPC-DS scale)
- The GROUP BY processes ~1/7th the data
- Hash joins use the small date CTE as build side
- All semantic constraints preserved (non-returned sales only)

Implementation:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year 
  FROM date_dim 
  WHERE d_year = 2000
),
ws AS (
  SELECT
    d.d_year AS ws_sold_year,
    ws_item_sk,
    ws_bill_customer_sk AS ws_customer_sk,
    SUM(ws_quantity) AS ws_qty,
    SUM(ws_wholesale_cost) AS ws_wc,
    SUM(ws_sales_price) AS ws_sp
  FROM web_sales
  LEFT JOIN web_returns
    ON wr_order_number = ws_order_number AND ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk
  JOIN filtered_dates d
    ON ws_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  WHERE wr_order_number IS NULL
  GROUP BY d.d_year, ws_item_sk, ws_bill_customer_sk
),
... (similar for cs, ss)
-- main query unchanged (but remove ss_sold_year = 2000 filter as it's now redundant)
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

The FAISS selection is partially relevant:
- **shared_dimension_multi_channel**: Good match – we're applying the same date filter across multiple sales channels
- **deferred_window_aggregation**: Not relevant – no window functions here
- **intersect_to_exists**: Not relevant – no INTERSECT operations

Additional relevant examples:
- **early_filter**: Directly addresses pushing dimension filters before fact table joins
- **pushdown**: Specifically about pushing outer filters into CTEs
- **dimension_cte_isolate**: Pre-filtering dimension tables into CTEs

**Final selection**:
```
EXAMPLES: shared_dimension_multi_channel, early_filter, pushdown
```

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

```

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)

      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk

```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

**AFTER (fast):**

```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

**AFTER (fast):**
[quantity_1_20_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20
```
[quantity_21_40_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40
```
[quantity_41_60_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60
```
[quantity_61_80_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80
```
[quantity_81_100_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100
```
[main_query]:
```sql

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.
