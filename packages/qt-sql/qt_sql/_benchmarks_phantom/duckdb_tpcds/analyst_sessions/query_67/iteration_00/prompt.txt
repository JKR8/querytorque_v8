You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate store sales quantity*price under a multi-level ROLLUP, compute rank by descending sumsales within each category, and retain rows with rank <= 100.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~5.4M rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [*] — ordered by i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_brand ASC, i_product_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, d_moy ASC, s_store_id ASC, sumsales ASC, rk ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim, store, item
**Filters**: rk <= 100
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store], SEQ_SCAN[item], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**Innermost subquery (dw1)**: Computes aggregated sales (price × quantity) for store sales over a 12-month period (month_seq 1206-1217). Joins store_sales (fact table) with date_dim (date filter), store, and item (dimensions). Uses ROLLUP to generate hierarchical subtotals across 8 grouping dimensions. Processes ~5.4M fact rows with dimensions, outputs aggregated rows for all grouping combinations.

**Middle subquery (dw2)**: Computes rank within each i_category partition based on sumsales DESC. Takes dw1's aggregated result, applies window function to rank sales performance per category across all ROLLUP levels (including subtotal rows where some dimensions are NULL).

**Outer query**: Filters to top 100 ranks per category, orders by all 10 columns (including grouping dimensions and sumsales), then limits to 100 total rows. Final output shows top performers within each category across multiple aggregation levels.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost center is the **large ROLLUP aggregation on 5.4M fact rows joined with 3 dimension tables**. The MECHANISM causing slowness is:

1. **Unfiltered dimension joins**: All three dimension tables (date_dim, store, item) are joined in their entirety before any aggregation, though only date_dim has a filter predicate.
2. **Excessive ROLLUP cardinality**: ROLLUP on 8 columns generates 2^8 = 256 grouping sets. With 5.4M input rows, this creates massive intermediate results before the window function.
3. **Late filtering**: The rank filter (rk <= 100) and LIMIT 100 are applied AFTER computing the entire ROLLUP and window function, wasting computation on rows that won't make the final cut.

The window function itself partitions by i_category and sorts by sumsales DESC, which requires a sort of the entire ROLLUP result per category. This is expensive but a symptom of the large input, not the root cause.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Optimization 1: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs before join**
- **What**: Extract filtered date_dim (month_seq filter), store (no filter), and item (no filter) into separate CTEs before joining with store_sales.
- **Why**: DuckDB can build smaller hash tables for dimension joins. The date_dim filter reduces dimension size early, and separate CTEs help the optimizer push predicates.
- **Risk**: Must ensure all needed columns are preserved (d_year, d_qoy, d_moy from date_dim). No semantic change.
- **Estimated impact**: Moderate (1.3-1.5x)

**Optimization 2: Push rank filtering into subquery**
- **What**: Convert RANK() window to use QUALIFY clause or move filter earlier: `QUALIFY RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) <= 100`
- **Why**: DuckDB's optimizer may push the rank filter down, reducing the amount of data sorted and processed by the window function. Currently processes all ROLLUP rows, then filters 99%+ away.
- **Risk**: QUALIFY syntax may not be supported or may change semantics with NULL groups from ROLLUP. Must test thoroughly.
- **Estimated impact**: Significant (2-3x if optimization works)

**Optimization 3: Eliminate unnecessary ROLLUP columns for ranking**
- **What**: The business question likely wants ranking at the most granular level (product-store-month), but ROLLUP creates aggregated rows (like category totals) that also get ranked. Consider if business logic requires ranking aggregated subtotals.
- **Why**: If only granular rankings matter, remove ROLLUP or filter out aggregated rows (where any grouping column is NULL) before ranking.
- **Risk**: Changes semantics if business needs category/subcategory rankings.
- **Estimated impact**: Major (3-5x reduction in rows to rank)

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Previous attempt: date_cte_isolate → REGRESSION (0.85x)**
- **Why it failed**: Isolating date_dim into a CTE likely prevented join reordering or predicate pushdown that DuckDB's optimizer could do with the original explicit joins. The date filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN) is already selective; forcing materialization may have added overhead.
- **Constraint learned**: DuckDB's optimizer handles simple dimension filtering well in explicit joins. Structural changes must preserve the optimizer's ability to reorder joins based on statistics.

### Recommended Approach
Implement a **two-phase filtering strategy**:

1. **Create filtered fact CTE**: First join store_sales with ONLY date_dim (filtered) to reduce fact rows early using the selective date predicate. This leverages date_dim's small size and selective filter.
   
2. **Materialize dimension CTEs**: Create CTEs for store and item with only needed columns (store_id, item category/brand/etc.) to serve as dimension lookups.

3. **Join filtered fact with dimensions**: Join the reduced fact set with store and item CTEs.

4. **Apply QUALIFY for early rank filtering**: Use DuckDB's QUALIFY clause to filter during window computation rather than after.

The key insight: **date_dim is the most selective filter and should be applied BEFORE other dimension joins**. Store and item have no filters, so joining them early adds cost without reducing rows.

Implementation sketch:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206 + 11
),
filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT ss_sales_price, ss_quantity, ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk,
         d.d_year, d.d_qoy, d.d_moy
  FROM store_sales ss
  JOIN filtered_dates d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
),
item_dim AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name
  FROM item
),
store_dim AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_id
  FROM store
)
SELECT i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
       d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
FROM (
  SELECT i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
         d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id,
         SUM(COALESCE(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity, 0)) AS sumsales
  FROM filtered_sales fs
  JOIN item_dim i ON fs.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  JOIN store_dim s ON fs.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
                  d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
) dw1
QUALIFY rk <= 100
ORDER BY i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
         d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, rk
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

**FAISS picks**: deferred_window_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, decorrelate

**My selection**: 
- **prefetch_fact_join** (most relevant): Pre-filtering date_dim and pre-joining with fact table matches our strategy.
- **early_filter**: Directly applicable - filter date_dim first before other joins.
- **dimension_cte_isolate**: Creating CTEs for store and item dimensions isolates them for cleaner optimization.

**Why not deferred_window_aggregation**: The window function depends on the ROLLUP aggregation result, so it cannot be deferred past joins. The window is the final computation step.

**Why not decorrelate**: No correlated subqueries in this query.

EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: date_cte_isolate on q67 (0.85xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize dimension filters into CTEs before complex aggregations (ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS) with window functions. The optimizer needs to push aggregation through joins; CTEs create materialization barriers.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized date, store, and item dimension filters into CTEs before a ROLLUP aggregation with window functions (RANK() OVER). CTE materialization prevents the optimizer from pushing the ROLLUP and window computation down through the join tree, forcing a full materialized intermediate before the expensive aggregation.

### Warning 2: date_cte_isolate on q51 (0.87xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering together.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized cumulative window functions (SUM() OVER ORDER BY) into separate CTEs (web_v1, store_v1) before a FULL OUTER JOIN that filters on web_cumulative > store_cumulative. The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract
