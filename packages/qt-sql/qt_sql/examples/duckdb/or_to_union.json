This duplicates the entire fact table scan for each branch with no selectivity benefit. Only apply when OR conditions span DIFFERENT tables or fundamentally different column families. Also never split into more than 3 UNION branches \u2014 each branch rescans the fact table. Caused 0.59x on a same-column time-range split and historically 0.23x-0.41x on queries with 9+ UNION branches."
