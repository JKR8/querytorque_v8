  "description": "When 3 fact tables (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales) each join date_dim via comma join with the same date filter (d_year=2000, d_moy=2), Snowflake may not push the date_sk range to the fact table scans for micro-partition pruning. Fix: look up the date_sk range and add explicit sold_date_sk BETWEEN predicates on each fact table. Also convert comma joins to explicit JOINs.",
  "verified_speedup": "1.17x",
  "principle": "Predicate Transitivity on multi-fact queries: when multiple fact tables are comma-joined to date_dim with the same date filter, Snowflake may not infer the date_sk range for fact table pruning. Adding explicit sold_date_sk BETWEEN on each fact table forces micro-partition pruning. Combined with comma-to-explicit JOIN conversion.",
