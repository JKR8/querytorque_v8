Apply MULTI-NODE predicate pushdown optimization using node-level rewrites.

TASK: Push WHERE conditions through multiple CTE/subquery layers to base table scans.

{dag_prompt}

{pushdown_analysis}

## Strategy

For each pushable predicate path listed above:
1. Add the predicate to the target node's WHERE clause
2. Adjust column names according to the column_chain (columns may be aliased)
3. Keep the original predicate in place (don't remove it)

## Example

Given this pushdown path:
- From: main_query
- To: cte1
- Predicate: customer_id = 100
- Column path: customer_id → customer_id

Before:
```sql
cte1: SELECT customer_id, amount FROM sales
```

After:
```sql
cte1: SELECT customer_id, amount FROM sales WHERE customer_id = 100
```

## Rules

1. Only push predicates marked as "pushable" in the analysis above
2. Push through GROUP BY ONLY if filter column IS a GROUP BY column
3. Adjust column names based on column_chain (left-to-right = outer-to-inner)
4. Keep original filters in place - redundancy is OK
5. For equality predicates (=, IN), always safe to push through GROUP BY on same column
6. For range predicates (<, >, BETWEEN), same rule applies
7. NEVER push filters that would change result set semantics

Return JSON with rewrites for each target node you're modifying:
```json
{{"rewrites": {{"target_node_id": "SELECT ... WHERE pushed_predicate ..."}}, "explanation": "..."}}
