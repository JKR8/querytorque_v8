Apply ONLY predicate pushdown optimization using node-level rewrites.

TASK: Push WHERE conditions as close to base tables as possible.

{dag_prompt}

Rules:
1. Move predicates that filter on a single table into that node's CTE or subquery
2. Push predicates through inner joins when safe
3. Push predicates into CTEs if they filter on CTE columns only
4. Do NOT change join types, column lists, or aggregations
5. Preserve exact query semantics - same rows, same values
6. Return JSON with rewrites for affected nodes only

Return JSON:
```json
{{"rewrites": {{"node_id": "SELECT ..."}}, "explanation": "..."}}
```
