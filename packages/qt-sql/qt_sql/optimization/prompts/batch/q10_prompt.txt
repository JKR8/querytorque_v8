Optimize this SQL query.

## Execution Plan

**Operators by cost:**
- SEQ_SCAN (store_sales): 32.7% cost, 105,653 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer): 21.6% cost, 1,999,334 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 11.1% cost, 27,873 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer_address): 10.9% cost, 1,000,000 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (customer_demographics): 9.1% cost, 1,920,349 rows

**Table scans:**
- customer_demographics: 1,920,349 rows ← FILTERED by cd_demo_sk<=1920798
- customer: 1,999,334 rows (NO FILTER)
- customer_address: 1,000,000 rows ← FILTERED by optional: ca_county IN ('Storey County', 'Marquett
- store_sales: 105,653 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 120 rows ← FILTERED by ['d_year=2001', 'd_moy>=1 AND d_moy<=4']
- web_sales: 27,873 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 120 rows ← FILTERED by ['d_year=2001', 'd_moy>=1 AND d_moy<=4']
- catalog_sales: 53,501 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 120 rows ← FILTERED by ['d_year=2001', 'd_moy>=1 AND d_moy<=4']

## Optimization Patterns

These patterns have produced >2x speedups:

1. **Dimension filter hoisting**: If a filtered dimension is in main_query but the CTE aggregates fact data that COULD be filtered by it (via FK), move the dimension join+filter INTO the CTE to filter early.

2. **Correlated subquery to window function**: A correlated subquery computes an aggregate per group. Fix: Replace with a window function in the CTE (e.g., `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)`).

3. **Join elimination**: A table is joined only to validate a foreign key exists, but no columns from it are used. Fix: Remove the join, add `WHERE fk_column IS NOT NULL`.

4. **UNION ALL decomposition**: Complex OR conditions cause full scans. Fix: Split into separate queries with simple filters, UNION ALL results.

5. **Scan consolidation**: Same table scanned multiple times with different filters. Fix: Single scan with CASE WHEN expressions to compute multiple aggregates conditionally.

**Verify**: Optimized query must return identical results.

select 
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_education_status,
  count(*) cnt1,

  ca_county in ('Storey County','Marquette County','Warren County','Cochran County','Kandiyohi County') and
  cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk and 
  exists (select *
          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and

## Output

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "operations": [...],
  "semantic_warnings": [],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

### Operations

| Op | Fields | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `add_cte` | `after`, `name`, `sql` | Insert new CTE |
| `delete_cte` | `name` | Remove CTE |
| `replace_cte` | `name`, `sql` | Replace entire CTE body |
| `replace_clause` | `target`, `sql` | Replace clause (`""` to remove) |
| `patch` | `target`, `patches[]` | Snippet search/replace |

### Example
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "replace_cte", "name": "my_cte", "sql": "SELECT sk, SUM(val) FROM t WHERE sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY sk"}
  ],
  "semantic_warnings": ["Removed join - added IS NOT NULL to preserve filtering"],
  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary dimension join, using FK directly"
}
```

### Block ID Syntax
```
{cte}.select    {cte}.from    {cte}.where    {cte}.group_by    {cte}.having
main_query.union[N].select    main_query.union[N].from    ...
```

### Rules
1. **Return 1-5 operations maximum** - focus on highest-impact changes first
2. Operations apply sequentially
3. `patch.search` must be unique within target clause
4. `add_cte.sql` = query body only (no CTE name)
5. All CTE refs must resolve after ops
6. When removing a join, update column references (e.g., `c_customer_sk` → `ss_customer_sk AS c_customer_sk`)

The system will iterate if more optimization is possible. You don't need to fix everything at once.
