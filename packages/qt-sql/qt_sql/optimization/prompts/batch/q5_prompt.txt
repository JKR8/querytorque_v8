Optimize this SQL query.

## Execution Plan

**Operators by cost:**
- SEQ_SCAN (store_sales): 57.9% cost, 28,788 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 18.2% cost, 7,685 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (store_returns): 8.2% cost, 1,477 rows
- SEQ_SCAN (web_sales): 3.9% cost, 719,646 rows
- HASH_GROUP_BY: 1.9% cost, 1,097 rows

**Table scans:**
- store_sales: 28,788 rows (NO FILTER)
- store_returns: 1,477 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 15 rows ← FILTERED by (CAST(d_date AS TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN '2000-08-19 00:
- store: 400 rows ← FILTERED by s_store_sk<=400
- catalog_sales: 15,340 rows (NO FILTER)
- catalog_returns: 699 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 15 rows ← FILTERED by (CAST(d_date AS TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN '2000-08-19 00:
- catalog_page: 17,108 rows ← FILTERED by cp_catalog_page_sk<=17108
- web_sales: 7,685 rows (NO FILTER)
- web_sales: 719,646 rows (NO FILTER)
- web_returns: 71,681 rows (NO FILTER)
- date_dim: 15 rows ← FILTERED by (CAST(d_date AS TIMESTAMP) BETWEEN '2000-08-19 00:

## Optimization Patterns

These patterns have produced >2x speedups:

1. **Dimension filter hoisting**: If a filtered dimension is in main_query but the CTE aggregates fact data that COULD be filtered by it (via FK), move the dimension join+filter INTO the CTE to filter early.

2. **Correlated subquery to window function**: A correlated subquery computes an aggregate per group. Fix: Replace with a window function in the CTE (e.g., `AVG(...) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)`).

3. **Join elimination**: A table is joined only to validate a foreign key exists, but no columns from it are used. Fix: Remove the join, add `WHERE fk_column IS NOT NULL`.

4. **UNION ALL decomposition**: Complex OR conditions cause full scans. Fix: Split into separate queries with simple filters, UNION ALL results.

5. **Scan consolidation**: Same table scanned multiple times with different filters. Fix: Single scan with CASE WHEN expressions to compute multiple aggregates conditionally.

**Verify**: Optimized query must return identical results.

## Output

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "operations": [...],
  "semantic_warnings": [],
  "explanation": "..."
}
```

### Operations

| Op | Fields | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `add_cte` | `after`, `name`, `sql` | Insert new CTE |
| `delete_cte` | `name` | Remove CTE |
| `replace_cte` | `name`, `sql` | Replace entire CTE body |
| `replace_clause` | `target`, `sql` | Replace clause (`""` to remove) |
| `patch` | `target`, `patches[]` | Snippet search/replace |

### Example
```json
{
  "operations": [
    {"op": "replace_cte", "name": "my_cte", "sql": "SELECT sk, SUM(val) FROM t WHERE sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY sk"}
  ],
  "semantic_warnings": ["Removed join - added IS NOT NULL to preserve filtering"],
  "explanation": "Removed unnecessary dimension join, using FK directly"
}
```

### Block ID Syntax
```
{cte}.select    {cte}.from    {cte}.where    {cte}.group_by    {cte}.having
main_query.union[N].select    main_query.union[N].from    ...
```

### Rules
1. **Return 1-5 operations maximum** - focus on highest-impact changes first
2. Operations apply sequentially
3. `patch.search` must be unique within target clause
4. `add_cte.sql` = query body only (no CTE name)
5. All CTE refs must resolve after ops
6. When removing a join, update column references (e.g., `c_customer_sk` → `ss_customer_sk AS c_customer_sk`)

The system will iterate if more optimization is possible. You don't need to fix everything at once.
