On queries with expensive non-equi joins (inventory quantity < sales quantity, week_seq correlation), reducing both dimension AND fact table sizes before the join dramatically cuts the search space.

    "key_insight": "When a query has expensive non-equi joins (inv_quantity < cs_quantity, d_week_seq correlation across 3 date_dim instances), reducing BOTH dimension AND fact table sizes before the join dramatically shrinks the search space. MATERIALIZED CTEs on PG12+ force early execution. The fact table CTE (cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN x AND y) removes ~70% of catalog_sales rows before hitting the inventory join. Combined with tiny dimension CTEs (date: ~365 rows from 73K, item: 3 categories, cd/hd: single-value filters), the optimizer gets much smaller inputs for the expensive joins.",
    "pattern_detection": "Look for multi-table star-schema queries with: (1) expensive non-equi joins (quantity comparisons, date arithmetic), (2) a range filter on the fact table that removes >50% of rows, (3) multiple dimension filters. The combination of MATERIALIZED dimension CTEs + fact table pre-filter works when the non-equi joins dominate cost."
