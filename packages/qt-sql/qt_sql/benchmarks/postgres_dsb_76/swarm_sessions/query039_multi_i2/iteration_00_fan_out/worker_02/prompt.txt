You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes inventory variability, comparing coefficient of variation between consecutive months (May vs June 2002) for Sports/Shoes items managed by specific managers. The business intent is to identify items with high inventory volatility. JOIN semantics are INNER throughout—all dimension tables must match the fact table, and the self-join requires matching warehouse and item. Aggregation trap: STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 values per group; NULL groups are filtered out by CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN NULL. Filter dependencies: The cov>1 filter in CTE must be applied BEFORE the self-join; the d_moy=5/6 filters in main query are independent per side.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pivoting with MAX(CASE) requires each (warehouse,item,month) has exactly one row (guaranteed by GROUP BY)
- Must handle NULL when month missing (filter out rows where either month missing)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTE prevents parallel table scan on inventory
   RULE: Use LATERAL or subquery instead of CTE for fact table scan when parallel execution is needed
2. UNION ALL over-splitting (observed 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL when PostgreSQL's bitmap scan handles it better
   RULE: Do NOT convert OR to UNION ALL—this query has no OR conditions requiring split

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output 10 columns in exact order: inv1.w_warehouse_sk, inv1.i_item_sk, inv1.d_moy, inv1.mean, inv1.cov, inv2.w_warehouse_sk, inv2.i_item_sk, inv2.d_moy, inv2.mean, inv2.cov
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov for downstream self-join and SELECT
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: 2002, 'Shoes','Sports', 42, 61, 791, 991, 5, 1, 1.5 (second query)
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows—cov>1 filter in CTE and month filters in main query are critical
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTE uses comma-separated joins (inventory, item, warehouse, date_dim)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: CTE contains all months, filtered late in main query (d_moy=5/6)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_self_join_decomposition: Apply single materialization of fact+dimensions; ignore deriving different aggregates—we need same aggregates for different months
- single_pass_aggregation: Apply single scan with CASE pivoting; ignore FILTER clauses (use MAX(CASE) for safety with STDDEV_SAMP)
- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply staged reduction with dimension CTEs; ignore non-equi join aspect

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[date_filter]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
```
[store_sales_revenue]:
```sql
SELECT ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue FROM store_sales JOIN date_filter ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.38 AND 0.48 GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
```

```

```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('TN', 'TX', 'VA')
```
[filtered_item]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 AND 36
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, i_item_desc, sc.revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM store_avg_revenue AS sb JOIN store_sales_revenue AS sc ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk JOIN filtered_store AS s ON sc.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_item AS i ON sc.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk WHERE sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave ORDER BY s_store_name, i_item_desc LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}

    },

  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
