You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes inventory variability, comparing coefficient of variation between consecutive months (May vs June 2002) for Sports/Shoes items managed by specific managers. The business intent is to identify items with high inventory volatility. JOIN semantics are INNER throughout—all dimension tables must match the fact table, and the self-join requires matching warehouse and item. Aggregation trap: STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 values per group; NULL groups are filtered out by CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN NULL. Filter dependencies: The cov>1 filter in CTE must be applied BEFORE the self-join; the d_moy=5/6 filters in main query are independent per side.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CTE materialization may block parallelism on inventory scan
- Multiple CTEs increase planning time

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTE prevents parallel table scan on inventory
   RULE: Use LATERAL or subquery instead of CTE for fact table scan when parallel execution is needed
2. UNION ALL over-splitting (observed 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL when PostgreSQL's bitmap scan handles it better
   RULE: Do NOT convert OR to UNION ALL—this query has no OR conditions requiring split

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output 10 columns in exact order: inv1.w_warehouse_sk, inv1.i_item_sk, inv1.d_moy, inv1.mean, inv1.cov, inv2.w_warehouse_sk, inv2.i_item_sk, inv2.d_moy, inv2.mean, inv2.cov
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov for downstream self-join and SELECT
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: 2002, 'Shoes','Sports', 42, 61, 791, 991, 5, 1, 1.5 (second query)
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows—cov>1 filter in CTE and month filters in main query are critical
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTE uses comma-separated joins (inventory, item, warehouse, date_dim)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: CTE contains all months, filtered late in main query (d_moy=5/6)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of all 3 dimensions into CTEs with explicit JOIN syntax; ignore the UNION ALL aspect (not needed)
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date_dim isolation into CTE and explicit JOINs; ignore the single-dimension focus—we need all 3 dimensions
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early dimension filtering; ignore decorrelation aspect (no correlated subqueries)

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] inv  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K
│   ├── SCAN (inventory, item, warehouse, date_dim)
│   ├── FILTER (CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN 0 ELSE stdev / mean END > 1)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, cov)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (inv AS inv1 (join), inv AS inv2 (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── FILTER (inv1.d_moy = 5)
    ├── FILTER (inv2.d_moy = 5 + 1)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (inv1.w_warehouse_sk ASC, inv1.i_item_sk ASC, inv1.d_moy ASC, inv1.mean ASC, inv1.cov ASC, inv2.d_moy ASC, inv2.mean ASC, inv2.cov ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
