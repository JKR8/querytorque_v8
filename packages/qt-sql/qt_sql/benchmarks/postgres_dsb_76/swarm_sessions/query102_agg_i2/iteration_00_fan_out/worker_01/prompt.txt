You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare customer demographics for items sold through both store and web channels within 30 days, where inventory stock meets sales quantity. All joins are INNER (must match all sides). Aggregation is simple COUNT(*) with GROUP BY on 4 demographic columns - no sensitive aggregates. Filter dependencies: d2 date range depends on d1 date; inventory quantity check depends on store_sales quantity; state filter applies to customer_address.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Creating CTEs for large fact tables may block parallel execution of web_sales scan.
- Must ensure date_range CTE correctly correlates d1 and d2 dates.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in heavy aggregation queries):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of large fact tables.
   RULE: For web_sales/store_sales scans, avoid wrapping entire fact tables in CTEs if they benefit from parallel scans.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, hd_vehicle_count, cnt exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk, ss_quantity, ws_item_sk, ws_bill_customer_sk, etc.).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all filter values (1998, AR/CA/KS/NY/VA, 76-96, etc.).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (EXPLAIN shows optimizer using hash/nested loops but may misestimate).
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: inv_quantity_on_hand >= ss_quantity applied late after joins (EXPLAIN shows Filter on inventory scan).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: store_sales scanned repeatedly via nested loop (EXPLAIN shows 4,148 loops × 3 workers).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the staged reduction pattern: create CTEs for filtered dimensions (item, customer with demographics) and filtered facts (web_sales, store_sales) before the complex joins. Ignore that example Q072 had a different non-equi join structure - the principle of reducing both sides before inequality applies.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
