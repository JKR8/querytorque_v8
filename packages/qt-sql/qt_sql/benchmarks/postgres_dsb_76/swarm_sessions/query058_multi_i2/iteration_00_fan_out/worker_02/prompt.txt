You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares per-item revenue across three sales channels (store, catalog, web) for customers born 1985-1991, focusing on items with list price 168-197 and manager_id 42-71 during the same month as 2001-06-06. It returns items where all three channel revenues are within 10% of each other. JOIN semantics are INNER: all three CTEs must match on (item_id, birth_year). Aggregates are SUMs, safe for restructuring. The date subquery depends on outer date_dim; breaking this correlation must preserve the set of dates for that month_seq.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
month_seq_cte -> date_list_cte -> ss_items -> cs_items -> ws_items -> main_query
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  month_seq_cte:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date = '2001-06-06'
    OUTPUT: d_month_seq
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: date_list_cte
  date_list_cte:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_month_seq = (SELECT d_month_seq FROM month_seq_cte)
    OUTPUT: d_date_sk, d_date

    CONSUMERS: ss_items, cs_items, ws_items
  ss_items:

    JOIN: INNER JOIN date_list_cte ON ss_sold_date_sk = date_list_cte.d_date_sk
           INNER JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
           INNER JOIN customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
      AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991
    GROUP BY: i_item_id, c_birth_year
    AGGREGATE: SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev

  date_list_cte:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_month_seq = (SELECT d_month_seq FROM month_seq_cte)
    OUTPUT: d_date_sk, d_date
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 30

    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
      AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991
    GROUP BY: i_item_id, c_birth_year
    AGGREGATE: SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    OUTPUT: i_item_id AS item_id, c_birth_year AS birth_year, ss_item_rev

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must use AS MATERIALIZED on CTEs to prevent optimizer from re-correlating.
- The date subquery is already decorrelated by optimizer; this may yield marginal gains.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches prevented bitmap index combination.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions in this query—there are no OR conditions.
2. EXISTS to IN (observed 0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN changed join type and blocked hash anti-join.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS—this query has no EXISTS.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 9 columns (item_id, birth_year, ss_item_rev, ss_dev, cs_item_rev, cs_dev, ws_item_rev, ws_dev, average) in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Dimension CTEs must output i_item_sk, i_item_id, c_customer_sk, c_birth_year, d_date_sk, d_date for downstream fact joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep all literal values: '2001-06-06', 168, 197, 42, 71, 1985, 1991, 0.9, 1.1.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows must be identical to original.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTEs use comma-separated joins, causing poor cardinality estimation (EXPLAIN shows sequential scans on date_dim).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Date subquery is correlated; EXPLAIN shows hash semi-join but still scans date_dim twice per CTE.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same dimension filters repeated across three CTEs (EXPLAIN shows 3× scans of item and customer).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

inline_decorrelate_materialized: Apply MATERIALIZED to month_seq_cte and date_list_cte to prevent inlining and ensure decorrelation; ignore the third CTE (per-key aggregate) not needed here.
  early_filter_decorrelate: Push date filter into date_list_cte; ignore the threshold pre-computation (not present).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk

          and cs_list_price between 16 and 45
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)

    JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'

    JOIN filtered_items fi ON fi.i_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
    WHERE dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 16 AND 45
      AND dfs.cs_sales_price / dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01

JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
