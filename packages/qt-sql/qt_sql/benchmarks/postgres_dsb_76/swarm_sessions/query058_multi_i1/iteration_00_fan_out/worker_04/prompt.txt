You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares revenue performance across three sales channels (store, catalog, web) for items sold in May 1998, filtered by list price (242-271), manager ID (71-100), and customer birth years (1945-1951). All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregates are SUM only, which are duplicate-safe. The final join requires revenue values from all three channels to be within 10% of each other (6 pairwise range checks). The date filter uses a correlated subquery to find all dates in the same month as 1998-05-19.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must handle different customer key columns (ss_customer_sk vs cs_bill_customer_sk vs ws_bill_customer_sk) in UNION ALL.
  - Pivot with MAX assumes exactly one row per (item_id, birth_year, channel) group, which aggregation guarantees.
  - May lose parallel execution benefits if UNION ALL prevents index usage.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines union_consolidation + star_join_prefetch + pivot)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION (observed 0.21x regression on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches when PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN already handles them efficiently.
   RULE: Do NOT convert OR conditions to UNION ALL in this query; no OR conditions present.
2. EXISTS to IN materialization (observed 0.50x regression on Q069):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN with materialized CTEs when PostgreSQL's semi-join optimization already handles EXISTS efficiently.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS patterns; this query uses IN subqueries, not EXISTS.
3. CTE blocking parallelism (observed timeout):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs that prevent parallel execution of fact table scans.
   RULE: Use AS MATERIALIZED only when necessary for decorrelation; otherwise let optimizer inline.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs 9 columns derived from three CTEs; all must be preserved.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output item_id, birth_year, and revenue column for downstream joins and calculations.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (dates, prices, IDs, birth years) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must match original row-for-row with same ordering.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: EXPLAIN shows comma-separated joins in all three CTEs; PostgreSQL's optimizer gets poor cardinality estimates.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Date subquery is correlated and re-executed per CTE.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same dimension filters applied independently across three CTEs, causing repeated scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Apply UNION ALL consolidation of three fact tables with channel discriminator; aggregate once with GROUP BY item_id, birth_year, channel; ignore CASE/FILTER inside aggregates (we'll pivot after).
  scan_consolidation_pivot: Apply pivot using MAX(CASE) after aggregation; ensure GROUP BY includes discriminator (channel) in first aggregation step.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
