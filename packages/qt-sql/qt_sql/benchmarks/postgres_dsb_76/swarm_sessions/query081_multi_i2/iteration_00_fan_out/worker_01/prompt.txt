You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query finds Ohio customers whose total 2002 catalog returns (at their returning address state) exceed 120% of the average returns for that returning state. All joins are INNER: catalog_returns must match date_dim (2002) and returning customer_address; the aggregated CTE must match customer and current customer_address (Ohio). The aggregates SUM and AVG are duplicate-sensitive but safe because joins preserve 1:1 cardinality on grouping keys. The current address filter (ca_state = 'OH') depends on customer_address re-join, not the CTE's returning address state.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must use AS MATERIALIZED on CTEs to prevent PostgreSQL from inlining back to correlated form
- Returning address vs current address distinction critical: don't filter returning_addr_cte by 'OH'

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 16 columns from original SELECT in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include cr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state, cr_return_amt_inc_tax (for SUM), plus any join keys for downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2002, multiplier 1.2, state 'OH'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must match original exactly.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Correlated subquery at lines 19-21 causes per-state re-execution.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Implicit comma joins at lines 5-7 and 16-18 hinder cardinality estimation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- Apply: Decompose correlated subquery into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs: date filter, fact aggregation, state averages
- Ignore: The example's dimension pre-filtering - we keep returning_addr_cte unfiltered

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
                             cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 16 and 45
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
```sql
WITH filtered_items AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manufact_id IN (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)

    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
),

    SELECT dfs.cs_item_sk,
           1.3 * avg(dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
    FROM date_filtered_sales dfs
    JOIN filtered_items fi ON fi.i_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
    WHERE dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 16 AND 45
      AND dfs.cs_sales_price / dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
    GROUP BY dfs.cs_item_sk
)
SELECT sum(dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM date_filtered_sales dfs
JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

       and ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
       and ca_state = 'OH'
       and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 order by c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
