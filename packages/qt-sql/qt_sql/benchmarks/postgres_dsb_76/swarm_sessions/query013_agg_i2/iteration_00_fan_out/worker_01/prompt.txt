You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query computes average and sum metrics for store sales in the year 2001, filtered by two independent sets of OR conditions: (1) customer/household demographics with specific marital/education status, sales price ranges, and dependent counts; (2) customer address with specific US states and net profit ranges. All joins are INNER intersections requiring matches across all six tables. Aggregates are standard AVG and SUM over the entire filtered row set; no FILTER clauses or grouping-sensitive functions (STDDEV_SAMP) exist. The OR conditions are interdependent within each set but independent across sets—a row must satisfy at least one branch from each set.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CTE materialization may prevent parallel execution of the fact table scan.
- The WHERE clause in filtered_fact contains OR conditions that may still cause inefficient filtering; ensure they are applied after joins to reduce rows.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR split into UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions on indexed columns disabled PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN, forcing separate scans that increased I/O.
   RULE: Avoid splitting OR conditions that are on single-table indexed columns; this query's ORs span multiple tables, so risk is different but still present.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs four aggregate columns; any rewrite must preserve exactly these four columns in the same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must output all columns referenced by downstream joins or aggregates (e.g., ss_store_sk, ss_hdemo_sk, ss_cdemo_sk, ss_addr_sk, plus aggregated columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All literal values (2001, 'M', '2 yr Degree', 100.00, 150.00, 'United States', 'GA', etc.) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The result set must be identical to the original query's single row of four aggregates.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: The query uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows the optimizer may misestimate cardinalities due to this syntax.
- OR_CONDITION_SPLIT_RISK: The OR conditions span multiple tables; splitting them into UNION ALL may disable bitmap optimizations (see regression warning).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply the pattern of pre-filtering all dimension tables into CTEs and using explicit JOINs. Ignore that the example is for UNION queries—this query has no UNION.
  pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply the combination of date CTE and explicit JOIN syntax. Ignore that the example only isolates date_dim; we will isolate all dimensions.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~168K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2001)
    └── OUTPUT (AVG(ss_quantity), AVG(ss_ext_sales_price), AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost), SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
