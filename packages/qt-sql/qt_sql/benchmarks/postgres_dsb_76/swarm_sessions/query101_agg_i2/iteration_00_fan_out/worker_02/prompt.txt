You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query finds customers who made store purchases and returns, then web purchases within 90 days, for items in specific categories, with specific discount ranges, living in certain states and demographic bands. It counts qualifying transaction combinations per customer. All joins are INNER (must match all sides). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is sensitive to row duplication from joins. The date range filter (d2 between d1 and d1+90) creates a temporal dependency between store returns and web sales.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Moving customer filters late may increase intermediate aggregation size if state/demographic filters are very selective
- Must ensure customer join doesn't introduce duplicates (one-to-one on c_customer_sk)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression: 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs executed single-threaded prevent parallel table scans
   RULE: Use non-materialized CTEs or inline subqueries for large fact tables when parallel scans are beneficial
2. Nestloop disable on lookups (observed regression: 184x):
   CAUSE: SET enable_nestloop=off forces hash/merge joins on selective index lookups
   RULE: Never disable nestloop globally; allow optimizer to choose for point lookups

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include columns referenced downstream: ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, ws_bill_customer_sk, ws_item_sk, plus dimension keys
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact filter values: i_category IN ('Children','Home','Women'), ca_state IN ('AR','GA','IN','KY','VA'), d_year=2000, etc.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (evidence from original SQL)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Range join d2.d_date BETWEEN d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + interval '90 day')

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early filtering of fact tables before joining with dimensions; decorate with dimension attributes at the end. Ignore decorrelation aspect (no subqueries).
- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Use dimension CTEs but only for date and item; defer customer-related dimensions. Adapt by moving customer/ca/hd filters to late decoration.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
