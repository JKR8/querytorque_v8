You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count distinct customer-date combinations present in store_sales but absent from both catalog_sales and web_sales, for customers born 1968-1974 during months 1213-1224, with list price 168-197 and wholesale cost 76-86 across all channels. INNER JOIN semantics require all three tables to match in each branch. No aggregation traps (only COUNT(*)). Filter dependencies: d_month_seq and c_birth_year filters apply identically to all three branches; price/wholesale_cost filters are channel-specific but same numeric ranges.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- May not improve performance significantly (optimizer might already handle implicit joins)
- But tests COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS hypothesis directly
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: constraint_relaxation (testing if comma join conversion alone provides benefit without other structural changes)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS restructuring (observed 0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXCEPT to NOT EXISTS changed NULL semantics and blocked hash anti-joins
   RULE: Preserve EXCEPT structure; do not convert to NOT EXISTS/NOT IN
2. CTE blocking parallelism (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs forced single-threaded execution on parallelizable fact scans
   RULE: Use non-materialized CTEs or ensure parallel-safe structure when fact tables are large
3. OR to UNION ALL splitting (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches lost bitmap index scan optimization
   RULE: Do not split channel-specific filters into UNION ALL; preserve per-branch structure

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output COUNT(*) as single column
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date for EXCEPT operations
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All numeric ranges (1213-1224, 168-197, 1968-1974, 76-86) must be preserved exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: EXCEPT semantics must be preserved (set difference, not anti-join with duplicates)
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: All three branches use comma-separated implicit joins (store_sales, date_dim, customer)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim and customer filters applied three times independently

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply explicit JOIN conversion only (no CTE). Ignore date CTE isolation.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply explicit JOIN syntax improvement. Ignore early filtering and decorrelation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

and cs_warehouse_sk   = w_warehouse_sk
and cs_ship_mode_sk   = sm_ship_mode_sk
and cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk

and sm_type = 'REGULAR'
and cc_class = 'small'
and w_gmt_offset = -5

   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1193 AND 1216
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name, SUM(CASE WHEN (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "30 days", ... FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk JOIN ship_mode ON cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk JOIN call_center ON cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 271 AND 300 AND sm_type = 'REGULAR' AND cc_class = 'small' AND w_gmt_offset = -5 GROUP BY SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 99%  Rows: ~55K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11)
    ├── FILTER (ws_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197)
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
