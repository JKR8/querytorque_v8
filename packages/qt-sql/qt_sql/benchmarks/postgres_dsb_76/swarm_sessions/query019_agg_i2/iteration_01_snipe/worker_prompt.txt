You are a senior SQL optimization architect for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). You have FULL FREEDOM to design your own approach — you are NOT constrained to any specific logical tree topology or CTE structure. Your job: diagnose WHY previous workers failed to reach 2.0x, identify unexplored optimization angles, and produce an optimized SQL rewrite that reaches the target.

Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — guards prevent silent breakage. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from output.

## Target: >=2.0x speedup

Your target is >=2.0x speedup on this query. This is the bar. Anything below 2.0x is a miss.

## Previous Optimization Attempts
Target: **>=2.0x** | 4 workers tried | none reached target

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Sum sales of shoe items in February 1999 for Kansas customers born in February where customer and store zip codes differ, grouped by brand/manufacturer. Joins are all INNER (equality) requiring matches across all six tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is sensitive to row duplication from joins, but foreign-key joins preserve one-to-one mapping. The zip substring inequality filter depends on both customer_address and store tables and must be preserved.

## Bottleneck Diagnosis

Dominant cost is nested loop joins with late non-equi filter (zip substring inequality) consuming ~34% of time, followed by fact table scan with wholesale cost filter (~28%). The plan is join-bound due to many nested loops (13167, 1299 loops) despite fast index lookups. Cardinality drops sharply at date (9 rows) and wholesale cost filter (4,465 rows per loop), but dimension filters (item category, customer birth month, address state) have low selectivity (0.1 rows per loop). Optimizer already pushes predicates to index scans and uses parallel aggregation effectively. Logical-tree cost percentages misleading as nested loop overhead dominates.

## Engine Profile

*This is field intelligence gathered from 53 DSB queries at SF5-SF10. PostgreSQL is a fundamentally different optimizer than DuckDB — it has bitmap index scans, JIT compilation, and aggressive CTE materialization. Techniques that work on DuckDB often regress here. Use this to guide your analysis but apply your own judgment — every query is different. Add to this knowledge if you observe something new.*

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)
- **BITMAP_OR_SCAN**: Multi-branch OR conditions on indexed columns are handled via BitmapOr — a single fact table scan with bitmap combination. Extremely efficient.
- **SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination. Stops scanning after the first match per outer row.
- **INNER_JOIN_REORDERING**: PostgreSQL freely reorders INNER JOINs based on estimated selectivity. The cost model works well for explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
- **INDEX_ONLY_SCAN**: When an index covers all requested columns, PostgreSQL reads only the index without touching the heap.
- **PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION**: PostgreSQL parallelizes large scans and aggregations across worker processes with partial aggregation finalization.
- **JIT_COMPILATION**: PostgreSQL JIT-compiles complex expressions and tuple deforming for long-running queries.

### Optimizer Gaps (opportunities)
- **COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS**: Implicit comma-separated FROM tables (FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.id = t2.id) are treated as cross products initially. The cost model is significantly weaker on comma-joins than on explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  Opportunity: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. This alone can unlock 2-3x improvements. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
    + Q080: 3.32x — comma-joins to explicit JOINs + date CTE on multi-channel UNION query
    + Q099: 2.28x — same pattern on star schema
    + Q054: 1.14x — JOIN conversion alone
- **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS**: Cannot automatically decorrelate complex correlated subqueries. Correlated scalar subqueries with aggregates are executed as nested-loop with repeated evaluation.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
    + Q092: 4428x — timeout recovery. Unbounded correlated subquery converted to explicit JOIN.
    + Q032: 391x — same pattern, timeout to sub-second.
- **NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS**: Cannot pre-filter fact tables before non-equi join operations (date arithmetic, range comparisons, quantity < quantity). Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which is O(N*M).
  Opportunity: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
    + Q072: 2.68x — pre-filtered catalog_sales by wholesale_cost range before non-equi quantity comparison with inventory. Reduced nested-loop input by ~70%.
- **CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE**: PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default (multi-referenced) or by choice (AS MATERIALIZED). This creates a hard optimization fence — no predicate pushdown from outer query into CTE. This makes CTE-based strategies a double-edged sword on PG.
  Opportunity: Use materialization STRATEGICALLY: materialize when the CTE is expensive and reused multiple times. Avoid CTEs that fence off predicate pushdown for single-use cases.
    + Q065: 1.95x — strategic materialization prevented redundant fact table scan multiplication
- **CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS**: Same gap as DuckDB but WORSE on PostgreSQL because CTE materialization fence makes it more impactful. Predicates in the outer WHERE cannot propagate into materialized CTEs.
  Opportunity: Same as DuckDB: pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious — only when the CTE is clearly suboptimal.
    + Q080: 3.32x — date filter + comma-join conversion (the combo is key)

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[date_filter]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
```

```

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 4. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

### 5. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

### 6. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
                             cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 16 and 45
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
```sql
WITH filtered_items AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manufact_id IN (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
       OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 AND 54
),
date_filtered_sales AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT cs.cs_item_sk, cs.cs_ext_discount_amt,
           cs.cs_list_price, cs.cs_sales_price
    FROM catalog_sales cs
    JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
),
item_avg_discount AS MATERIALIZED (
    SELECT dfs.cs_item_sk,
           1.3 * avg(dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
    FROM date_filtered_sales dfs
    JOIN filtered_items fi ON fi.i_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
    WHERE dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 16 AND 45
      AND dfs.cs_sales_price / dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
    GROUP BY dfs.cs_item_sk
)
SELECT sum(dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM date_filtered_sales dfs
JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

## Correctness Invariants (HARD STOPS — non-negotiable)

These 4 constraints are absolute. Even with full creative freedom, you may NEVER violate these:

- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.
- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Aggregation Semantics Check (HARD STOP)

- STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — changing group membership changes the result.
- AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe.
- FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
- Verify aggregation equivalence for ANY proposed restructuring.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
  from date_dim, store_sales, item,customer,customer_address,store
  where  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND i_category  = 'Shoes'
    and d_year=1999
    and d_moy = 2
    and substring(ca_zip,1,5) <> substring(s_zip,1,5)
    and ca_state  = 'KS'
    and c_birth_month = 2
    and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
 group by i_brand
      ,i_brand_id
      ,i_manufact_id
      ,i_manufact
 order by ext_price desc
         ,i_brand
         ,i_brand_id
         ,i_manufact_id
         ,i_manufact
limit 100 ;
```

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Your Task — Self-Directed Retry

Work through these 3 steps in a `<reasoning>` block, then output your optimized SQL:

1. **DIAGNOSE**: Why did the best worker achieve 1.0475868188308057x instead of the 2.0x target? What do the EXPLAIN plans reveal about the actual execution bottleneck?
2. **IDENTIFY**: What optimization angles are still unexplored? What did the empirical results reveal that couldn't have been known before seeing the execution plans?
3. **REWRITE**: Produce optimized SQL that exploits the angles you identified. You may build on the best foundation or start fresh.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Verify output schema matches the Column Completeness Contract (same columns, same names, same order).
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Correctness Invariants` (including join/null behavior).
- Verify aggregation equivalence: same rows participate in each group, same aggregate semantics.
- Preserve all literals exactly (numbers, strings, date values).
- Apply `Hazard Flags` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `brand_id`
  2. `brand`
  3. `i_manufact_id`
  4. `i_manufact`
  5. `ext_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
