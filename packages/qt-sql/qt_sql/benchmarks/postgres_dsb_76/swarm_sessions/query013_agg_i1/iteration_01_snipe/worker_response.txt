## Explanation

**Changes**: Converted comma-joins to explicit INNER JOINs and pre-filtered dimension tables into CTEs. The `store_sales_core` CTE applies date filter and broad price/profit ranges early, reducing the fact table rows before expensive OR evaluation. The main query joins pre-filtered dimension CTEs (tiny hash tables) and applies the specific OR conditions.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x. This approach addresses PostgreSQL's comma-join weakness and reduces the nested-loop input size by filtering store_sales early with indexed conditions (date and broad ranges). The explicit joins allow better join order optimization, and pre-filtered dimension CTEs create small hash tables for efficient probing.
