**Changes**: Converted comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax and decomposed into CTE structure per logical tree. Preserved all original OR conditions verbatim.

**Expected speedup**: Minimal (0.95-1.05x). Explicit joins provide clearer semantics but same execution. CTE may be inlined by optimizer. Collapse limits increased to ensure full join reordering flexibility.
