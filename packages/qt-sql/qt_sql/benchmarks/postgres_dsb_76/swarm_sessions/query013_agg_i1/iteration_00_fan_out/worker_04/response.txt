Changes: Restructured into three-stage CTE pipeline: fact filtering first, then dimension joins with complex OR conditions, final aggregation. This follows the target logical tree exactly, pushing fact-only predicates early while keeping defensive OR logic.

Expected speedup: ~1.5-2x from reduced row processing in dimension joins; avoids UNION ALL regression risk; CTEs remain non-materialized for potential parallelism.
