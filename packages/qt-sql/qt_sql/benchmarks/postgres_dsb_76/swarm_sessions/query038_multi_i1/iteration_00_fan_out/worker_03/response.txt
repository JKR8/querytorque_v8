**Changes**: Converted INTERSECT to EXISTS semi-joins with a base CTE for store_sales, maintaining identical intersection semantics. The EXISTS subqueries re-apply all dimension filters independently (as required) and correlate only on the output triple.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.2-1.5x by replacing set operations with semi-joins while keeping dimension filters pushed down into each subquery. Merge joins preferred due to sorted nature of date_dim.d_date_sk joins.
