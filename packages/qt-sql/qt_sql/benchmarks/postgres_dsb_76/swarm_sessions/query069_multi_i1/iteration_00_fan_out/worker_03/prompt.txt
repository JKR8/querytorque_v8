You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Identify demographic segments of customers in three states who purchased in stores during Q4 2002 (list price $80-$169) but did NOT purchase via web or catalog in same period. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER equi-joins (customer-address, customer-demographics) plus EXISTS semi-join and NOT EXISTS anti-joins correlated by customer_sk. Aggregation trap: Three COUNT(*) are identical per group (no FILTER clause). Filter dependencies: The date range (2002, months 10-12) and list price range (80-169) must apply identically across all three channel subqueries.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_date -> multi_channel_scan -> customer_base -> filtered_join -> group_by
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_date:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_year = 2002 AND d_moy BETWEEN 10 AND 12
    OUTPUT: d_date_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 31
    CONSUMERS: multi_channel_scan
  multi_channel_scan:
    FROM: 
      (SELECT ss_customer_sk, 'store' AS channel FROM store_sales WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
      UNION ALL
      (SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk, 'web' FROM web_sales WHERE ws_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
      UNION ALL
      (SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk, 'catalog' FROM catalog_sales WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
    JOIN filtered_date ON (store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk OR web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk OR catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk) -- This is problematic. Better: join each branch separately.
    Actually, let's restructure: create three CTEs that join with filtered_date, then union.
  Let's redesign: Use three CTEs that join with filtered_date, then combine into a single customer-channel table.
  But we need to keep the date join efficient. Instead, do:
  store_sales_filtered:
    FROM: store_sales JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169
    OUTPUT: ss_customer_sk, 'store' AS channel
  web_sales_filtered: similar
  catalog_sales_filtered: similar
  Then union all into channel_activity.
  However, we still have three separate scans. But we can at least share the date CTE.
  So:
  filtered_date -> store_sales_filtered, web_sales_filtered, catalog_sales_filtered -> channel_activity CTE.
  Then pivot channel_activity to check conditions per customer.
  This is getting complex. Let's stick with sharing date CTE but keep channel scans separate.
  So:
  filtered_date (shared) -> store_sales_cte, web_sales_cte, catalog_sales_cte (as in Worker 1).
  Then same as Worker 1.
  That's essentially Worker 1 with explicit date CTE.
  But we want structural diversity. Let's instead try to consolidate the three fact scans into a single derived table that uses UNION ALL and then aggregate per customer to compute which channels they have.
  Let's design:
  filtered_date -> all_sales_union -> customer_channel_flags -> customer_base -> filter_flags -> group_by.
  So:
  all_sales_union:
    FROM: 
      (SELECT ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk, 'store' AS channel FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
      UNION ALL
      (SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk, 'web' FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_date ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE ws_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
      UNION ALL
      (SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk, 'catalog' FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169)
    OUTPUT: customer_sk, channel
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 151K+84K+332K = 567K
    CONSUMERS: customer_channel_flags
  customer_channel_flags:
    FROM: all_sales_union
    GROUP BY: customer_sk
    AGGREGATE: 
        BOOL_OR(channel = 'store') AS has_store,
        BOOL_OR(channel = 'web') AS has_web,
        BOOL_OR(channel = 'catalog') AS has_catalog
    OUTPUT: customer_sk, has_store, has_web, has_catalog
    EXPECTED_ROWS: number of distinct customers across all sales (<= 567K)
    CONSUMERS: filter_flags
  Then join with customer_base and filter: has_store = true AND has_web = false AND has_catalog = false.
  This consolidates three fact scans into one pass each but via UNION ALL. However, it still scans each fact table once. The win is reducing date_dim scans to one and maybe enabling hash aggregation.
  Let's proceed with this design.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL may increase temp space (567K rows). The per-customer aggregation could be expensive if many distinct customers.
- The MAX(CASE) aggregation must produce correct flags; ensure no duplicate customer_sk per channel? Actually a customer could have multiple sales in same channel, but flag is still 1.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS to IN/NOT IN materializing CTEs (observed regression 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to NOT IN with CTEs blocked hash anti-join optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT convert NOT EXISTS to NOT IN; keep anti-join structure but decorrelate via precomputed sets and LEFT JOIN / IS NULL.
2. Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's bitmap OR scan is more efficient.
   RULE: Not applicable; query has no OR conditions on indexed columns.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3 in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: customer_sk, address_sk, demo_sk, ca_state, cd_* columns, etc.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: ca_state IN ('CO','NC','TX'), cd_marital_status IN ('S','M','U'), cd_education_status IN ('Primary','College'), d_year=2002, d_moy between 10 and 12, list_price between 80 and 169.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows as original with same grouping counts.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins in main FROM and subqueries, confusing cardinality estimation.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS cause nested-loop anti-joins with per-row materialization.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim filter scanned three times separately.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_self_join_decomposition: Apply materialization of shared date filter into CTE and reuse across channel scans. Ignore the fact that example reuses same fact table; we have different fact tables.
- single_pass_aggregation: Use UNION ALL to consolidate channel scans and aggregate per customer to compute channel flags. Ignore the CASE/FILTER inside aggregates; we use MAX(CASE).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
