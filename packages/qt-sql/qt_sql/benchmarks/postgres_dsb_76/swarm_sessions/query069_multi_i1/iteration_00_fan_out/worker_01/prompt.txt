You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Identify demographic segments of customers in three states who purchased in stores during Q4 2002 (list price $80-$169) but did NOT purchase via web or catalog in same period. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER equi-joins (customer-address, customer-demographics) plus EXISTS semi-join and NOT EXISTS anti-joins correlated by customer_sk. Aggregation trap: Three COUNT(*) are identical per group (no FILTER clause). Filter dependencies: The date range (2002, months 10-12) and list price range (80-169) must apply identically across all three channel subqueries.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Converting NOT EXISTS to LEFT JOIN/IS NULL may change NULL handling if ws_bill_customer_sk can be NULL (unlikely in fact table).
- CTEs may be inlined unless MATERIALIZED is used, losing materialization benefit.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS to IN/NOT IN materializing CTEs (observed regression 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to NOT IN with CTEs blocked hash anti-join optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT convert NOT EXISTS to NOT IN; keep anti-join structure but decorrelate via precomputed sets and LEFT JOIN / IS NULL.
2. Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's bitmap OR scan is more efficient.
   RULE: Not applicable; query has no OR conditions on indexed columns.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3 in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: customer_sk, address_sk, demo_sk, ca_state, cd_* columns, etc.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: ca_state IN ('CO','NC','TX'), cd_marital_status IN ('S','M','U'), cd_education_status IN ('Primary','College'), d_year=2002, d_moy between 10 and 12, list_price between 80 and 169.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows as original with same grouping counts.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins in main FROM and subqueries, confusing cardinality estimation.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS cause nested-loop anti-joins with per-row materialization.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim filter scanned three times separately.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of customer_address and customer_demographics into CTEs and convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax. Ignore the promotion/item dimensions; our query has different dimensions.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date_dim isolation into CTE and explicit joins. Ignore the fact that example also converts fact joins; we keep fact tables in separate CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~500K
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (ca_state IN ('CO', 'NC', 'TX'))
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status IN ('S', 'M', 'U'))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_education_status ASC, cd_purchase_estimate ASC, cd_credit_rating ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
