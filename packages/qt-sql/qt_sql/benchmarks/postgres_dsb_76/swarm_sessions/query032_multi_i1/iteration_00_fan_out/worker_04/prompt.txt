You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Find catalog sales with discount amounts exceeding 130% of the average discount for that item during a 90-day period, for items from specific manufacturers or managers. JOIN semantics: INNER joins between catalog_sales↔item (on i_item_sk) and catalog_sales↔date_dim (on d_date_sk). Aggregation trap: The correlated subquery's AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) must be computed per item over the same date range but with additional price ratio filters (cs_list_price 108-137, sales/list ratio 23-43%). Filter dependencies: The date range filter ('1998-01-06' to +90 days) appears in both main query and subquery and must be applied consistently.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Mathematical correctness: Need to verify SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) > 1.3*AVG(...) is equivalent to computing excess per item as (total - 1.3*average) when there are multiple rows per item.
- Early aggregation changes group membership: Must ensure all original rows that would pass the filter are accounted for.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR-to-UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions (i_manufact_id IN... OR i_manager_id BETWEEN) into UNION ALL branches prevented bitmap OR scan optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT convert the item OR condition to UNION ALL; rely on PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN.
2. EXISTS-to-IN materialization (observed regression 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN with materialized CTEs blocked hash anti-join optimizations.
   RULE: Not applicable - query has no EXISTS.
3. CTE parallelism blocking (observed regression in heavy aggregation):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scan optimization.
   RULE: Consider SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather when creating fact table CTEs.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output single column "excess discount amount" with ORDER BY SUM(...).
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include cs_item_sk, cs_ext_discount_amt, cs_sold_date_sk, and price columns for downstream joins/filters.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact date '1998-01-06', interval '90 day', manufacturer IDs, manager range, price ranges, and ratio values.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same sum of excess discounts ordered by that sum.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Evidence: Subquery references outer i_item_sk, re-executes per row per EXPLAIN logical tree.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Evidence: Query uses FROM catalog_sales, item, date_dim (comma syntax) causing cardinality estimation issues.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Evidence: Same catalog_sales+date_dim scan appears in main query and subquery with same date filter.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- From single_pass_aggregation: Apply CASE expressions to compute qualifying average in one pass.
- From early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters early and compute thresholds separately.
- Ignore: The examples don't handle the mathematical equivalence of SUM>1.3*AVG vs computing excess directly.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER ((i_manufact_id IN (47, 226, 612, 676, 818) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 AND 100))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '1998-01-06' AND CAST('1998-01-06' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (excess discount amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
