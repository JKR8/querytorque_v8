You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes catalog sales in 1999 for specific demographics and item categories, comparing promoted vs non-promoted sales and checking inventory availability. It joins catalog_sales with inventory (matching item and date week) and multiple dimensions (date, customer, household, item, warehouse, promotion, and catalog_returns). The left join to promotion is used to distinguish promoted sales, and the left join to catalog_returns is for potential future use but does not affect the result. The non-equi join condition (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity) must be preserved. The aggregation is conditional on p_promo_sk and counts rows, so duplication from joins must be avoided.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Removing the left join to catalog_returns might change the result if there are duplicate returns (but the primary key ensures uniqueness). However, the original query includes the join, so we must be cautious.

CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: The removal of catalog_returns join is a novel exploration for this query, but we must verify semantic equivalence by ensuring that the join does not change the row count.

EXPLORATION_TYPE: constraint_relaxation (removing a join that does not affect the result)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Removing catalog_returns left join (observed in Q072):
   CAUSE: The left join is on a composite key that is unique in catalog_returns, so removal does not change row counts.
   RULE: Can remove the left join to catalog_returns if it is not used in SELECT or GROUP BY, but must verify uniqueness.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt in the same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns needed by downstream joins and the final SELECT.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All literal values (1999, '>10000', 'S', 9, 11, 'Men', 'Shoes', 'Sports', 76, 96) must be preserved.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The result must be identical to the original query.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply the pattern of pre-filtering dimensions and fact table into CTEs. Ignore the non-equi join condition handling.
- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Use the idea of pre-filtering dimensions, but also pre-filter the fact table.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  i_item_desc
      ,w_warehouse_name
      ,d1.d_week_seq
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) no_promo
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) promo
      ,count(*) total_cnt
from catalog_sales
join inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)
join warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)
join item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)

join household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)
join date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)
left outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)
left outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
where d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day'
  and hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
  and d1.d_year = 1998
  and cd_marital_status = 'M'
  and cd_dep_count between 9 and 11
  and i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
group by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq

```

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~227K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, inventory (join), warehouse (join), item (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), promotion (join), catalog_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq)
    ├── FILTER (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity)
    ├── FILTER (d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL '3 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (+6 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc ASC, w_warehouse_name ASC, d_week_seq ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
