You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes shipping performance by warehouse, ship mode, and call center, counting orders grouped by delivery time buckets (30 days, 31-60 days, etc.). All joins are INNER equi-joins (all sides must match). Aggregation uses conditional SUMs of 1/0 values based on date differences, which are grouping-insensitive. Filter dependencies: date_dim.d_month_seq range, catalog_sales.cs_list_price range, warehouse.w_gmt_offset, ship_mode.sm_type, and call_center.cc_class must be preserved exactly.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Optimizer may still choose nested loops with this structure
- No CTEs means dimension filters may still be evaluated multiple times

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression: 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel table scans.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping large fact table scans in CTEs; keep fact table in main query for parallel execution.
2. Over-aggressive join elimination (observed regression: 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: Converting nested loops to hash joins when dimension selectivity is extremely high (1-2 rows) can increase memory overhead.
   RULE: For tiny dimension tables (<10 rows), nested loops may be optimal; let optimizer choose.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs 8 columns: substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, cc_name, and 5 bucket counts.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include cs_ship_date_sk, cs_sold_date_sk for date difference calculation, plus all join keys and GROUP BY columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact filter values: d_month_seq 1192-1215, cs_list_price 86-115, sm_type 'EXPRESS', cc_class 'small', w_gmt_offset -5.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 4 aggregated rows with identical counts.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins causing nested loops (EXPLAIN: "Nested Loop Inner (rows=1 loops=4386)").
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Dimension tables scanned thousands of times (EXPLAIN: "Seq Scan on warehouse (rows=2 loops=2193)").

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply explicit JOIN syntax conversion only. Ignore the CTE isolation (we're not using CTEs).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

```

**AFTER (fast):**

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~17K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, warehouse (join), ship_mode (join), call_center (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1192 AND 1192 + 23)
    ├── FILTER (cs_list_price BETWEEN 86 AND 115)
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20) ASC, sm_type ASC, cc_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,, sm_type, cc_name, 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, >120 days)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
