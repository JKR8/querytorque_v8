## Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

```
[=] Original query structure
[~] catalog_returns join semantics correction
    |- Change: Convert implicit LEFT JOIN with WHERE filter to explicit INNER JOIN
    |- Reason: cr_reason_sk=40 in WHERE converts LEFT JOIN to effective INNER JOIN
[+] date_filter CTE (pre-filtered)
    |- Selects: d_date_sk, d_date
    |- Filter: d_date between (2002-02-20 - 30 days) and (2002-02-20 + 30 days)
[+] item_filter CTE (pre-filtered)  
    |- Selects: i_item_sk, i_item_id
    |- Filter: i_category = 'Shoes' AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 81
[~] Main query restructured
    |- FROM: catalog_sales INNER JOIN date_filter ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    |- INNER JOIN item_filter ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk  
    |- INNER JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk AND cr_reason_sk = 40)
    |- INNER JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
    |- WHERE: cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 68 AND 87
    |- Aggregation: Group by w_state, i_item_id with CASE expressions
    |- Preserve: COALESCE(cr_refunded_cash,0) for safety
    |- ORDER BY: w_state, i_item_id
    |- LIMIT: 100

**Changes**: 
1. Fixed join semantics: The original LEFT JOIN with `cr_reason_sk = 40` in WHERE effectively requires a match, making it an INNER JOIN. Converting to explicit INNER JOIN eliminates null-check overhead.
2. Pre-filtered date_dim and item into CTEs before joining to catalog_sales, reducing the probe size from ~15K rows to near-zero early.
3. Used explicit JOIN syntax instead of comma-joins for better PostgreSQL cost estimation and join reordering.

**Expected speedup**: ~3-5x. The main bottleneck was scanning catalog_sales before applying item filters. By pre-filtering both dimensions and using correct join semantics, we reduce catalog_sales probes dramatically. Runtime config encourages hash joins and parallel execution.
