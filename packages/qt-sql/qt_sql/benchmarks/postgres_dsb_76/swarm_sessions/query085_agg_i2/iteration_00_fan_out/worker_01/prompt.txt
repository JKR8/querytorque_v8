You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes refund patterns by reason description for web sales in 2002, filtering on customer demographics (three specific marital/education combinations with price ranges) and customer address (three US state groups with net profit ranges). All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches across all 8 tables. Aggregates (AVG) are duplicate-sensitive—any rewrite changing row duplication per reason group will break results. The complex OR conditions create predicate dependencies: each branch's filters must remain logically ANDed within that branch, not cross-applied.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Over-materialization: Creating CTEs for all dimensions may add overhead if they're tiny and index scans are already fast.
- Predicate duplication: The OR conditions on ws_sales_price and ws_net_profit must be preserved exactly; ensure they're not incorrectly simplified.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (0.21x regression on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches disrupted efficient bitmap index scans, causing repeated full scans.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions into UNION ALL for this query; consider CASE restructuring instead.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs substring(r_reason_desc,1,20) and three averages; must preserve exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, filter columns, group-by columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Original has specific literals: 2002, 'S', 'Primary', 100.00-150.00, etc. Must copy exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows/ordering as original with LIMIT 100.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: EXPLAIN shows nested loops with comma-separated joins; cardinality estimation may be suboptimal.
- NESTED_LOOP_TRAP: Plan uses 7 nested loops; hash joins might be faster given row counts.
- OR_CONDITION_EVALUATION: OR conditions evaluated as join filters in nested loops; but UNION ALL split caused 0.21x regression on Q085.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of selective dimensions (date, customer_demographics, customer_address, reason) into CTEs. Convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax. Ignore the multi-channel UNION aspect—this query has no UNION.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date_dim CTE isolation AND explicit JOIN syntax conversion. Ignore the single-dimension focus—this query needs multiple dimension CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~31K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, web_returns (join), web_page (join), customer_demographics AS cd1 (join), customer_demographics AS cd2 (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), reason (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+6 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2002)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc FROM 1 FOR 20) ASC, AVG(ws_quantity) ASC, AVG(wr_refunded_cash) ASC, AVG(wr_fee) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc, 1, 20, AVG(ws_quantity), AVG(wr_refunded_cash), AVG(wr_fee))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
