You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Count pairs of distinct items (item1 < item2) purchased together in the same transaction, where both items meet specific category/manager filters, the transaction occurred in 1998-1999, the customer has specific demographics, and both items' list prices are in range 108-122. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: item1.i_category filter applies only to item1, item2.i_manager_id filter applies only to item2, date filter applies to s1 only but implicitly affects s2 via same ticket number.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Need to ensure item filters (category, manager_id) are applied after self-join to avoid missing pairs
- Customer demographics filter might reduce rows before self-join, changing pair counts

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in SF-005):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of large fact tables
   RULE: For store_sales CTEs, avoid MATERIALIZED unless proven beneficial; use explicit JOINs with pre-filtered subqueries
2. Over-aggressive decorrelation (observed regression in SF-009):
   CAUSE: Converting implicit joins to explicit CTEs can prevent join reordering and predicate pushdown
   RULE: Keep dimension filters as close to base tables as possible; use subqueries not CTEs for small dimension lookups

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk, cnt
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include columns referenced by downstream joins/filters
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values (1998, 'Electronics', 'Jewelry', 81, 100, 'S', 'College', 108, 122)
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, ordering
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM item AS item1, item AS item2, store_sales AS s1...)
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: store_sales scanned twice (s1 and s2) with overlapping filters
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk joins two large intermediate results

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply: Materialize filtered store_sales+date once, then self-join for pairs
  Ignore: The example's aggregation derivation pattern; this query counts pairs not averages

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc

```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~654K
    ├── SCAN (item AS item1 (join), item AS item2 (join), store_sales AS s1 (join), store_sales AS s2 (join), date_dim (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
