You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers with high return amounts in 2002 for specific item manager IDs and return‑amount‑per‑quantity ranges, comparing each customer's total return to 1.2× their state's average, and returns detailed customer info for those in states OK, SC, TX, WI with return reasons 20 or 36 and birth years 1985‑1991. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregates are SUM and AVG, which are duplicate‑safe. The correlated subquery depends on ctr_state equality; any rewrite must preserve per‑state averaging.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk: filtered_addresses uses ca_state filter, but CTE needs returning address state, not current address state. The main query also filters on customer_address.ca_state (current address). Must keep both separate.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Splitting OR to UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN already handles OR efficiently; splitting adds overhead.
   RULE: Do not split OR conditions in this query (none present).
2. Converting EXISTS to IN (observed regression 0.50x):
   CAUSE: EXISTS uses semi‑join with early termination; IN materializes full set.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS to IN (none present).
3. Disabling nestloop (observed regression 184x):
   CAUSE: Nested loops are optimal for dimension lookups with indexes.
   RULE: Do not SET enable_nestloop=off; current plan uses nested loops for item and customer_address lookups.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 13 customer columns plus ctr_total_return in exact original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include wr_returning_customer_sk, ca_state, wr_reason_sk, and sum(wr_return_amt) as ctr_* columns, plus any join keys needed downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: d_year=2002, i_manager_id BETWEEN 68 AND 77, wr_return_amt/wr_return_quantity BETWEEN 242 AND 271, ca_state IN ('OK','SC','TX','WI'), ctr_reason_sk IN (20,36), c_birth_year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with same ordering.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXPLAIN shows subquery runs 6 times, each scanning CTE (99 rows). Evidence: "Aggregate (rows=1 loops=6)" under CTE Scan ctr2.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTE uses comma‑separated joins (web_returns, date_dim, customer_address, item). Evidence: logical tree shows implicit joins.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: CTE scanned 7 times total (1 for ctr1, 6 for subquery). Evidence: CTE Scan ctr1 (rows=99) and CTE Scan ctr2 (rows=4 loops=6).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- inline_decorrelate_materialized: Apply the 3‑CTE decomposition (dimension filter, fact filter, per‑key aggregate) to compute state averages separately. IGNORE the fact‑filter CTE because our fact filter (wr_return_amt/quantity) is already in web_returns_join.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters (date, item, address) into separate CTEs before joining. IGNORE the threshold‑pre‑compute aspect (we do that in state_avg).
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Convert comma joins to explicit JOINs and isolate date filter into a CTE. Apply to all dimensions (date, item, address).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk

          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01

JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 3. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
