**Changes**: Materialized the base fact+dimension scan into `base_cte`, computed per-state thresholds in `state_avg_cte`, and replaced the correlated subquery with a JOIN to eliminate repeated CTE scanning (7 scans → 2).  
**Expected speedup**: ~3.5x (eliminates 6 correlated subquery executions while preserving all semantics and defensive guards).
