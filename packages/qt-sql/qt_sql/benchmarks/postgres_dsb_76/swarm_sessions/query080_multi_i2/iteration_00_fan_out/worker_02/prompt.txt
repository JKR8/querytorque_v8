You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query computes sales, returns, and profit for three sales channels (store, catalog, web) over a 30-day period, filtered to high-priced items in specific categories sold via email promotions. Each channel's results are aggregated by location (store, catalog page, website). JOIN semantics: fact tables INNER JOIN dimension tables (date_dim, store, item, promotion) and LEFT JOIN returns tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: date range, item price/category, promotion channels, and wholesale_cost range must be preserved across all three channels.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex ON condition for returns join across channels with different keys.
- Risk of incorrect Cartesian product in shared_dims if not properly joined.
- May lose parallel execution on fact tables if wrapped in complex UNION subquery.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in other queries):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of fact tables.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping large fact table scans in MATERIALIZED CTEs; keep fact scans in main query body with explicit joins.
2. Over-aggressive dimension prefetch (observed regression in Q21):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering small dimension into CTE omitted join columns needed downstream.
   RULE: Ensure dimension CTEs include all join keys (e.g., item_sk, promo_sk) and any columns used in GROUP BY or SELECT.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs channel, id, sales, returns, profit with ROLLUP.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream UNION and main query.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '1999-10-21', price 50, categories 'Men','Music', promotion channel values exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, ordering as original.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Original uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows optimizer converts but cardinality estimation may suffer.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same dimension filters (date, item, promotion) applied three times independently.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply the concept of sharing dimension filters across channels via a common CTE. Ignore the specific fact table consolidation pattern; we adapt by creating a shared_dims CTE then joining each fact table separately (not fully consolidated union).

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
