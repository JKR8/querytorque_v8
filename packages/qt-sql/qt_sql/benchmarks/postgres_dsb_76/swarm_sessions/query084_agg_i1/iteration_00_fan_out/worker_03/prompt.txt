You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query finds customers in Jackson city within a specific income band who have store returns. Business intent: identify customers for targeted marketing based on geography, income, and return behavior. All joins are INNER (must match all sides). No aggregation traps. Filter dependencies: customer_address.city filter must remain joined to customer via address_sk; income_band range filter must remain joined to household_demographics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_core -> store_returns -> customer_demographics_lookup -> main
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_core:
    FROM: customer
    JOIN: INNER JOIN customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
          INNER JOIN household_demographics ON customer.c_current_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
          INNER JOIN income_band ON household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk = income_band.ib_income_band_sk
    WHERE: customer_address.ca_city = 'Jackson' 
           AND income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 23567 AND income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 73567
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, c_current_cdemo_sk, (all columns needed for downstream)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~12
    CONSUMERS: store_returns_join
  store_returns_join:
    FROM: filtered_core
    JOIN: INNER JOIN store_returns ON store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk = filtered_core.c_current_cdemo_sk
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~44
    CONSUMERS: customer_demographics_lookup
  customer_demographics_lookup:
    FROM: store_returns_join
    JOIN: INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON store_returns_join.sr_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, customername (coalesce concatenation)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~100 (after limit)
    CONSUMERS: main

NODE_CONTRACTS:
filtered_core:
    FROM: customer
    JOIN: INNER JOIN customer_address ON customer.c_current_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
          INNER JOIN household_demographics ON customer.c_current_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
          INNER JOIN income_band ON household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk = income_band.ib_income_band_sk
    WHERE: customer_address.ca_city = 'Jackson' 
           AND income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 23567 AND income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 73567
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, c_current_cdemo_sk, (all columns needed for downstream)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~12
    CONSUMERS: store_returns_join
  store_returns_join:
    FROM: filtered_core
    JOIN: INNER JOIN store_returns ON store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk = filtered_core.c_current_cdemo_sk
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~44
    CONSUMERS: customer_demographics_lookup
  customer_demographics_lookup:
    FROM: store_returns_join
    JOIN: INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON store_returns_join.sr_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, customername (coalesce concatenation)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~100 (after limit)
    CONSUMERS: main

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must verify customer_demographics join isn't needed earlier for filtering (it's not).
- store_returns join uses sr_cdemo_sk which comes from customer_demographics, but we're joining store_returns before customer_demographics. Actually store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk references customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk, so we need customer_demographics to join to store_returns. Strategy revision: join customer_demographics earlier, but skip household_demographics if possible? Wait, household_demographics is needed for income_band filter. Revised: filtered_core includes customer+customer_address+household_demographics+income_band, then join to customer_demographics, then store_returns.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT - Must output c_customer_id and customername exactly as defined.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS - Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: address_sk, demo_sk, hdemo_sk, income_band_sk, etc.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION - Must preserve 'Jackson', 23567, 50000 literals.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE - Must return same 100 rows in same order.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS - Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (FROM customer, customer_address, ...). EXPLAIN shows optimizer reorders joins but explicit JOINs with pre-filtered CTEs may improve cardinality estimation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

dimension_cte_isolate: Apply filtering of core dimensions (customer_address, income_band) early. Ignore CTE materialization if not beneficial.
late_attribute_binding: Defer customer_demographics join until after store_returns join, since customer_demographics columns aren't used in filters or SELECT (only join key). This is the core adaptation.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  'Jackson'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  23567
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  23567 + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 limit 100;
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~500K
    ├── SCAN (customer, customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), income_band (join), store_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (ca_city = 'Jackson')
    ├── FILTER (ib_lower_bound >= 23567)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (c_customer_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customername)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
