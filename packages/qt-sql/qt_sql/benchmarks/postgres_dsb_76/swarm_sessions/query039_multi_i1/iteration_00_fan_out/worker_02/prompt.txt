You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares inventory volatility (coefficient of variation) between February and March 2002 for the same warehouse/item combinations in Jewelry and Men categories. The self-join is an INNER join requiring matches on both warehouse and item keys across months. STDDEV_SAMP requires per-month grouping - changing group membership breaks statistical correctness. The covariance filter (>1) depends on aggregates computed in the CTE and cannot be pushed below GROUP BY.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Base scan computes ALL months, but we filter to months 2,3 in CTEs - this reduces downstream processing
- Must maintain covariance filter (>1) in month CTEs, not in base scan

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 10 output columns in original order
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Downstream self-join references w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep exact literals: 2002, 'Jewelry', 'Men', 81, 100, 0, 200, 2, 2+1, 1, 1.5
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Self-join must match same warehouse/item across months 2 and 3 only
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTE uses comma-separated implicit joins (lines 6-9)
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: CTE computes all months, filters month=2/3 only in main query

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_self_join_decomposition: Apply the pattern of materializing base fact+dimension scan once and deriving month-specific aggregates from it; ignore the store vs item aspect - we have warehouse/item grouping.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
```

```sql

```

```sql
SELECT ss_store_sk, AVG(revenue) AS ave FROM store_sales_revenue GROUP BY ss_store_sk
```

```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('TN', 'TX', 'VA')
```

```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 AND 36
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, i_item_desc, sc.revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM store_avg_revenue AS sb JOIN store_sales_revenue AS sc ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk JOIN filtered_store AS s ON sc.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_item AS i ON sc.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk WHERE sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave ORDER BY s_store_name, i_item_desc LIMIT 100

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

│   ├── FILTER (CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN 0 ELSE stdev / mean END > 1)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
