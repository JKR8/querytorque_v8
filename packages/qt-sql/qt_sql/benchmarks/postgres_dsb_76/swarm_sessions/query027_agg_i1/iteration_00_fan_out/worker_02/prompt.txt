You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute average sales metrics for sports items sold in Iowa stores in 2002 to female, married, primary‑education customers, broken down by item and state with rollup subtotals. All joins are INNER (equality on foreign keys). AVG aggregates are duplicate‑sensitive but grouping‑insensitive; any rewrite must preserve the exact set of store_sales rows contributing to each (i_item_id, s_state) group. The s_state=‘IA’ and i_category=‘Sports’ filters are independent of other dimensions and must remain applied to their respective tables.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
joined → aggregated → sorted_limited
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  joined:
    FROM: store_sales
         INNER JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
         INNER JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
         INNER JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
         INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    WHERE: cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Primary'
           AND d_year = 2002 AND s_state = 'IA' AND i_category = 'Sports'
    OUTPUT: i_item_id, s_state, ss_quantity, ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_sales_price

    OUTPUT: i_item_id, s_state, GROUPING(s_state) AS g_state, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ≤100
    CONSUMERS: sorted_limited
  sorted_limited:

         INNER JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
         INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    WHERE: cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Primary'
           AND d_year = 2002 AND s_state = 'IA' AND i_category = 'Sports'

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Minimal change; may not improve over optimizer's already good predicate pushdown.
- Explicit JOIN order may differ from optimizer's chosen order.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, s_state, g_state, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4 in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: join keys (ss_sold_date_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, ss_cdemo_sk) and grouping columns (i_item_id, s_state).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literals: 'F', 'M', 'Primary', 2002, 'IA', 'Sports'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, grouping, and ordering.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma‑separated joins; EXPLAIN shows nested‑loop plan that may benefit from explicit JOINs with pre‑filtered CTEs.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply predicate pushdown into JOIN ON clauses or WHERE; ignore decorrelation (no subqueries).
- pushdown: Push filters directly into JOIN conditions; ignore the CTE aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~37K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), store (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status = 'M')
    ├── FILTER (+4 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC, s_state ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, s_state, g_state, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
