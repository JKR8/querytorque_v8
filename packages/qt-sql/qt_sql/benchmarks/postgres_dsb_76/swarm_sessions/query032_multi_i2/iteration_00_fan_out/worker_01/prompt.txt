You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find the total excess discount amount where catalog sales discounts exceed 130% of the average discount for that item during a 90-day period, but only for items from specific manufacturers or with managers in a specific range. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). The AVG in the correlated subquery is sensitive to row duplication from joins; any restructuring must preserve the exact set of rows that participate in each per-item average. The outer date filter (d_date between) must apply identically to both outer query and subquery.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_dates -> filtered_items -> item_thresholds -> main_join -> final_aggregation
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_dates:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN '2001-02-23' AND CAST('2001-02-23' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY'

      LEFT JOIN item_thresholds ON cs_item_sk = item_thresholds.cs_item_sk
    WHERE: cs_ext_discount_amt > COALESCE(item_thresholds.threshold, -1) AND catalog_sales row meets outer conditions (implicit via joins)

    OUTPUT: "excess discount amount"
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: none

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must handle items with no threshold (LEFT JOIN and COALESCE). Subquery returns NULL if no rows, making comparison false.
- Ensure item_thresholds computes AVG only over rows meeting subquery filters, not outer filters.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR condition into UNION ALL branches prevented bitmap index combination.
   RULE: Do NOT split the item OR condition (i_manufact_id IN ... OR i_manager_id BETWEEN) into UNION ALL.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output single column "excess discount amount" as sum.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream: i_item_sk, d_date_sk, cs_ext_discount_amt, cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, etc.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literal values: i_manufact_id IN (184, 307, 365, 560, 681), i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71, d_date between '2001-02-23' and +90 days, cs_list_price BETWEEN 115 AND 144, ratio BETWEEN 0.21 AND 0.41.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same sum of discounts.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (catalog_sales, item, date_dim).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Scalar correlated subquery on cs_item_sk = i_item_sk re-executes per outer row.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- Apply the 3-CTE decomposition pattern: dimension filter CTEs + threshold CTE. Use AS MATERIALIZED on CTEs to prevent inlining. Ignore any UNION ALL aspects (query has no UNION).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
                             cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 16 and 45
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'

    JOIN filtered_items fi ON fi.i_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
    WHERE dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 16 AND 45
      AND dfs.cs_sales_price / dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
    GROUP BY dfs.cs_item_sk

SELECT sum(dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM date_filtered_sales dfs
JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `excess discount amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER ((i_manufact_id IN (184, 307, 365, 560, 681) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2001-02-23' AND CAST('2001-02-23' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (excess discount amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
