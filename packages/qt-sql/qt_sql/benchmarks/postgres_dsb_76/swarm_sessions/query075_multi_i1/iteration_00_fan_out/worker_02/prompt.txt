You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Compare year-over-year sales quantities and amounts for Home category items sold at 34-54% discount with specific return reasons, identifying products where current year sales dropped by more than 10% relative to prior year. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (item, date_dim) plus LEFT JOIN with returns tables (must preserve sales rows even without returns). Aggregation traps: None - only SUM and subtraction, no grouping-sensitive aggregates. Filter dependencies: The ratio filter (curr_yr.sales_cnt/prev_yr.sales_cnt < 0.9) depends on both years' aggregated values; rewriting must preserve exact decimal casting.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION branches must remain UNION ALL, not merged into single query.
- filtered_item must be LEFT JOINed to returns tables to preserve sales rows without returns.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression: 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTE prevents parallel execution of downstream operations.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping entire UNION in a CTE that must be materialized before parallel processing; keep UNION inside parallelizable subtree.
2. Splitting OR into UNION (observed regression: 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN handles multi-branch ORs efficiently; splitting loses bitmap optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT split the reason_sk IN list into separate UNION branches.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output 10 columns with exact aliases: prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt for downstream self-join.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: i_category='Home', discount range 0.34-0.54, reason_sk in (7,25,26,52,69), years 1999 and 1998.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exact same 100 rows ordered by sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows item table scanned 3x (once per UNION branch) with same filter i_category='Home'.
- UNION_CONSOLIDATION: Three UNION branches share identical dimension joins (item, date_dim) but executed separately.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtered dimension CTEs; use explicit JOIN syntax (already present). Ignore promotion table.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters into CTE definitions; pre-filter item and date_dim early. Ignore decorrelation (no subqueries).
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Share filtered_item and filtered_date CTEs across all three UNION branches. Ignore any consolidation of fact tables.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
