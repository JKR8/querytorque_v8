<reasoning>
1. **CLASSIFY**: This is a multi-channel star-join with non-equi date correlation. The query joins three fact tables (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales) with multiple dimension tables, and includes a temporal correlation condition (d2.d_date between d1.d_date + 90 days). It's a classic "channel comparison" pattern with a date window constraint.

2. **EXPLAIN PLAN ANALYSIS**:
   - Total runtime: 2213.5ms
   - Dominant operations (wall-clock):
     1. Hash Join Inner (store_returns + item): 52.9ms × 3 workers = ~159ms total
     2. Nested Loop Inner (store_sales lookup): 0.0ms per loop but 352,461 loops → significant total time (hidden in aggregate)
     3. Gather Merge + Sort: 2181.1ms total (including parallel work)
     4. Nested Loop for web_sales: 231 loops × 0.1ms = ~23ms
   - Row count drops:
     - date_dim d1: 24K rows → 122 rows after filter (d_year=1998)
     - store_returns: 2,439 rows per d1 row → ~297K total after join
     - item: 12K rows after category filter
     - store_sales: 0 rows per loop (filter ss_sales_price/ss_list_price ratio eliminates almost all rows)
     - The query returns 0 rows total, indicating extreme selectivity
   - Optimizer already handles:
     - Pushes date_dim filter (d_year=1998) into index scan
     - Uses index-only scans on selective dimensions (item, store_returns)
     - Parallel execution with 2 workers
   - Scan counts:
     - store_sales: scanned once via index (per store_returns row)
     - store_returns: scanned once via index (per date_dim row)
     - web_sales: scanned once via bitmap index (per store_returns row)
     - Each dimension table scanned once
   - The plan shows PostgreSQL is already doing aggressive predicate pushdown and using indexes effectively.

3. **GAP MATCHING**:
   - COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Present. Query uses implicit comma joins. Convert to explicit JOINs.
   - CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Not present (no correlated subqueries).
   - CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Not present (no repeated CTE scans).
   - NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Present. The date window condition (d2.d_date between d1.d_date AND d1.d_date + 90 days) is a non-equi join filter applied late (as Join Filter in Nested Loop). Could benefit from pre-filtering both date dimensions.

4. **AGGREGATION TRAP CHECK**: Query uses COUNT(*), which is grouping-insensitive (safe against duplicates). No FILTER clauses or sensitive aggregates.

5. **TRANSFORM SELECTION** (4 diverse strategies):
   a) **Star-join prefetch + explicit joins**: Addresses comma-join weakness and pre-filters selective dimensions.
   b) **Non-equi join optimization**: Addresses date window blindness by pre-filtering date ranges.
   c) **Late attribute binding**: Defer non-filtering dimension joins (customer, address, household) until after fact aggregation.
   d) **Exploration**: Combine explicit JOINs with MATERIALIZED CTEs for all dimensions (compound strategy).

6. **LOGICAL TREE DESIGN**:
   For each strategy, design CTEs that include all columns referenced downstream (customer keys, date keys, item keys, etc.).
   Verify column completeness for each node contract.

=== SHARED BRIEFING ===

SEMANTIC_CONTRACT:
This query identifies customers who made purchases across store and web channels within 90 days, with specific product categories and demographic filters. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is safe to restructuring. The date window filter (d2 between d1 and d1+90) creates a temporal dependency between the store return date and web sale date.

BOTTLENECK_DIAGNOSIS:
The query is join-bound with extreme selectivity, returning 0 rows despite scanning millions. Dominant cost is the parallel gather-merge-sort (2181ms) operating on near-empty results. The optimizer already handles predicate pushdown well (filters on date_dim, item, household_demographics pushed to index scans). Logical-tree cost percentages are misleading—the 100% cost node shows ~890K rows but actual execution yields 0 rows due to ratio filter (ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.35 AND 0.55) eliminating all matches.

ACTIVE_CONSTRAINTS:
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include customer keys, date keys, item keys, and any columns used in downstream joins/filters
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'), ca_state IN ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX'), d1.d_year=1998, hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13, hd_buy_potential='0-500', ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 35*0.01 AND 55*0.01
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 0 rows with same grouping and ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM store_sales, store_returns, web_sales...)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Date window condition applied as late Join Filter in Nested Loop

REGRESSION_WARNINGS:
1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression 0.50x on Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: For fact table scans (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales), avoid wrapping in MATERIALIZED CTEs if they would benefit from parallel scans
2. Nestloop disable on selective lookups (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: SET enable_nestloop=off forced hash joins for small selective lookups, increasing overhead
   RULE: Preserve optimizer's choice of nested loops for indexed lookups on highly selective filters

EXAMPLE_ADAPTATION:
  pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of all selective dimensions (date, item, customer dimensions) into CTEs; convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax; ignore the UNION ALL pattern as this query has no UNION.
  pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Isolate date_dim filters into separate CTEs for d1 and d2; use explicit JOINs throughout; ignore the single-date-dimension aspect (this query uses two date_dim instances).
  star_join_prefetch: Pre-filter dimension tables before joining with fact tables; create a star-like structure with fact tables at the center; ignore any aggregation pushdown as aggregation happens after all joins.
HAZARD_FLAGS:
- Risk of materializing large intermediate results (filtered_store_returns at ~297K rows) in CTEs
- Date window condition between d1 and d2 may be expensive to compute in filtered_dates_d2 CTE

  dimension_cte_isolate: Isolate dimension filters but apply them late; in this case, we isolate the customer dimension filters but apply them after aggregation; ignore the pre-filtering of dimensions into early CTEs.
