You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers who made purchases across store and web channels within 90 days, with specific product categories and demographic filters. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is safe to restructuring. The date window filter (d2 between d1 and d1+90) creates a temporal dependency between the store return date and web sale date.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Date_pairs CTE may produce Cartesian product (122 × ~90 = ~11K rows) which could be large
- Risk of double-joining date_pairs (once for store_returns, once for web_sales) causing confusion

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression 0.50x on Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: For fact table scans (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales), avoid wrapping in MATERIALIZED CTEs if they would benefit from parallel scans
2. Nestloop disable on selective lookups (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: SET enable_nestloop=off forced hash joins for small selective lookups, increasing overhead
   RULE: Preserve optimizer's choice of nested loops for indexed lookups on highly selective filters

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include customer keys, date keys, item keys, and any columns used in downstream joins/filters
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'), ca_state IN ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX'), d1.d_year=1998, hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13, hd_buy_potential='0-500', ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 35*0.01 AND 55*0.01
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 0 rows with same grouping and ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM store_sales, store_returns, web_sales...)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Date window condition applied as late Join Filter in Nested Loop

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply staged reduction by pre-joining date dimensions with the non-equi condition before joining with fact tables; use MATERIALIZED CTEs for the date_pairs to prevent re-execution; ignore the fact table prefiltering aspect (store_sales and web_sales remain large).
  non_equi_join_input_blindness: Address the date window blindness by materializing the valid date pairs first; then use those pre-computed pairs to filter fact table joins; ignore any decorrelation patterns (no correlated subqueries).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~890K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), web_sales (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), item (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), household_demographics (join))

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
