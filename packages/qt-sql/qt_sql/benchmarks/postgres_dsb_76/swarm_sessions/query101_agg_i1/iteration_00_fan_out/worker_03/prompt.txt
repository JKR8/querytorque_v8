You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers who made purchases across store and web channels within 90 days, with specific product categories and demographic filters. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is safe to restructuring. The date window filter (d2 between d1 and d1+90) creates a temporal dependency between the store return date and web sale date.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- May miss optimization opportunities from pushing customer filters earlier (though they're selective)
- Aggregation on ss_customer_sk alone may produce more rows than final result (if customers filtered out by state/income later)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression 0.50x on Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: For fact table scans (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales), avoid wrapping in MATERIALIZED CTEs if they would benefit from parallel scans
2. Nestloop disable on selective lookups (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: SET enable_nestloop=off forced hash joins for small selective lookups, increasing overhead
   RULE: Preserve optimizer's choice of nested loops for indexed lookups on highly selective filters

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include customer keys, date keys, item keys, and any columns used in downstream joins/filters
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'), ca_state IN ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX'), d1.d_year=1998, hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13, hd_buy_potential='0-500', ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 35*0.01 AND 55*0.01
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 0 rows with same grouping and ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM store_sales, store_returns, web_sales...)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Date window condition applied as late Join Filter in Nested Loop

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

late_attribute_binding: Defer customer, customer_address, and household_demographics joins until after aggregation, since they are only used for filtering/display and not in join conditions with other fact tables; keep all fact table joins and filters in the core CTE; ignore any CTE materialization directives (let optimizer decide).
  dimension_cte_isolate: Isolate dimension filters but apply them late; in this case, we isolate the customer dimension filters but apply them after aggregation; ignore the pre-filtering of dimensions into early CTEs.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, count(*) as cnt
FROM
store_sales,
store_returns,
web_sales,
date_dim d1,
date_dim d2,
item,
customer,
customer_address,
household_demographics
WHERE
ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
AND ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
AND c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
AND sr_item_sk = ws_item_sk
AND i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
AND i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music')
AND sr_returned_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
AND ws_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
AND d2.d_date between d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + interval '90 day')
AND ca_state in ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX')
AND d1.d_year = 1998
AND hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13
AND hd_buy_potential = '0-500'
AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 35 * 0.01 AND 55 * 0.01
GROUP BY c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name
ORDER BY cnt
;
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~890K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), web_sales (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), item (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), household_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number)
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+8 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'))
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_date BETWEEN d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + INTERVAL '90 DAY'))
    ├── FILTER (+5 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
