You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Compare year-over-year sales of Children's items across all channels (catalog, store, web) for items with 69-89% of list price and specific return reasons. JOIN semantics: INNER joins between sales and item/date_dim; LEFT joins to returns (but filtered on return reason, effectively INNER). Aggregation trap: SUM of net sales (sales minus returns) is additive and safe. Filter dependencies: The price ratio filter must be applied per row before net sales calculation; return reason filter must be applied to returns before the LEFT join becomes effective INNER.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex OR condition may prevent efficient index usage. PostgreSQL may not use indexes on the unioned result.
- Large UNION of all sales and returns tables before joins could increase memory.
- Risk of correctness: Must ensure each channel's specific columns are correctly mapped.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION (0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL when PostgreSQL can use bitmap index scans.
   RULE: This query has no OR conditions on indexed columns; do not introduce UNION splits.
2. CTE blocks parallelism (structural bottleneck):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of underlying tables.
   RULE: Consider using subqueries or temporary tables if parallelism is critical (but baseline already uses parallel workers in CTE branches).
None applicable for other patterns.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt for downstream joins and filters.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: 'Children', 69*0.01, 89*0.01, reason_sk list (8,18,20,23,41), year 1999, 1998.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same rows as original (100 rows limit, ordered by sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows item scanned 3x, date_dim 3x across UNION branches - opportunity to materialize once.
- JOIN_ORDER_TRAP: Plan shows nested loops dominating; dimension prefetch may enable hash joins.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply sharing filtered_item and filtered_date across all channels. Ignore the fact that channels are separate fact tables; we union them early.
- union_cte_split: Instead of splitting, we are consolidating the UNION branches into a single query with channel discriminator.
- single_pass_aggregation: Attempt to compute net sales in a single pass per channel (already done). We are extending to cross-channel single pass via UNION of fact tables.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
