You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Compare year-over-year sales of Children's items across all channels (catalog, store, web) for items with 69-89% of list price and specific return reasons. JOIN semantics: INNER joins between sales and item/date_dim; LEFT joins to returns (but filtered on return reason, effectively INNER). Aggregation trap: SUM of net sales (sales minus returns) is additive and safe. Filter dependencies: The price ratio filter must be applied per row before net sales calculation; return reason filter must be applied to returns before the LEFT join becomes effective INNER.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure each year's aggregation includes all channels (catalog, store, web). The UNION branches must be replicated for each year CTE.
- Duplicate code: two nearly identical CTEs for 1999 and 1998. Could use a parameterized CTE but not supported.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION (0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL when PostgreSQL can use bitmap index scans.
   RULE: This query has no OR conditions on indexed columns; do not introduce UNION splits.
2. CTE blocks parallelism (structural bottleneck):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of underlying tables.
   RULE: Consider using subqueries or temporary tables if parallelism is critical (but baseline already uses parallel workers in CTE branches).
None applicable for other patterns.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt for downstream joins and filters.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: 'Children', 69*0.01, 89*0.01, reason_sk list (8,18,20,23,41), year 1999, 1998.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same rows as original (100 rows limit, ordered by sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows item scanned 3x, date_dim 3x across UNION branches - opportunity to materialize once.
- JOIN_ORDER_TRAP: Plan shows nested loops dominating; dimension prefetch may enable hash joins.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_self_join_decomposition: Apply materializing the fact+dimension scan once per year (two CTEs) instead of self-joining a single CTE. Ignore the per-item/per-store average derivation (this query compares years).
- early_filter_decorrelate: Push year filter early into each UNION branch (decorrelate from main query). Ignore decorrelation of subqueries (none present).
- pushdown: Push d_year filter down to date_dim join in each UNION branch.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**

		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and

```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
