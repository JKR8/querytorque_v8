You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query finds minimum sales metrics for specific customer demographics and address profiles in the year 2001. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches across all tables. Aggregates are MIN functions which are duplicate-insensitive. The two sets of OR conditions are independent: Set A (demographics) and Set B (address/profit) must BOTH be satisfied via AND, but within each set any branch can satisfy.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Fact CTE may still be large (filters not very selective).
- Need to re-apply address/profit filters after join because ca_state filter interacts with net_profit.
- MATERIALIZED keyword may prevent parallelism.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR-to-UNION on indexed columns (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions on indexed columns into UNION ALL prevented bitmap index scans.
   RULE: For this query, ss_sales_price is NOT the indexed column of the scan (index is on ss_sold_date_sk), so risk may differ. Still caution.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs 4 MIN aggregates; all must be preserved.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ss_quantity, ss_ext_sales_price, ss_ext_wholesale_cost, plus join keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (2001, 'M', '2 yr Degree', 100.00, 150.00, 3, 'S', 'Primary', 50.00, 100.00, 'W', 150.00, 200.00, 1, 'United States', state lists, profit ranges) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must be identical.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows optimizer converts to explicit joins but syntax limits optimization.
- OR_FILTER_LATE_APPLICATION: ss_sales_price filter applied after index scan on ss_sold_date_sk, removing 13K rows late.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply materialized CTE for fact table with filters before joining dimensions. Ignore non-equi joins.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early filtering of fact table into CTE. Ignore decorrelation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `MIN(ss_quantity)`
  2. `MIN(ss_ext_sales_price)`
  3. `MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)`
  4. `MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~168K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2001)
    └── OUTPUT (MIN(ss_quantity), MIN(ss_ext_sales_price), MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost), MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
