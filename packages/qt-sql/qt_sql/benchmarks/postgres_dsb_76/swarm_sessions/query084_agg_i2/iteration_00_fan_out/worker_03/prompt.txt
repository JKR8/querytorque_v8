You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Retrieve 100 customers from Mount Vernon within a specific income band who have store returns, ordered by customer ID. All joins are INNER (intersection) - all dimension tables must match. No aggregation traps exist. The ca_city filter on customer_address and income_band bounds are independent; rewrites must preserve these exact literal values.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_fact CTE (store_returns with customer_demographics join) -> JOIN with filtered dimensions -> SORT -> LIMIT
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  fact_with_cdemo:
    FROM: store_returns
    JOIN: INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON store_returns.sr_cdemo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk
    OUTPUT: sr_cdemo_sk, cd_demo_sk, (all columns from both tables needed downstream)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~5 per cd_demo_sk (total unknown)
    CONSUMERS: main_query
  main_query:

           INNER JOIN household_demographics ON household_demographics.hd_demo_sk = customer.c_current_hdemo_sk
           INNER JOIN income_band ON income_band.ib_income_band_sk = household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk
    WHERE: customer_address.ca_city = 'Mount Vernon'
           AND income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 40374
           AND income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 90374
    ORDER BY: customer.c_customer_id
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: customer.c_customer_id AS customer_id, COALESCE(customer.c_last_name,'') || ', ' || COALESCE(customer.c_first_name,'') AS customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 100

    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~5 per cd_demo_sk (total unknown)
    CONSUMERS: main_query

           INNER JOIN household_demographics ON household_demographics.hd_demo_sk = customer.c_current_hdemo_sk
           INNER JOIN income_band ON income_band.ib_income_band_sk = household_demographics.hd_income_band_sk
    WHERE: customer_address.ca_city = 'Mount Vernon'
           AND income_band.ib_lower_bound >= 40374
           AND income_band.ib_upper_bound <= 90374
    ORDER BY: customer.c_customer_id
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: customer.c_customer_id AS customer_id, COALESCE(customer.c_last_name,'') || ', ' || COALESCE(customer.c_first_name,'') AS customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 100
    CONSUMERS: final output

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Starting from store_returns may increase rows early if there are many returns per customer.
  - May lose efficiency of index scans on dimension tables.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large tables.
   RULE: Avoid CTEs on large fact tables (store_returns) when baseline uses parallel execution.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output customer_id and customername exactly as defined.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve 'Mount Vernon', 40374, and 50000 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows in same order.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM customer, customer_address...).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply: Start from the fact table (store_returns) and join outward, applying dimension filters late.
  Ignore: The decorrelation aspect - no correlated subqueries here.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

**BEFORE (slow):**

    AND d_year = 2001
    AND sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 236 AND 295
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk
)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer, customer_demographics

```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~500K
    ├── SCAN (customer, customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), income_band (join), store_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (ca_city = 'Mount Vernon')
    ├── FILTER (ib_lower_bound >= 40374)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (c_customer_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customername)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
