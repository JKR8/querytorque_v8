**Changes:** Restructured to match target logical tree by extracting store_returns + customer_demographics join into a CTE and converting comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax. This preserves the exact semantic intersection while following the required CTE structure.

**Expected speedup:** Neutral to slight slowdown (0.8–1.0x) due to CTE materialization potentially blocking parallelism, but follows required structure exactly.
