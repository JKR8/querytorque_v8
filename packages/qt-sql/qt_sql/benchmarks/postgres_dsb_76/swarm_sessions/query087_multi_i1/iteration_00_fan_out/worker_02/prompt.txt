You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Count distinct customer-date combinations that appear in store sales but NOT in catalog sales nor web sales, for customers born 1955-1961, items priced $242-$271 with wholesale cost $35-$45, during a specific 12-month period. JOIN semantics are strict INNER joins: all three tables must match in each subquery. No aggregation traps (only COUNT). Filter dependencies: date filter (d_month_seq) applies identically to all three channels; customer birth_year filter applies to all channels; price/wholesale filters are channel-specific but identical in value ranges.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must handle duplicate tuples within a channel (original has DISTINCT per channel). Use DISTINCT inside each UNION ALL branch or GROUP BY with array_agg(DISTINCT).
- array_agg(DISTINCT) ordering may differ but semantic equivalence preserved.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS to IN/NOT IN (observed regression 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Converting EXCEPT to NOT IN with NULL values blocks hash anti-joins.
   RULE: When converting EXCEPT to NOT EXISTS, ensure join columns are NOT NULL or use NOT EXISTS correlated subquery.
2. Splitting OR to UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x):
   CAUSE: This query has no OR conditions; do not introduce UNION ALL branches unnecessarily.
   RULE: Only use UNION ALL when consolidating multiple fact table scans with same dimension joins.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output COUNT(*) exactly as original.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_date_sk, d_date, c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name, c_birth_year for downstream joins and SELECT.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All numeric literals (1214, 11, 242, 271, 1955, 1961, 35, 45) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: EXCEPT semantics must be preserved; no duplicate introduction or filtering beyond original.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (store_sales, date_dim, customer).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim and customer tables scanned 3× with identical filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Share filtered date_dim and customer CTEs across UNION ALL branches. Ignore any aggregation pushdown.
- union_cte_split: Use UNION ALL to combine channels, then group by output columns. Ignore splitting into separate CTEs (we're consolidating).
- pg_self_join_decomposition: Materialize filtered dimensions once and reuse across channels. Ignore the self-join pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~5.0M
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214 + 11)
    ├── FILTER (ws_list_price BETWEEN 242 AND 271)
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
