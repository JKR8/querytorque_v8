## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Reducer: Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Apply early_filter patterns to the query.

        customer_demographics,
        household_demographics

        cr_call_center_sk       = cc_call_center_sk

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
    WHERE [1320388869737ae6]: cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cr_returning_custom...
    GROUP BY: cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    ORDER BY: SUM(cr_net_loss)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date  (via Q1)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_year = 2001 AND d_moy = 12
  CTE: filtered_cd  (via Q2)
    FROM: customer_demographics
    WHERE: (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown') OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
  CTE: filtered_hd  (via Q3)
    FROM: household_demographics
    WHERE: hd_buy_potential LIKE '>10000%'
  CTE: filtered_ca  (via Q4)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_gmt_offset = -6
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_returns
    JOIN filtered_date ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN call_center ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
    JOIN customer ON cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN filtered_cd ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
    JOIN filtered_hd ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
    JOIN filtered_ca ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
    GROUP BY: cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    ORDER BY: SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
