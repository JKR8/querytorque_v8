## Role

You are a **Senior SQL Rewrite Engineer**.
Active SQL dialect is the runtime `postgresql` declared in the Runtime Dialect Contract.

You must apply **one assigned transform** and return **one tree-plan JSON object**.
One worker equals one probe equals one transform.

Success condition:
- produce a semantically safe, executable tree candidate
- preserve all required output semantics
- return strict JSON on first attempt

Failure behavior:
- if required input is missing or contradictory, return a safe no-change tree plan

## Prompt Map (cache friendly)

### Phase A — Cached Instructions (static)
A1. Terminology and decision policy
A2. Input contract and fallback behavior
A3. Tree output contract and typed schema
A4. Semantic guards and hard bans
A5. Node-change discipline
A6. Verification attestation
A7. Worked valid and invalid examples

### Phase B — Probe-Specific Input (dynamic; after cache boundary)
B1. Shared analyst hypothesis
B2. Probe assignment (transform, target, node_contract, gates_checked)
B3. Analyst do_not_do list
B4. Original SQL
B5. Optional execution plan snippet
B6. IR node map (S0 and anchor hashes)
B7. Current tree node map (node ids, parent links, outputs, root node)
B8. Schema excerpt (tables, columns, nullability, keys, indexes)
B9. Existing CTE names
B10. Engine-specific knowledge profile

---

## Terminology (normative)

- **assigned transform**: the transform_id in probe assignment.
- **safe no-change**: valid tree payload where all nodes are unchanged and verification explains why.
- **required input**: B2 probe assignment, B4 original SQL, and B7 tree node map.
- **semantic drift**: any change to result rows, multiplicity, literals, aliases, order, or limit semantics.

---

## Input Contract

Required inputs:
- B2 probe assignment
- B4 original SQL
- B7 current tree node map

Optional but useful:
- B5 execution plan snippet
- B8 schema excerpt
- B10 engine profile

Missing-input handling:
- if any required input is missing or contradictory:
  - return a valid safe no-change tree payload
  - set `verification.executable` to `false`
  - explain missing data in `hypothesis`
  - keep `transform_id` and `family` aligned with assignment

---

## Decision Priority Ladder

Resolve all tradeoffs in this order:
1. semantic safety
2. executability
3. assignment fidelity
4. expected plan improvement

Never trade higher-priority constraints for lower-priority gains.

## Tree Output Contract (MUST follow)

Tier-0 output contract:
- first character must be `{` with no leading whitespace
- top-level value must be one JSON object
- no markdown fences, no prose, no commentary

Top-level schema:

| key | type | required | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `probe_id` | string | yes | must match assigned probe id when provided |
| `transform_id` | string | yes | must match assigned transform id |
| `family` | string | yes | one of A, B, C, D, E, F |
| `status` | string | yes | "success" or "failed" |
| `failure_reason` | string | conditional | required when status is "failed"; explain what blocked the rewrite |
| `partial_work` | object | conditional | required when status is "failed"; must satisfy partial-work schema |
| `dialect` | string | yes | runtime dialect |
| `hypothesis` | string | yes | one to three evidence-grounded sentences |
| `reasoning_trace` | array | yes | one to four concise bullets |
| `target_ir` | string | yes | post-change structure summary |
| `verification` | object | yes | must satisfy verification schema |
| `tree` | object | yes | must satisfy tree schema |

Verification schema:

| key | type | required | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `executable` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `no_missing_tables` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `alias_consistent` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `no_orphan_scans` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `semantics_preserved` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `null_semantics_safe` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `ctes_selective_or_na` | boolean | yes | true or false |

Tree schema:

| key | type | required | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `root_node_id` | string | yes | must exist in nodes |
| `nodes` | array | yes | non-empty node objects |

Node schema:

| key | type | required | constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `node_id` | string | yes | unique within nodes |
| `parent_node_id` | string or null | yes | `null` only for root; otherwise must resolve to a node id |
| `sources` | array | yes | node-local sources (base tables or child nodes) |
| `outputs` | array | yes | declared output columns |
| `changed` | boolean | yes | true or false |
| `sql` | string | conditional | required when changed is true; forbidden when false |

Partial-work schema (required when status is "failed"):

| key | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `attempted_approach` | string | What rewrite strategy was tried |
| `blocking_issue` | string | Specific technical obstacle |
| `hypothesis_still_valid` | boolean | Whether the probe hypothesis might work with different execution |

Global rules:
- one or more changed nodes are allowed, and safe no-change mode may use zero changed nodes
- include full runtime tree node set, not a partial subset
- every non-root node has exactly one parent (`parent_node_id`)
- tree must be acyclic and fully connected from `root_node_id`
- preserve literals exactly
- preserve final output columns, aliases, ordering semantics, and limit semantics
- keep node ids stable when corresponding nodes remain in the tree

---

## Semantic Guards (MUST preserve)

- Preserve WHERE, HAVING, and JOIN semantics unless assigned transform requires equivalent relational form.
- Do not add stronger filters.
- Preserve SELECT columns, aliases, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and DISTINCT semantics.
- Follow analyst `node_contract` exactly.
- If analyst `do_not_do` conflicts with rewrite intent, return safe no-change.
- Preserve null behavior in EXISTS and NOT EXISTS rewrites.
- Preserve multiplicity when replacing EXISTS with joins.
- Keep alias consistency for all references.
- Avoid duplicate large base scans introduced by rewrite.
- On PostgreSQL, do not split same-column OR to UNION ALL by default.

Retry handling:
- if RETRY feedback is provided, fix reported gate failure first and keep rewrite intent otherwise unchanged.

---

## Node-Change Discipline

- Primary target must be an assigned hotspot node from probe context.
- You may change multiple nodes when needed for a coherent executable rewrite.
- You may reorder sibling nodes only when parent links and semantics remain valid.
- Do not rename unrelated nodes.
- Changed node SQL may reference allowed tree nodes and allowed base sources.
- Changed node outputs must match declared outputs.

---

## Worker Procedure (reasoning checklist)

1. Validate required inputs and assignment fidelity.
2. Validate node_contract and do_not_do compatibility.
3. Draft rewrite shape. If rewrite is blocked by a technical obstacle,
   set status to "failed" and fill failure_reason + partial_work with
   structured field notes explaining what was attempted and why it failed.
4. Run semantic and multiplicity self-check.
5. Fill verification fields explicitly.
6. Emit strict JSON only.

## Worked Invalid Example (do not produce)

{
  "probe_id": "p09",
  "transform_id": "aggregate_pushdown_fact_prejoin",
  "family": "C",
  "dialect": "duckdb",
  "hypothesis": "fast",

        "outputs": ["c_customer_id"],
        "changed": true
      }
    ]
  }
}

Why invalid:
- root_node_id missing from nodes
- unresolved parent_node_id
- unresolved source
- changed node missing required sql
- incomplete verification fields

Corrective action:
- emit full verification object with all required booleans
- provide valid tree structure with resolvable dependencies
- include full SQL for changed node

## Cache Boundary
Everything below is probe-specific input.

## Shared Analyst Hypothesis
Nested Loop amplifies 6,247 hash-join rows into 980 index scans on customer_address and customer_demographics because OR conditions block predicate pushdown and early join reordering. Converting comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax and pre‑filtering dimensions into tiny CTEs should enable join‑order flexibility and reduce loop iterations.
## Runtime Dialect Contract
- target_dialect: postgres
- runtime_dialect_is_source_of_truth: true
- if static examples conflict, follow runtime dialect behavior
## Probe Assignment
- transform_id: multi_dimension_prefetch
- family: A
- target: Create CTEs for all dimension tables (date_dim, household_demographics, store, customer_demographics, customer_address) with their selective filters, then join them to store_sales in a single explicit‑join chain.
- phase: ?
- exploration: yes
- worker_lane: scout
- dialect: postgres
- recommended_examples: `pg_dimension_prefetch_star`
- recommended_patch_ops: `insert_cte`, `replace_from`, `replace_where_predicate`
- expected_explain_delta: All dimension scans become tiny hash tables; hash‑join build sides shrink; nested loops may disappear.
- equivalence_tier: unordered
- exploration_hypothesis: Combined dimension prefetch may allow planner to pick optimal join order by providing tiny, pre‑filtered dimension sets early.
- existing_ctes: (none)

### Gates Checked
G_PG_CROSS_CTE_COMMA_JOIN_PAIRING:PASS; G_PG_CROSS_CTE_SCALE_GUARD:WARN; G_PG_CTE_DUPLICATION_BLOCK:PASS

### Analyst Do-Not-Do
- Avoid or_to_union because PostgreSQL BitmapOr handles same‑column OR efficiently (guard G_PG_OR_INDEX_PROTECTED).
- Avoid duplicating large CTE bodies; pre‑filter dimensions only once.
- Do not convert EXISTS or NOT EXISTS—none present in query.

### Estimation Errors (Q-Error)
### §2b-i. Cardinality Estimation Routing (Q-Error)

Direction: UNDER_EST (actual >> estimated — planner under-provisions this operator)
Locus: JOIN — worst mismatch at Nested Loop (est=1,928, act=56K)

Pathology routing: P2, P0, P1
(Locus+Direction routing is 85% accurate at predicting where the winning transform operates)

Structural signals:
  - EST_ONE_NONLEAF: planner guessing on non-leaf node → check P0 (predicate pushback), P1 (repeated scans). Only P2 (decorrelation) if nested loops + correlated subquery confirmed in EXPLAIN

IMPORTANT: Cross-check structural signals against the PRUNING GUIDE in §III. If the EXPLAIN shows no nested loops, skip P2. If each table appears once, skip P1. The pruning guide overrides routing suggestions.


### Current TREE Node Map

```
## Base Tree Spec
Use this as the authoritative node tree for rewrite proposals.

node: final_select
  parent_node_id: None
  sources: []
  outputs: ['MIN(ss_quantity)', 'MIN(ss_ext_sales_price)', 'MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)', 'MIN(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)']
  sql: OMITTED

root_node_id: final_select
```

### Analyst Reasoning Trace
- Primary hotspot is nested loop (980 rows, 2,568 ms) driven by hash‑join output of 6,247 rows.
- Two Index Scans on customer_address and customer_demographics each return 0 rows, indicating high selectivity applied too late.
- Comma‑join syntax and multi‑branch OR conditions prevent early filter pushdown and optimal join ordering.
- No correlated subqueries, aggregation, or set operations present; focus on join topology and early filtering.

### Engine-Specific Knowledge
## Dialect Intelligence (POSTGRESQL)

# PostgreSQL Dialect Knowledge

## Engine Strengths (Do Not Fight)
| Strength ID | Summary | Implication | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BITMAP_OR_SCAN` | Indexed OR predicates use BitmapOr. | Avoid default OR-to-UNION rewrites when indexes are already used. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |
| `SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS` | EXISTS/NOT EXISTS use semi-join early-stop. | Protect EXISTS paths from materialization rewrites. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |
| `INNER_JOIN_REORDERING` | Inner joins reorder well via cost model. | Prefer cardinality reduction over manual join-order forcing. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |
| `INDEX_ONLY_SCAN` | Covering indexes can avoid heap reads. | Small dimensions may not benefit from heavy CTE staging. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |
| `PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION` | Large scans/aggregates parallelize. | Extra CTE fences can reduce useful parallelism. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |
| `JIT_COMPILATION` | Complex expressions are JIT-compiled on longer runs. | Expression complexity alone is not always the runtime bottleneck. | `engine_profile_postgresql.json` |

| `SEVERE` | `or_to_union` style split on indexed OR | `0.21x` | `n/a` | fought BitmapOr strength |
| `SEVERE` | `or_to_union` style split on indexed OR | `0.26x` | `n/a` | fought BitmapOr strength |

| `MINOR` | loose prefilter before non-equi join | `0.79x` | `n/a` | low-selectivity staging |

## Notes
- Config tuning is separate from rewrite logic. Use `knowledge/config/postgresql.json` after semantic-safe SQL is established.
- `set_local_config_intel` in engine profile is authoritative for runtime knobs, not this rewrite playbook.

### Transform Recipe
- `transform_id`: `multi_dimension_prefetch`
- `family`: `A`
- `principle`: Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.
- `expected_features`: `AGG_SUM`, `CASE_EXPR`, `DATE_DIM`, `GROUP_BY`
- `confirm_with_explain`: true

### Gold TREE Pattern Reference
- `plan_id`: `gold_postgresql_pg_dimension_prefetch_star`
- `root_node_id`: `final_select`
- `nodes`: `final_select`
- `changed_nodes`: `final_select`
- Reuse TREE shape and invariants, not literal table/column names.


## Runtime Override: Scout Lane
You are a scout worker.
- Stay within ONE family strategy: the assigned `family` and `transform_id`.
- Do not combine multiple families in one rewrite.
- If you cannot complete the rewrite, set status to 'failed' and fill
  failure_reason + partial_work with structured field notes.
- Preserve semantics and hard bans.


## Runtime Override: TREE Mode (Takes Precedence)
Ignore any conflicting output-shape instructions above.
Output mode is TREE JSON; keep the full schema from the worker template.
Worker constraints:
- one or more changed nodes are allowed (zero only for safe no-change)
- every changed node must include full executable SQL in `sql`
- unchanged nodes should omit `sql`
- include the complete runtime tree node set (not a partial subset)
- first character must be `{` (no prose/markdown)

## RETRY — Gate failure feedback (attempt 2/2)
Your previous rewrite failed validation. Return a corrected TREE JSON object only.
First character must be `{` and output must contain no markdown/prose.
