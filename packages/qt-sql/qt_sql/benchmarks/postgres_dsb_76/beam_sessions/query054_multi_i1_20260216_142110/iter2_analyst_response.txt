### Step 1 — Compare EXPLAIN Plans  
All patches in the latest iteration (Iteration 1) **FAILED**, so there are no winners to analyze. The failures were due to structural issues with column references in the rewrite attempts. The original plan remains the baseline.

---

### Step 2 — Design Targets  
**Primary Bottleneck**: The `Append` operator (union of `catalog_sales` and `web_sales`) processes 1,792 rows and takes 1.471 ms. This feeds into a `Nested Loop` (18,519 rows, 17.2 ms) and `Hash Join` (134 rows, 18.643 ms). Filters are applied late in the CTE, missing early reduction opportunities.

**Targets**:  
1. **Combination (A+E)**: Fix the failed Family A pushdown while retaining Family E’s date prefetch. Push `item`/`date_dim` filters into union branches to reduce `Append` rows.  
2. **Refinement (C)**: Pre-aggregate sales before joining with `customer` to shrink the `Nested Loop` (18,519 rows).  
3. **Rescue (A)**: Repair the column-mismatch error in filter pushdown while preserving semantics.  
4. **Novel (F)**: Convert comma joins to explicit `INNER JOIN` and reorder to prioritize selective filters.
