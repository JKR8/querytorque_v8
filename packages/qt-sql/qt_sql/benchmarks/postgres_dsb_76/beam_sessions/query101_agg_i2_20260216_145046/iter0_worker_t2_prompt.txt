## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — dimension_predicate_pushdown
**Hypothesis**: Dimension table filters (item.category, customer_address.state, household_demographics) are applied late. Push them into CTEs to reduce early join cardinality.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, count(*) as cnt
FROM
store_sales,
store_returns,
web_sales,
date_dim d1,
date_dim d2,
item,
customer,
customer_address,
household_demographics
WHERE
ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
AND ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
AND c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
AND sr_item_sk = ws_item_sk
AND i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
AND i_category IN ('Children', 'Home', 'Women')
AND sr_returned_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
AND ws_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
AND d2.d_date between d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + interval '90 day')
AND ca_state in ('AR', 'GA', 'IN', 'KY', 'VA')
AND d1.d_year = 2000
AND hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 8 AND 14
AND hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 76 * 0.01 AND 96 * 0.01
GROUP BY c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name
ORDER BY cnt
;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: store_sales, store_returns, web_sales, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, item, customer, customer_address, household_demographics
    WHERE [f2ece665ad1a915f]: ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number AND ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk AND ss_customer_sk =...
    GROUP BY: c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name
    ORDER BY: cnt

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_item (via Q1)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category IN ('Children', 'Home', 'Women')
  CTE: filtered_ca (via Q2)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_state IN ('AR', 'GA', 'IN', 'KY', 'VA')
  CTE: filtered_hd (via Q3)
    FROM: household_demographics
    WHERE: hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 8 AND 14 AND hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
  MAIN QUERY
    FROM: store_sales
    INNER JOIN store_returns ON ...
    INNER JOIN filtered_item ON ...
    INNER JOIN customer ON ...
    INNER JOIN filtered_ca ON ...
    INNER JOIN filtered_hd ON ...
    INNER JOIN date_dim d1 ON ... AND d1.d_year = 2000
    INNER JOIN web_sales ON ...
    INNER JOIN date_dim d2 ON ...
    WHERE: ss_sales_price / ... BETWEEN 0.76 AND 0.96
    GROUP BY/ORDER BY unchanged
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
