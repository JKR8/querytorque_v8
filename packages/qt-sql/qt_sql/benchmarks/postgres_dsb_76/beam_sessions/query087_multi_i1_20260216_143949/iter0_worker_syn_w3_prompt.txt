## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — materialize_cte
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Builder: Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Apply materialize_cte patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select count(*)
from ((select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from store_sales, date_dim, customer
       where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214+11
         and ss_list_price between 242 and 271
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1955 AND 1961
         and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45
         )
       except
      (select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from catalog_sales, date_dim, customer
       where catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214+11
         and cs_list_price between 242 and 271
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1955 AND 1961
         and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45
         )
       except
      (select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from web_sales, date_dim, customer
       where web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214+11
         and ws_list_price between 242 and 271
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1955 AND 1961
         and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45
         )
) cool_cust
;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: (subquery) cool_cust

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date AS (SELECT * FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1214 AND 1214+11)
  CTE: filtered_customer AS (SELECT * FROM customer WHERE c_birth_year BETWEEN 1955 AND 1961)
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: (
      (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       FROM store_sales
       INNER JOIN filtered_date ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
       INNER JOIN filtered_customer ON store_sales.ss_customer_sk = filtered_customer.c_customer_sk
       WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 242 AND 271
         AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45)
      EXCEPT
      (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       FROM catalog_sales
       INNER JOIN filtered_date ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
       INNER JOIN filtered_customer ON catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = filtered_customer.c_customer_sk
       WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 242 AND 271
         AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45)
      EXCEPT
      (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       FROM web_sales
       INNER JOIN filtered_date ON web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
       INNER JOIN filtered_customer ON web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = filtered_customer.c_customer_sk
       WHERE ws_list_price BETWEEN 242 AND 271
         AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 45)
    ) cool_cust
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
