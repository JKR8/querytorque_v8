## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: C — aggregate_after_item_join
**Hypothesis**: Aggregate sales by item keys after joining store_sales with item. This exploits GROUP BY keys (i_brand_id, etc.) being available early to shrink row count before customer/geo joins, directly targeting the Hash Join (27K rows).

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
  from date_dim, store_sales, item,customer,customer_address,store
  where  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND i_category  = 'Jewelry'
    and d_year=2002
    and d_moy = 4
    and substring(ca_zip,1,5) <> substring(s_zip,1,5)
    and ca_state  = 'IL'
    and c_birth_month = 1
    and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55
 group by i_brand
      ,i_brand_id
      ,i_manufact_id
      ,i_manufact
 order by ext_price desc
         ,i_brand
         ,i_brand_id
         ,i_manufact_id
         ,i_manufact
limit 100 ;
```

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```

```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
