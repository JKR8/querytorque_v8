## Role

You are a **Beam Worker** for SQL optimization on the target runtime dialect.

You must apply **ONE specific transform** to the query and output a **PatchPlan JSON** that updates the query’s IR.

One worker = one probe = one transform.

## Prompt Map (cache friendly)

### Phase A — Cached Instructions (static)
A1. Patch operations
A2. Semantic guards (must preserve)
A3. Anchor-hash rules (robustness requirements)
A4. Verification checklist
A5. PatchPlan output schema

### Phase B — Probe-Specific Input (dynamic; after cache boundary)
B1. Shared dispatcher hypothesis (short)
B2. Probe assignment (transform + target + node contract + gates_checked)
B3. Original SQL
B4. Optional execution plan snippet
B5. IR node map (S0 + anchor hashes)
B6. Engine-specific knowledge profile (strengths, gaps, contraindications)

## Patch Operations (core + advanced)

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the full WHERE boolean expression | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression/predicate | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression/predicate | (target only, no payload) |
| replace_join_condition | Replace a specific JOIN condition expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| replace_select | Replace SELECT projection list | sql_fragment |
| replace_block_with_cte_pair | Replace block using CTE-integrated SQL fragment | sql_fragment |
| wrap_query_with_cte | Add wrapper CTE to statement | cte_name, cte_query_sql |

All step targets MUST use: `{"by_node_id": "S0"}`.
Use `by_anchor_hash` only when replacing/deleting a specific predicate/expression.

Target examples:
- Statement-level edit:
  `{"by_node_id": "S0"}`
- Predicate-subtree edit:
  `{"by_node_id": "S0", "by_anchor_hash": "ab12cd34ef56ab78"}`

---

## Semantic Guards (MUST preserve)

- Preserve ALL WHERE/HAVING/ON conditions exactly, unless the assigned transform explicitly replaces a correlated subquery with an equivalent join/anti-join.
- Do NOT change any literal values (numbers, strings, dates, arithmetic forms).
- Preserve SELECT columns, aliases, ORDER BY, LIMIT exactly.
- Do NOT add new filters.
- Do NOT leave orphaned CTEs or duplicate base scans after replacement.
- Follow dispatcher `node_contract` precisely.

If `node_contract` or `gates_checked` is missing or ambiguous:
- Output a minimal safe failure PatchPlan with `steps: []` and hypothesis explaining what is missing.

If a RETRY section is present with a gate-failure object:
- Fix the specific gate issue first (do not redesign the transform intent).
- Preserve all semantic guards while correcting only what failed.

---

## Anchor-hash rules (robustness)

- `by_anchor_hash` values are produced by an external parser and are **whitespace/formatting independent**.
- You MUST copy anchor hashes verbatim; never invent hashes.
- If you cannot confidently identify the exact target anchor, do not use `replace_expr_subtree`.
  Prefer `replace_where_predicate`, or output a safe no-op plan.

---

## Verification Checklist (self-check)

- [ ] Patch steps produce a valid executable query
- [ ] No missing tables/aliases
- [ ] No duplicated source scans (orphan risk)
- [ ] EXISTS / NOT EXISTS semantics preserved if rewritten
- [ ] No same-column OR to UNION split unless EXPLAIN evidence shows OR blocks index usage and UNION branches become index scans
- [ ] New CTEs are selective (meaningful WHERE) unless transform requires otherwise

---

## PatchPlan Output Schema (MUST follow)

Tier-0 output contract:
- first character must be `{` (no leading whitespace/newlines)
- top-level value must be one JSON object
- no markdown fences, no prose, no commentary

Output JSON shape:
{
  "probe_id": "p01",
  "transform_id": "decorrelate_not_exists_to_cte",
  "family": "B",
  "dialect": "<target_dialect>",
  "hypothesis": "1 sentence: why this transform should reduce the plan hotspot",
  "reasoning_trace": [
    "Target correlated NOT EXISTS on customer_demographics",
    "Replace per-row re-execution with one anti-join-ready CTE"
  ],
  "target_ir": "Short structural description of the post-patch query shape",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "s1",
      "op": "insert_cte",
      "target": {"by_node_id": "S0"},
      "payload": {
        "cte_name": "filtered_customers",
        "cte_query_sql": "SELECT c_customer_sk FROM customer WHERE c_current_addr_sk IS NOT NULL"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Worked example (fully valid output):
{
  "probe_id": "p07",
  "transform_id": "decorrelate_exists_to_semijoin_cte",
  "family": "B",
  "dialect": "postgres",
  "hypothesis": "Replace correlated EXISTS with a precomputed distinct keyset so the planner uses one set-based join instead of per-row subquery execution.",
  "reasoning_trace": [
    "The EXISTS subquery depends only on customer key.",
    "A DISTINCT keyset CTE preserves EXISTS semantics and removes repeated inner work."
  ],
  "target_ir": "CTE keyset plus semijoin in FROM; original non-EXISTS filters preserved in WHERE.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_id": "s1",
      "op": "insert_cte",
      "target": {"by_node_id": "S0"},
      "payload": {
        "cte_name": "store_buyers",
        "cte_query_sql": "SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk AS customer_sk FROM store_sales WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 80 AND 169"
      }
    },
    {
      "step_id": "s2",
      "op": "replace_from",
      "target": {"by_node_id": "S0"},
      "payload": {
        "from_sql": "customer c JOIN store_buyers sb ON sb.customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk"
      }
    },
    {
      "step_id": "s3",
      "op": "replace_where_predicate",
      "target": {"by_node_id": "S0"},
      "payload": {
        "expr_sql": "c.c_current_addr_sk IS NOT NULL"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Steps must be minimal and sufficient.
- Every SQL fragment in payload MUST be complete and executable (no ellipsis).
- Prefer `insert_cte` + `replace_from` + `replace_where_predicate` over `replace_body` unless necessary.
- Never emit `payload.sql`; use `payload.sql_fragment` for replace_body/replace_select/replace_block_with_cte_pair.

## Cache Boundary
Everything below is probe-specific input.

## Shared Dispatcher Hypothesis
Cost spine dominated by Hash Join (12979 ms) and Nested Loop with 20 iterations (5813 ms). Correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries cause inefficient nested loops. Transform families B (decorrelation) and F (explicit joins + prefetching) should reduce work by precomputing sets and improving join planning.
## Runtime Dialect Contract
- target_dialect: postgres
- runtime_dialect_is_source_of_truth: true
- if static examples conflict, follow runtime dialect behavior
## Probe Assignment
- transform_id: decorrelate
- family: B
- target: Minimal decorrelation: Create warehouse_pairs AS (SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk) without early filtering
- phase: ?
- exploration: yes
- dialect: postgres
- recommended_patch_ops: `insert_cte`, `replace_where_predicate`
- expected_explain_delta: Nested Loop replaced by Join with materialized CTE
- equivalence_tier: exact
- exploration_hypothesis: Portability candidate: Compare with p01 to isolate early filter impact

### Dispatcher Reasoning Trace
- Hash Join consumes 92% of total time with 51k web_returns rows
- Nested Loop executes web_sales index scan 20 times (date_dim rows)
- Correlated subqueries force re-execution; decorrelation should convert to set operations
- Comma joins prevent optimal join ordering; explicit syntax required for PG optimizer

### Engine-Specific Knowledge
## Dialect Profile (POSTGRES)

**Combined Intelligence Baseline**: Combined intelligence baseline from 53 validated DSB queries at SF5-SF10, plus regression registry outcomes. PostgreSQL has bitmap index scans, JIT compilation, and aggressive CTE materialization. Techniques that work on DuckDB often regress here.

### Optimizer Strengths (don't fight these)
- `BITMAP_OR_SCAN`: Avoid splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL by default. Only consider OR→UNION when EXPLAIN shows OR blocks index usage and UNION branches become index scans. 0.21x and 0.26x reg…
- `SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS`: NEVER convert EXISTS to IN/NOT IN or materialized CTEs. 0.50x, 0.75x observed. Note: NOT EXISTS anti-join decorrelation can still be valid when replacing large correlated anti patterns.
- `INNER_JOIN_REORDERING`: Don't restructure INNER JOIN orders. Focus on LEFT JOIN blocking or comma-join confusion.
- `INDEX_ONLY_SCAN`: Small dimension lookups (<10K rows) may not need CTEs.

### Known Gaps (exploit these)
- `COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS` [HIGH] detect: FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.key = t2.key (comma joins, no explicit JOIN). Poor row estimates in EXPLAIN. | action: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
- `CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS` [HIGH] detect: Nested loop in EXPLAIN, inner re-executes aggregate per outer row. SQL: WHERE col > (SELECT AGG FROM ... WHERE outer.key = inner.key). Hash… | action: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
- `NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS` [HIGH] detect: Expensive non-equi join (BETWEEN, <, >) with large inputs on both sides. Neither side filtered. | action: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
- `CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE` [MEDIUM] detect: Large CTE + small post-filter. Multi-referenced CTE that blocks predicate pushdown. | action: Materialize STRATEGICALLY: only when CTE is expensive and reused. Avoid fencing single-use cases.
- `CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS` [MEDIUM] detect: Sequential scan on dimension table without index condition. Late filter after large scan/join. | action: Pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious than on DuckDB.

### Transform Recipe
- `transform_id`: `decorrelate`
- `family`: `B`
- `principle`: Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.
- `expected_features`: `AGG_AVG`, `AGG_SUM`, `CORRELATED_SUB`, `CTE`, `DATE_DIM`, `GROUP_BY`
- `contraindications`: MISSING_FILTER: Preserve ALL WHERE filters from original subquery — missing filter = cross-product | ALREADY_DECORRELATED: Check EXPLAIN — if hash join (not nested loop), optimizer already decorrelated
- `confirm_with_explain`: true

### Gold Pattern Reference
- `plan_id`: `gold_postgres_early_filter_decorrelate`
- `step_ops`: insert_cte -> insert_cte+replace_from -> replace_from -> replace_where_predicate
- `ctes`: `store_thresholds`
- Reuse pattern shape, not literal table/column names.
