## Role

You are **W2 "Unnester"** — Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Eliminate per-row re-execution: convert correlated subqueries to GROUP BY CTEs, push aggregation before joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: B — decorrelate_max_store_sales
**Hypothesis**: max_store_sales scalar subquery in HAVING forces per-row execution. Decorrelating via standalone CTE join (B) eliminates 147k-row Gather Merge (3067ms). Best_ss_customer's 4167ms CTE Scan suggests correlation overhead.

  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 via anchor_hash e2efc842d5bebfd9 (best_ss_customer's HAVING subquery) → join with max_store_sales
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
