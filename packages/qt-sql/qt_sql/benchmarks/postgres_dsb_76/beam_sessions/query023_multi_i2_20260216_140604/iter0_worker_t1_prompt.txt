## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — materialization_prefetch
**Hypothesis**: CTEs best_ss_customer (4.1s) and frequent_ss_items are evaluated twice due to UNION ALL branches, causing redundant computation.

## Original SQL

```sql

    and i_manager_id BETWEEN 44 and 63
     AND i_category IN ('Men', 'Music', 'Sports')

```

## Current IR Node Map

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: frequent_ss_items  (unchanged)
  CTE: max_store_sales  (unchanged)
  CTE: best_ss_customer  (unchanged)
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    WITH main_sales AS (
        SELECT cs_quantity * cs_list_price AS sales, cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_item_sk, cs_wholesale_cost
        FROM catalog_sales
        JOIN date_dim ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 1999 AND d_moy = 5
        UNION ALL
        SELECT ws_quantity * ws_list_price, ws_bill_customer_sk, ws_item_sk, ws_wholesale_cost

      AND cs_bill_customer_sk IN (SELECT c_customer_sk FROM best_ss_customer)
    LIMIT 100
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
