## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filtering_with_ctes
**Hypothesis**: Pushing filters on item (category, manager_id) and date_dim (date range) into CTEs reduces rows early before joining with catalog_sales, minimizing data processed in subsequent joins.

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
   w_state
  ,i_item_id
  ,sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) < cast ('2002-02-19' as date))
 		then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_before
  ,sum(case when (cast(d_date as date) >= cast ('2002-02-19' as date))
 		then cs_sales_price - coalesce(cr_refunded_cash,0) else 0 end) as sales_after
 from
   catalog_sales left outer join catalog_returns on
       (cs_order_number = cr_order_number
        and cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)
  ,warehouse
  ,item
  ,date_dim
 where
 i_item_sk          = cs_item_sk
 and cs_warehouse_sk    = w_warehouse_sk
 and cs_sold_date_sk    = d_date_sk
 and d_date between  (cast ('2002-02-19' as date) - interval '30 day')
                and (cast ('2002-02-19' as date) + interval '30 day') 
 and i_category  = 'Jewelry'
 and i_manager_id between 61 and 100
 and cs_wholesale_cost between 42 and 61
 and cr_reason_sk = 33
 group by
    w_state,i_item_id
 order by w_state,i_item_id
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, catalog_returns, warehouse, item, date_dim
    WHERE [90046ef2acd680cd]: i_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk AND cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d...
    GROUP BY: w_state, i_item_id
    ORDER BY: w_state, i_item_id

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date (via Q1)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN (cast('2002-02-19' as date) - interval '30 day') AND (cast('2002-02-19' as date) + interval '30 day')
  CTE: filtered_item (via Q2)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category = 'Jewelry' AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 61 AND 100
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales
      LEFT JOIN catalog_returns ON (cs_order_number = cr_order_number AND cs_item_sk = cr_item_sk)
      INNER JOIN filtered_item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      INNER JOIN warehouse ON cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
    WHERE: cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 42 AND 61 AND cr_reason_sk = 33
    GROUP BY: w_state, i_item_id
    ORDER BY: w_state, i_item_id
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
