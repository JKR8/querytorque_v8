## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: B+E — decorrelate_subquery_with_prefilter
**Hypothesis**: The correlated subquery (Family B) causes per-row re-execution of the AVG() scan. Pre-filter web_sales/date_dim (Family E) via CTE to reduce rows scanned in both main query and subquery. Fix t1's literal preservation error by retaining 76*0.01/91*0.01 syntax.

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
   sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)  as "Excess Discount Amount"
from
    web_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id BETWEEN 797 and 996
or i_category IN ('Men', 'Shoes', 'Sports'))
and i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-01-29' and
        cast('1999-01-29' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55
and ws_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         SELECT
            1.3 * avg(ws_ext_discount_amt)
         FROM
            web_sales
           ,date_dim
         WHERE
              ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '1999-01-29' and
                             cast('1999-01-29' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
          and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55
          and ws_sales_price / ws_list_price BETWEEN 76 * 0.01 AND 91 * 0.01
  )
order by sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: web_sales, item, date_dim
    WHERE [7274e57af0a5eb74]: (i_manufact_id BETWEEN 797 AND 996 OR i_category IN ('Men', 'Shoes', 'Sports')) AND i_item_sk = w...
    ORDER BY: SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0: Replace the correlated subquery with a thresholds CTE (decorrelated) + precompute filtered web_sales/date_dim. Anchor WHERE conditions must retain original 76*0.01 literals.
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
