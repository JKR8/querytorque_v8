Based on the analysis of the query, execution plans, and optimization history, the primary bottleneck is the correlated subquery causing repeated execution per outer row. The best-performing approach so far is `syn_w1_rescue` (A+B) with a 40.925ms execution time, which decorrelates the subquery and prefilters dimension tables. However, the most expensive remaining operator is the threshold computation's `Aggregate` (30.664ms) over 1688 rows.

### Step 1: EXPLAIN Plan Analysis
**syn_w1_rescue (A+B) - WINNER**  
- **Improved operator**: Eliminated correlated subquery execution (no `DELIM_SCAN` in plan).  
  **Structural change**: Decorrelated subquery via standalone CTE with GROUP BY.  
  **Most expensive remaining operator**:  
  `Aggregate (rows=824, time=30.664)` in threshold computation.  

**t2_refine (F) - REGRESSION (8655.793ms)**  
- **Worse operator**:  
  `Hash Join (rows=2067, time=8654.124)`  
  **Why**: Correlated subquery (`web_sales_1` index scan) re-executed per outer row (13441 rows).  

**Classification**: `syn_w1_rescue` is COMPLEMENTARY to other families since it fixes correlation but leaves threshold computation expensive.

### Step 2: Target Design
**Primary Target (Refinement)**  
Refine `syn_w1_rescue` by pushing item filters into `common_scan` CTE to reduce rows fed to the expensive threshold aggregation.  
```json
{
  "family": "A+E",
  "transform": "push_item_filter_into_common_scan",
  "target_id": "t3",
  "relevance_score": 0.95,
  "hypothesis": "Filtering items early in common_scan CTE reduces input rows to threshold computation's Aggregate (currently 1688 rows). This targets the 30.664ms operator.",
  "target_ir": "S0: by_anchor_hash(7274e57af0a5eb74) [item condition] + common_scan CTE",
  "recommended_examples": ["early_filter", "multi_dimension_prefetch"]
}
```

**Rationale**:  
- The `common_scan` CTE (1688 rows) feeds the expensive `Aggregate` in threshold computation.  
- Pushing `filtered_items` into `common_scan` via join (Family A+E) reduces rows before aggregation.  
- High confidence: Row count reduction directly targets the slowest operator in the winning plan.
