## Analysis

**Family A (Early Filtering)**: MEDIUM  
Predicates on date_dim and web_sales could be pushed earlier, but the correlated subquery remains the dominant bottleneck. Early filtering alone won't resolve the per-row re-execution.

**Family B (Decorrelation)**: HIGH  
The correlated subquery forces re-scanning web_sales/date_dim per item. Decorrelation via shared CTE with precomputed thresholds is the most impactful optimization.

**Family C (Aggregation Pushdown)**: LOW  
No GROUP BY in main query. The subquery's aggregation is already pushed to per-item level, but correlation prevents efficient execution.

**Family D (Set Operation Optimization)**: LOW  
Query lacks INTERSECT/UNION patterns. EXISTS/NOT EXISTS transformations don't apply to this scalar subquery structure.

**Family E (Materialization/Prefetch)**: HIGH  
Identical date_dim/web_sales scans occur in main query and subquery. Materializing a base scan CTE avoids redundant processing.

**Family F (Join Transform)**: MEDIUM  
Implicit comma joins obscure join dependencies. Explicit INNER JOINs improve readability and optimizer control, especially when combined with CTEs.

**Chosen families**: [B, E, F]  
**Confidence**: High (B/E), Medium (F)
