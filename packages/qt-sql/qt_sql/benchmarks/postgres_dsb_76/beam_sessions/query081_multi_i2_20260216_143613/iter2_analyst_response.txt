Based on the analysis, the primary bottleneck is the correlated subquery in the WHERE clause (anchor hash `dff2117ecbdb3fa4`), which forces per-row re-execution. The failed patch (t2_plus) had a sound structural approach combining decorrelation (Family B) and explicit joins (Family F) but failed due to incorrect join conditions. Here are the refined targets:

### Step 1: EXPLAIN Plan Analysis
No winners exist yet (only 1 FAIL). The failed patch had a semantic error in join conditions but correctly targeted decorrelation.

### Key Rationale
1. **Primary Target (rescue_decorrelate)**: Fixes the failed patch's join condition (`c_current_addr_sk` → `c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk`) while preserving decorrelation + explicit joins. Directly eliminates the correlated subquery bottleneck.
2. **Secondary (decorrelate_materialize)**: Combines decorrelation with CTE materialization to avoid duplicate base table scans.
3. **Tertiary (early_filter_date)**: Pushes `d_year=2002` filter earlier as a low-risk optimization. Uses Family A since dimension tables benefit from early filtering.

### Optimization Families Used
- **B (Decorrelation)**: Critical for eliminating correlated subquery.
- **F (Join Transform)**: Fixes implicit cross joins and incorrect join conditions.
- **E (Materialization)**: Prevents recomputation of CTE aggregates.
- **A (Early Filtering)**: Reduces date_dim scan size.

### Skipped Families
- **C (Agg Pushdown)**: Not applicable (GROUP BY keys ≠ join keys).
- **D (Set Ops)**: No INTERSECT/UNION patterns.
