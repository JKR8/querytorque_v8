## Role

You are **W2 "Unnester"** — Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Eliminate per-row re-execution: convert correlated subqueries to GROUP BY CTEs, push aggregation before joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: C — aggregate_before_dimension_join
**Hypothesis**: GROUP BY keys map to dimension tables. Aggregating catalog_sales by foreign keys + date filters before joining to dimensions reduces rows 100x (25k → ~250 groups), minimizing expensive string operations in final GROUP BY.

## Original SQL

  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and

| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
