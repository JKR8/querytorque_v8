## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — push_dimension_filters
**Hypothesis**: Filters on dimension tables (warehouse/ship_mode/call_center) are applied late. Extracting them as CTEs with WHERE clauses enables predicate pushdown into catalog_sales joins.

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, warehouse, ship_mode, call_center, date_dim
    WHERE [d8eb84395846e3bc]: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1191 AND 1191 + 23 AND cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_warehouse_sk = w_wa...
    GROUP BY: SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name
    ORDER BY: SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_warehouse (via Q1)
    FROM: warehouse
    WHERE: w_gmt_offset = -5
  CTE: filtered_ship_mode (via Q2)
    FROM: ship_mode
    WHERE: sm_type = 'LIBRARY'
  CTE: filtered_call_center (via Q3)
    FROM: call_center
    WHERE: cc_class = 'medium'
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, filtered_warehouse, filtered_ship_mode, filtered_call_center, date_dim
    WHERE: cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk
      AND cs_ship_mode_sk = sm_ship_mode_sk
      AND cs_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
      AND cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
      AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1191 AND 1191+23
      AND cs_list_price BETWEEN 244 AND 273
    GROUP BY: SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name
    ORDER BY: SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name FROM 1 FOR 20), sm_type, cc_name
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
