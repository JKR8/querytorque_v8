## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Reducer: Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Apply early_filter patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (184, 307, 365, 560, 681)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 and 71)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '2001-02-23' and
        cast('2001-02-23' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '2001-02-23' and
                             cast('2001-02-23' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 115 and 144
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 21 * 0.01 AND 41 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, item, date_dim
    WHERE [46ed3cc4a4ef22ce]: (i_manufact_id IN (184, 307, 365, 560, 681) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71) AND i_item_sk = cs...
    ORDER BY: SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: item_filter (via Q_ITEM)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: (i_manufact_id IN (184,307,365,560,681) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71)
  CTE: date_filter (via Q_DATE)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN '2001-02-23' AND '2001-02-23'::date + 90 days
  CTE: threshold (via Q_THRESHOLD)
    FROM: catalog_sales
    JOIN date_filter ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE: cs_list_price BETWEEN 115 AND 144
      AND cs_sales_price/cs_list_price BETWEEN 0.21 AND 0.41
    GROUP BY cs_item_sk
    SELECT: cs_item_sk, 1.3*AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_MAIN)
    FROM: catalog_sales
    JOIN item_filter ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
    JOIN date_filter ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
    JOIN threshold ON cs_item_sk = threshold.cs_item_sk
    WHERE: cs_ext_discount_amt > threshold.threshold
    ORDER BY: SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)
    LIMIT 100
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
