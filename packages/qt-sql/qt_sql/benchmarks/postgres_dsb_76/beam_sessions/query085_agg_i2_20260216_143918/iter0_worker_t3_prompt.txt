## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — shared_dimension_scan
**Hypothesis**: Repeated scans of customer_demographics (cd1/cd2) with identical filters waste resources. Materialize once in a CTE and reuse.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: web_sales, web_returns, web_page, customer_demographics cd1, customer_demographics cd2, customer_address, date_dim, reason

    GROUP BY: r_reason_desc
    ORDER BY: SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc FROM 1 FOR 20), AVG(ws_quantity), AVG(wr_refunded_cash), AVG(wr_fee)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```

  CTE: cd_filtered (via Q1)
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    FROM customer_demographics

  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: date_dim
      INNER JOIN web_sales ON (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2002)

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
