### Analysis of Execution Plans

All patches in Iteration 1 **FAILED** due to literal mismatch (replaced `10+2` with `12`). There are no winners to analyze. The primary bottleneck remains the top-level `Nested Loop` (rows=964, time=27374.327 ms) in the original plan, which processes the anti-join for `catalog_sales`. This operator:
1. Scans 310,812 materialized rows from `catalog_sales` for each row from the first subplan (1105 rows)
2. Causes a combinatorial explosion (~343M row checks) due to nested loop anti-join semantics
3. Dominates 27.3s of the total 27.4s runtime

Secondary bottlenecks:
- `Nested Loop` for `web_sales` anti-join (rows=1105, time=6326.222 ms)
- Repeated full scans of `date_dim` (3x) despite small cardinality

### Key Rationale
1. **Primary Target (B+E)**: Directly attacks the 27.3s bottleneck by converting anti-joins to hash joins. Combines proven decorrelation (B) with date reuse (E). Preserves `10+2` expression.
2. **Fallback Target (A)**: Early filtering reduces rows entering expensive anti-joins. Proven 1.08x gain in prior run.
3. **Conservative Target (B)**: Partial decorrelation minimizes rewrite risk while optimizing the EXISTS scan.
4. **Safe Target (E)**: Isolated date prefetch avoids literal mismatch issues while optimizing repeat scans.

**Quality Focus**: All targets preserve `10+2` literals and target EXPLAIN-verified bottlenecks. No speculative optimizations.
