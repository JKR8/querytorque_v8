## Analysis
- **Family A (Early Filtering)**: MEDIUM. Dimension filters exist but aren't maximally pushed into scans. Could reduce rows before joins.
- **Family B (Decorrelation)**: HIGH. Correlated subqueries are primary bottleneck, causing per-row re-execution (Nested Loop in plan).
- **Family C (Aggregation Pushdown)**: LOW. No aggregation opportunities before final GROUP BY since subqueries are existence checks.
- **Family D (Set Operation Optimization)**: MEDIUM. NOT EXISTS could be rewritten as anti-join but decorrelation is superior.
- **Family E (Materialization)**: HIGH. Repeated date_dim scans with identical filters (3x) are clear optimization target.
- **Family F (Join Transform)**: MEDIUM. Implicit joins obscure join order; explicit joins enable better predicate pushdown.

**Chosen families**: B, E, F, A  
**Confidence**: High (B/E), Medium (F/A)  
**Rationale**: Decorrelation (B) addresses the primary bottleneck of correlated subqueries. Materialization (E) eliminates redundant date_dim scans. Join restructuring (F) and early filtering (A) provide complementary optimizations for dimension table processing.
