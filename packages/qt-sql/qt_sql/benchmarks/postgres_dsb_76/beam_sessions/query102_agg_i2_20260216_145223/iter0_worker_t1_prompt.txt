## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filtering
**Hypothesis**: Late-applied dimension table filters (item, customer_address, date_dim) cause unnecessary row inflation in joins. Pushing filters into CTEs reduces join cardinality early.

## Original SQL

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
