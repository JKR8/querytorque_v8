## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter_web_sales_with_d2_dates
**Hypothesis**: Pre-filter web_sales using a precomputed set of d2 dates (within 2001 and 2001+30 days) to reduce Seq Scan rows from 220K. Targets the bottleneck in t1_rescue's plan.

## Current IR Node Map

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0: insert_cte('filtered_d2_dates', 'SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_date BETWEEN (SELECT MIN(d_date) FROM filtered_d1_dates) AND (SELECT MAX(d_date) FROM filtered_d1_dates) + INTERVAL ''30 DAY'''), then replace_expr_subtree(by_anchor_hash: [hash of filtered_web_sales body], 'SELECT * FROM web_sales WHERE ...', 'SELECT ws.* FROM web_sales ws JOIN filtered_d2_dates d2 ON ws.ws_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk WHERE ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55')
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
