## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filtering
**Hypothesis**: Late-applied filters on date_dim, item, and customer_address cause large intermediate joins. Pushing filters into CTEs reduces cardinality before expensive joins.

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
    cd_gender,
    cd_marital_status,
    cd_education_status,
    hd_vehicle_count,
    count(*) as cnt

    web_sales,

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_d1 (via Q1)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_year = 2001
  CTE: filtered_item (via Q2)
    FROM: item

      AND i_manager_id IN (21,22,38,39,46,47,66,67,74,93)
  CTE: filtered_ca (via Q3)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_state IN ('AZ','KS','OH','TX','WA')
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: store_sales
      INNER JOIN filtered_d1 d1 ON ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_item i ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN web_sales ws ON ws_item_sk = i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN date_dim d2 ON ws_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
      INNER JOIN customer c ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_ca ca ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
      ... (other joins)
    WHERE: d2.d_date BETWEEN d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + interval '30 day')
      AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55
    GROUP BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, hd_vehicle_count
    ORDER BY: cnt
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
