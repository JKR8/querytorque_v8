## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filtering
**Hypothesis**: Sequential scan on catalog_returns (719k rows) processes unnecessary data. Dimension filters (date_dim:28 rows, call_center:24 rows) should be pushed into CTEs first to reduce fact table joins.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  
        cc_call_center_id Call_Center,
        cc_name Call_Center_Name,
        cc_manager Manager,
        sum(cr_net_loss) Returns_Loss
from
        call_center,
        catalog_returns,
        date_dim,
        customer,
        customer_address,
        customer_demographics,
        household_demographics
where
        cr_call_center_sk       = cc_call_center_sk
and     cr_returned_date_sk     = d_date_sk
and     cr_returning_customer_sk= c_customer_sk
and     cd_demo_sk              = c_current_cdemo_sk
and     hd_demo_sk              = c_current_hdemo_sk
and     ca_address_sk           = c_current_addr_sk
and     d_year                  = 1998 
and     d_moy                   = 2
and     ( (cd_marital_status       = 'M' and cd_education_status     = 'Unknown')
        or(cd_marital_status       = 'W' and cd_education_status     = 'Advanced Degree'))
and     hd_buy_potential like '1001-5000%'
and     ca_gmt_offset           = -7
group by cc_call_center_id,cc_name,cc_manager,cd_marital_status,cd_education_status
order by sum(cr_net_loss) desc;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
    WHERE [ac46b9a793b959c6]: cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cr_returning_custom...
    GROUP BY: cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    ORDER BY: SUM(cr_net_loss)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date (via Q1)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 2
  CTE: filtered_call_center (via Q2)
    FROM: call_center
  CTE: filtered_demographics (via Q3)
    FROM: customer_demographics
    WHERE: (cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown') OR (cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
  CTE: filtered_household (via Q4)
    FROM: household_demographics
    WHERE: hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
  CTE: filtered_address (via Q5)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_gmt_offset = -7
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_returns
    JOIN: filtered_date ON cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN: filtered_call_center ON cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
    JOIN: customer ON cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN: filtered_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
    JOIN: filtered_household ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
    JOIN: filtered_address ON ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
    GROUP BY: cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
    ORDER BY: SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
