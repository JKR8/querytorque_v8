### Step 1 — Compare EXPLAIN Plans  
All patches in Iteration 0 **FAILED**, so there are no winners to analyze. The primary failure reason was semantic errors in CTE definitions (missing columns in GROUP BY). No operator improvements were observed.  

---

### Step 2 — Design Targets  
**Primary Bottleneck**: Sequential scan on `catalog_returns` (69.925 ms, 719k rows) dominates runtime. Secondary issues:  
- Nested loops over dimension tables (`customer`, `household_demographics`, etc.)  
- Filters applied late on dimension tables (`date_dim`, `customer_demographics`)  

**Target Design Rationale**:  
1. **Rescue Family A (Early Filtering)** with corrected CTEs to include all required columns.  
2. **Combine Families A+F** to push filters into CTEs *and* restructure joins explicitly.  
3. **Refine Family C (Aggregation Pushdown)** to target the `catalog_returns` scan.  
4. **Novel Pre-join** to collapse dimension tables early.  

**Targets** (prioritized):
