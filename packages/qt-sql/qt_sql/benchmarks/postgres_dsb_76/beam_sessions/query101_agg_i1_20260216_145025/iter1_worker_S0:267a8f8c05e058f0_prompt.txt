## Role

You are **W2 "Unnester"** — Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Eliminate per-row re-execution: convert correlated subqueries to GROUP BY CTEs, push aggregation before joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: C — agg_pushdown_before_joins
**Hypothesis**: Push COUNT(*) to store_sales early (keys: ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk) since GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys. Reduces rows fed into Nested Loop (15896 rows, 842 ms).

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, count(*) as cnt
FROM
store_sales,
store_returns,
web_sales,
date_dim d1,
date_dim d2,
item,
customer,
customer_address,
household_demographics
WHERE
ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
AND ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk
AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
AND c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk
AND sr_item_sk = ws_item_sk
AND i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
AND i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music')
AND sr_returned_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
AND ws_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
AND d2.d_date between d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + interval '90 day')
AND ca_state in ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX')
AND d1.d_year = 1998
AND hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13
AND hd_buy_potential = '0-500'
AND ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 35 * 0.01 AND 55 * 0.01
GROUP BY c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name
ORDER BY cnt
;
```

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0:267a8f8c05e058f0
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
