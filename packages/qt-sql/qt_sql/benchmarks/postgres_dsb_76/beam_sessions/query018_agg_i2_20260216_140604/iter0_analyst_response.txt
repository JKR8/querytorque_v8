## Analysis

### Family Relevance:
- **A: Early Filtering (Predicate Pushback)**: HIGH  
  Multiple late-applied dimension filters (customer_demographics, customer, customer_address) could be pushed into CTEs to reduce join cardinality early.
- **B: Decorrelation (Sets Over Loops)**: LOW  
  No correlated subqueries exist in the query structure.
- **C: Aggregation Pushdown**: MEDIUM  
  GROUP BY keys (i_item_id, ca_*) span multiple tables, making full pushdown infeasible. Partial pre-aggregation on catalog_sales keys might be possible.
- **D: Set Operation Optimization**: LOW  
  No INTERSECT/UNION operations present.
- **E: Materialization/Prefetch**: HIGH  
  Repeated dimension scans (customer→address) and expensive filters (date_dim→catalog_sales) could benefit from pre-materialization.
- **F: Join Transform**: HIGH  
  Implicit comma joins obscure join order control. Restructuring to explicit joins with filtered dimension CTEs would optimize predicate pushdown.

**Chosen families**: [A, E, F]  
**Confidence**: High (Plan shows nested loops with 135K intermediate rows from date_dim→catalog_sales, followed by dimension rescans)
