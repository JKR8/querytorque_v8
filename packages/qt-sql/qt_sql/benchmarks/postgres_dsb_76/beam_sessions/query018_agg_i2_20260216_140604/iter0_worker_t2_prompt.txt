## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — predicate_pushdown
**Hypothesis**: Filters on customer_demographics (gender/education) and customer_address (state) are applied late. Pushing them into CTEs reduces nested loop probes.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_item_id,
        ca_country,
        ca_state,
        ca_county,
        avg( cast(cs_quantity as decimal(12,2))) agg1,
        avg( cast(cs_list_price as decimal(12,2))) agg2,
        avg( cast(cs_coupon_amt as decimal(12,2))) agg3,
        avg( cast(cs_sales_price as decimal(12,2))) agg4,
        avg( cast(cs_net_profit as decimal(12,2))) agg5,
        avg( cast(c_birth_year as decimal(12,2))) agg6
from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
      cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
      cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
      cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk and
      cd_gender = 'F' and
      cd_education_status = '4 yr Degree' and
      c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk and
      d_year = 1999 and
      c_birth_month = 12 and
      ca_state in ('AR', 'IN', 'VA')
      and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 10
      AND i_category = 'Music'
 group by rollup (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
 order by ca_country,
        ca_state,
        ca_county,
	i_item_id
 limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, customer_demographics, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
    WHERE [19e03965dd438c15]: cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_b...
    ORDER BY: ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: prefiltered_demo (via Q1)
    FROM: customer_demographics
    WHERE: cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_education_status = '4 yr Degree'
  CTE: prefiltered_addr (via Q2)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_state IN ('AR', 'IN', 'VA')
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, prefiltered_demo, customer, prefiltered_addr, date_dim, item
    WHERE: cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
      AND cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
      AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
      AND d_year = 1999
      AND c_birth_month = 12
      AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 10
      AND i_category = 'Music'
    GROUP BY: rollup (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
    ORDER BY: ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
