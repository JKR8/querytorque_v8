## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: F — join_restructure_materialized
**Hypothesis**: Implicit joins force suboptimal join order. Materializing filtered dimensions first and restructuring joins reduces intermediate rows from 135K.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_item_id,
        ca_country,
        ca_state,
        ca_county,
        avg( cast(cs_quantity as decimal(12,2))) agg1,
        avg( cast(cs_list_price as decimal(12,2))) agg2,
        avg( cast(cs_coupon_amt as decimal(12,2))) agg3,
        avg( cast(cs_sales_price as decimal(12,2))) agg4,
        avg( cast(cs_net_profit as decimal(12,2))) agg5,
        avg( cast(c_birth_year as decimal(12,2))) agg6
from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
      cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
      cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
      cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk and
      cd_gender = 'F' and
      cd_education_status = '4 yr Degree' and

      AND i_category = 'Music'
 group by rollup (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
 order by ca_country,

```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, customer_demographics, customer, customer_address, date_dim, item
    WHERE [19e03965dd438c15]: cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_b...
    ORDER BY: ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date (via Q1)
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_year = 1999
  CTE: filtered_item (via Q2)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category = 'Music'
  CTE: filtered_demo (via Q3)
    FROM: customer_demographics
    WHERE: cd_gender = 'F' AND cd_education_status = '4 yr Degree'
  CTE: filtered_addr (via Q4)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_state IN ('AR', 'IN', 'VA')
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_sales
      INNER JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_item ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_demo ON cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
      INNER JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
      INNER JOIN filtered_addr ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE: cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 5 AND 10
      AND c_birth_month = 12
    GROUP BY: rollup (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county)
    ORDER BY: ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, i_item_id
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
