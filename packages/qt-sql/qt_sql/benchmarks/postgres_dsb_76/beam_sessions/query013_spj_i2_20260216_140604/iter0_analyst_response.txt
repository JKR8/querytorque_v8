### Analysis of Optimization Families

**Family A (Early Filtering)**: HIGH relevance  
The query applies multiple dimension table filters (date_dim.d_year, customer_demographics attributes, household_demographics.hd_dep_count, customer_address attributes) that could be pushed earlier to reduce join cardinality. The execution plan shows sequential scans on dimension tables after joining with large fact tables.

**Family B (Decorrelation)**: LOW relevance  
No correlated subqueries exist in the original query. All joins are standard equi-joins without per-row re-execution patterns.

**Family C (Aggregation Pushdown)**: MEDIUM relevance  
While the final aggregation is a simple MIN(), the intermediate join result size (168K+ rows) significantly exceeds the final output (1 row). Pre-aggregation isn't directly applicable since MIN() requires full scan, but pre-filtering could reduce input size.

**Family D (Set Operation Optimization)**: HIGH relevance  
The complex OR conditions create implicit set operations. The execution plan shows nested loops (rows=2940) for OR branches, indicating materialization inefficiencies.

**Family E (Materialization/Prefetch)**: HIGH relevance  
Repeated dimension table scans (customer_demographics, customer_address) in OR branches suggest reuse opportunities. The plan shows separate Index Scans for these dimensions.

**Family F (Join Transform)**: HIGH relevance  
Comma-joined tables with complex WHERE conditions prevent optimal join ordering. The plan shows a hash join between large intermediate results (18K+ rows) before applying dimension filters.

**Chosen families**: E, D, F, A  
**Confidence**: High (All families address observable plan bottlenecks)
