## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — push_dimension_filters
**Hypothesis**: Filters on store (s_state) and item (i_manager_id) are applied late. Pushing them into the base CTE via joins reduces fact table rows early, leveraging selective dimensions (store: 0.0001% of table).

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
 	from
 	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
 		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
 		from store_sales, date_dim
 		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1215 and 1215+11
    and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 79 * 0.01 AND 89 * 0.01
 		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
 	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
 	from store_sales, date_dim
 	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1215 and 1215+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 79 * 0.01 AND 89 * 0.01
 	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 10 and 14
       and s_state in ('KS','OH','SD')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: store, item, (subquery) sb, (subquery) sc
    WHERE [df5a282da9a18886]: sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk AND sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave AND s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk AN...
    ORDER BY: s_store_name, i_item_desc

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: base (via Q_base)
    FROM: store_sales
      INNER JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
      INNER JOIN store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
      INNER JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
    WHERE: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1215 AND 1215+11
           AND ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.79 AND 0.89
           AND s_state IN ('KS','OH','SD')
           AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 10 AND 14
    GROUP BY: ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
    SELECT: ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue
  CTE: sb (via Q_sb)
    FROM: base
    GROUP BY: ss_store_sk
    SELECT: ss_store_sk, AVG(revenue) AS ave
  CTE: sc (via Q_sc)
    FROM: base
    SELECT: ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, revenue
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_main)
    FROM: sb
      INNER JOIN sc ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
      INNER JOIN store ON s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk
      INNER JOIN item ON i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
    WHERE: sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave
    ORDER BY: s_store_name, i_item_desc
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
