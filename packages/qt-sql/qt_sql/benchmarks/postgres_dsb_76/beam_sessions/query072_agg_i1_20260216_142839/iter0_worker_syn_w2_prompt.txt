## Role

You are **W2 "Unnester"** — Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Eliminate per-row re-execution: convert correlated subqueries to GROUP BY CTEs, push aggregation before joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: B — decorrelate
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Unnester: Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Apply decorrelate patterns to the query.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, inventory, warehouse, item, customer_demographics, household_demographics, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3, promotion, catalog_returns
    WHERE [caca0908ce6d7a53]: d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + ...
    GROUP BY: i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
    ORDER BY: total_cnt, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
