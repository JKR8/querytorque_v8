## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — rescue_dimension_prefetch
**Hypothesis**: Patch t4 failed due to a column alias error (c_current_cdemo_sk vs cd_demo_sk). Fix the JOIN condition in customer_demographics_filtered to reference the correct alias (cd_demo_sk) while preserving dimension prefetching. This would reduce rows in the final Nested Loop.

## Original SQL

```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sr_reason_sk as ctr_reason_sk
,sum(SR_RETURN_AMT_INC_TAX) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
and sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity between 115 and 174
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk)
 select  c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
,customer_demographics
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
)
and ctr1.ctr_reason_sk BETWEEN 17 AND 20
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state IN ('IA', 'KY', 'NE')
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
and c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
and cd_marital_status IN ('S', 'S')
and cd_education_status IN ('4 yr Degree', '4 yr Degree')
and cd_gender = 'M'
and c_birth_month = 4
and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1987 AND 1993
order by c_customer_id
limit 100;
```

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
In t4's SQL, correct ON c.c_current_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk and ensure all CTE column aliases match main query references.
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
