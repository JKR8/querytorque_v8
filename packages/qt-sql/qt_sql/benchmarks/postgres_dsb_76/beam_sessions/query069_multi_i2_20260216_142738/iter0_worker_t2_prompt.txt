## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — date_materialization
**Hypothesis**: Identical date_dim scans repeated 3×. Materializing date keys first reduces redundant I/O and computation.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer c, customer_address ca, customer_demographics
    WHERE [5bc66d236b3490a1]: c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk AND ca_state IN ('GA', 'KY', 'SD') AND cd_demo_sk = c.c_cu...
    GROUP BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cd_purchase_estimate, cd_credit_rating
    ORDER BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cd_purchase_estimate, cd_credit_rating

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: date_filter (via Q0)
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year=1999 AND d_moy BETWEEN 3 AND 5
  CTE: store_customers (via Q1)
    SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_filter ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 52 AND 141
  CTE: web_customers (via Q2)
    SELECT DISTINCT ws_bill_customer_sk
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN date_filter ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE ws_list_price BETWEEN 52 AND 141
  CTE: catalog_customers (via Q3)
    SELECT DISTINCT cs_ship_customer_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN date_filter ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 52 AND 141
  ... [MAIN QUERY same as t1]
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
