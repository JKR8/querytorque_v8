## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A+B — early_filter_then_decorrelate
**Hypothesis**: Pushing 'ca_state='IA'' into the CTE reduces CTE output from 288K to ~5.7K rows, slashing scan times (509ms in syn_w2) and aggregation costs (258ms). Decorrelation already avoids per-row subquery execution.

## Original SQL

```sql
with customer_total_return as
 (select cr_returning_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
        ,ca_state as ctr_state, 
 	sum(cr_return_amt_inc_tax) as ctr_total_return
 from catalog_returns
     ,date_dim
     ,customer_address
 where cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk 
   and d_year =2000
   and cr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 group by cr_returning_customer_sk
         ,ca_state )
  select  c_customer_id,c_salutation,c_first_name,c_last_name,ca_street_number,ca_street_name
                   ,ca_street_type,ca_suite_number,ca_city,ca_county,ca_state,ca_zip,ca_country,ca_gmt_offset
                  ,ca_location_type,ctr_total_return
 from customer_total_return ctr1
     ,customer_address
     ,customer
 where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
 			  from customer_total_return ctr2 
                  	  where ctr1.ctr_state = ctr2.ctr_state)
       and ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
       and ca_state = 'IA'
       and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0:CTE_Q_S0_customer_total_return:WHERE:c0335294749216b8
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
