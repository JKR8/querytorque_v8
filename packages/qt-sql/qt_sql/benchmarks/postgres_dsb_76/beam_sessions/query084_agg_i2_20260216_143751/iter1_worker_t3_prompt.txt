## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter_fixed
**Hypothesis**: Repair literal mismatch in prior Family A attempts by preserving '40374 + 50000'. Isolates filters in CTEs to reduce rows before joining customer.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  'Mount Vernon'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  40374
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  40374 + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income_band, store_returns
    WHERE [902641332ecd3fb0]: ca_city = 'Mount Vernon' AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ib_lower_bound >= 40374 AND ib...
    ORDER BY: c_customer_id

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
WITH addr AS (SELECT ca_address_sk FROM customer_address WHERE ca_city = 'Mount Vernon'), income AS (SELECT ib_income_band_sk FROM income_band WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 40374 AND ib_upper_bound <= 40374 + 50000) SELECT c_customer_id AS customer_id, coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') AS customername FROM customer, addr, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income, store_returns WHERE c_current_addr_sk = addr.ca_address_sk AND ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk AND sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk ORDER BY c_customer_id LIMIT 100;
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
