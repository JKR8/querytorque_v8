## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — dimension_filter_ctes
**Hypothesis**: Filters on dimension tables (store, item) are applied late. Materializing them as CTEs allows early reduction of store_sales rows via foreign key joins.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_item_id,
        s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state,
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
        avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
        avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(ss_sales_price) agg4
from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
      ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and
      ss_store_sk = s_store_sk and
      ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
      cd_gender = 'M' and
      cd_marital_status = 'W' and
      cd_education_status = 'Secondary' and
      d_year = 1999 and
      s_state = 'OH' and
     i_category  = 'Music'
 group by rollup (i_item_id, s_state)
 order by i_item_id
         ,s_state
 limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item
    WHERE [67958869346fab14]: ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk AND ss_cdemo_...
    ORDER BY: i_item_id, s_state

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_store  (via Q1)
    FROM: store
    WHERE: s_state = 'OH'
  CTE: filtered_item  (via Q2)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category = 'Music'
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: store_sales
    JOIN: filtered_store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    JOIN: filtered_item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    JOIN: date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN: customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    WHERE: d_year = 1999
      AND cd_gender = 'M'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'W'
      AND cd_education_status = 'Secondary'
    GROUP BY: ROLLUP (i_item_id, s_state)
    ORDER BY: i_item_id, s_state
    LIMIT: 100
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
