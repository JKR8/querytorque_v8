### Analysis of Optimization Families

**Family A: Early Filtering (HIGH)**  
The query applies multiple dimension table filters (date_dim, customer_demographics, store, item) that could be pushed into CTEs before joining with the large store_sales table. This reduces the fact table scan early.

**Family B: Decorrelation (LOW)**  
No correlated subqueries exist. The execution plan shows no DELIM_SCAN or per-row re-execution patterns.

**Family C: Aggregation Pushdown (HIGH)**  
GROUP BY happens after all joins, but keys (i_item_id, s_state) derive from dimension tables. Pre-aggregating store_sales by foreign keys (ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk) after filtering reduces intermediate rows before expensive joins.

**Family D: Set Operations (LOW)**  
No INTERSECT/UNION operations exist. The query uses only joins and aggregation.

**Family E: Materialization/Prefetch (MEDIUM)**  
Repeated dimension scans don’t occur, but materializing filtered dimensions (date_dim, customer_demographics) as CTEs allows reuse in the fact table join.

**Family F: Join Transform (HIGH)**  
Implicit comma joins prevent optimal join order control. Converting to explicit JOINs enables better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

**Chosen Families**: A, C, E, F  
**Confidence**: High (All families address clear structural bottlenecks)

### Notes
- **Primary Target (t1)**: Aggregation pushdown (Family C) is routed to W4 ("Wildcard") for maximal optimization effort. It combines early filtering (Family A) and materialization (Family E) by pre-aggregating store_sales after joining with filtered dimensions.
- **Secondary Targets**: Explicit join restructuring (t2) and dimension CTEs (t3) provide complementary optimizations. All targets work synergistically.
- **Omitted Families**: B and D are irrelevant (no subqueries/set operations). Family E is partially covered in t1/t3.
