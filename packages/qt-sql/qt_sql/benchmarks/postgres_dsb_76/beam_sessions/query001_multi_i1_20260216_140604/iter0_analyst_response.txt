## Analysis
**Family A (Early Filtering): HIGH**  
Store state (`s_state IN (...)`) and reason_sk (`BETWEEN 43 AND 46`) filters are applied late in the main query. Pushing these into the CTE reduces rows before expensive aggregation and joins. The store table join can be moved into CTE to eliminate a separate scan.

**Family B (Decorrelation): HIGH**  
Correlated subquery computes average per store for every outer row, causing repeated full CTE scans. Precomputing store-level aggregates in a separate CTE enables efficient join-based comparison.

**Family C (Aggregation Pushdown): LOW**  
Grouping already occurs at finest granularity (customer/store/reason) needed for later joins. No coarser pre-aggregation opportunities exist.

**Family D (Set Operations): LOW**  
No INTERSECT/UNION operations present in query structure.

**Family E (Materialization): MEDIUM**  
CTE is already materialized by default in PostgreSQL. While store state filter pushdown reduces CTE size, materialization itself isn't the primary bottleneck.

**Family F (Join Transform): MEDIUM**  
Comma joins could be converted to explicit INNER JOINs, but execution plan doesn't show join order as primary bottleneck. Decorrelation and early filtering provide higher ROI.

**Chosen families**: A, B  
**Confidence**: High  
Primary bottleneck is correlated subquery (Family B). Secondary opportunity exists in pushing store/reason filters into CTE (Family A). These are complementary optimizations that reduce both aggregation cost and subquery overhead.
