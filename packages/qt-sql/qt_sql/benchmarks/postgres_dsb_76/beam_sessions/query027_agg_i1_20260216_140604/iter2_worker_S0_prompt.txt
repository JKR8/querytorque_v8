## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A+C — agg_pushdown_after_early_filter+fixed_agg_pushdown
**Hypothesis**: After CTE filtering (A), push aggregation to store_sales using ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk to reduce rows processed by the Nested Loop (time=7.458) and final Aggregate (time=7.898). | Fix t1's error by including s_state in filtered_store CTE. Pre-aggregate store_sales after joining CTEs to reduce input to the final Aggregate (time=7.898).

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_item_id,
        s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state,
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
        avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
        avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(ss_sales_price) agg4
from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, store, item
where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
      ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and
      ss_store_sk = s_store_sk and
      ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
      cd_gender = 'F' and
      cd_marital_status = 'M' and
      cd_education_status = 'Primary' and
      d_year = 2002 and
      s_state = 'IA' and
     i_category  = 'Sports'
 group by rollup (i_item_id, s_state)
 order by i_item_id
         ,s_state
 limit 100;
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
