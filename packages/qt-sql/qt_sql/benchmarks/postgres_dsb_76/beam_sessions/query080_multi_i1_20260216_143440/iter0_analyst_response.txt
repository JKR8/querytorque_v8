### Analysis of Optimization Families:

**Family A (Early Filtering):** HIGH  
Repeated dimension table scans (date_dim, promotion, item) with identical filters across all three CTEs. Pushing filters into precomputed CTEs would reduce redundant processing.

**Family B (Decorrelation):** LOW  
No correlated subqueries detected. All joins are explicit left/outer joins without per-row re-execution patterns.

**Family C (Aggregation Pushdown):** LOW  
GROUP BY keys (store_id, catalog_page_id, etc.) aren't subsets of join keys. Profit calculation requires post-join aggregation due to coalesce() logic.

**Family D (Set Operation Optimization):** LOW  
UNION ALL operations are already optimal (no duplicate elimination). No INTERSECT/EXCEPT patterns.

**Family E (Materialization/Prefetch):** HIGH  
Identical dimension filters (date range, promotion channels, item criteria) reapplied across all three CTEs. Precomputing these filtered dimensions is critical.

**Family F (Join Transform):** MEDIUM  
Comma-separated joins limit predicate pushdown control. Converting to explicit joins could improve join order flexibility.

**Chosen families:** [E, A, F]  
**Confidence:** High (E), High (A), Medium (F)
