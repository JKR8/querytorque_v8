Based on the analysis of the query structure, execution plan, and optimization families, the primary bottleneck is the correlated subquery in the main WHERE clause. This forces per-row re-execution of the CTE scan for state averages, causing significant overhead. Below are the optimization targets:

## Analysis
### Family Relevance Assessment
- **A (Early Filtering)**: HIGH  
  State/reason filters can be pushed earlier into CTEs to reduce intermediate data volume.
- **B (Decorrelation)**: HIGH  
  Correlated subquery forces per-row CTE rescans - primary bottleneck.
- **C (Aggregation Pushdown)**: MEDIUM  
  Grouping could be pushed before joins, but CTE structure limits opportunities.
- **D (Set Operations)**: LOW  
  No set operations (UNION/INTERSECT) in query.
- **E (Materialization)**: MEDIUM  
  Base CTE reuse avoids redundant scans of web_returns/date_dim/item.
- **F (Join Transform)**: LOW  
  Explicit joins already optimized; no comma-join issues.

**Chosen families**: B, A, E  
**Confidence**: High (plan shows correlated CTE scan consuming >99% of runtime)
