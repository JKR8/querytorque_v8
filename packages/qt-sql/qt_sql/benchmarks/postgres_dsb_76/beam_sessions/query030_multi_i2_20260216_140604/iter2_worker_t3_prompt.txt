## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A+B — push_reason_filter_then_decorrelate
**Hypothesis**: First push wr_reason_sk filter into CTE to reduce aggregation workload (Seq Scan on web_returns currently 566.786ms), then apply decorrelation. Early filter reduces input to expensive aggregation.

## Original SQL

 ,ca_state as ctr_state
,wr_reason_sk as ctr_reason_sk
,sum(wr_return_amt) as ctr_total_return

     ,customer_address
     ,item

   and d_year =2002
   and wr_returning_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and wr_item_sk = i_item_sk
   and i_manager_id BETWEEN 68 and 77
   and wr_return_amt / wr_return_quantity between 242 and 271

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
