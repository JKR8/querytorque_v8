## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — prefiltered_returns_cte
**Hypothesis**: Isolate NOT EXISTS logic into a CTE prefiltering web_returns for wr_reason_sk IN (7,25,26,52,69). Shrinks the anti-join source from 50k rows (current Hash) to a minimal set.

## Original SQL

```sql
select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '2002-9-01' and
           cast('2002-9-01' as date) + interval '60 day'
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state in ('CA','MI','OH'
            ,'SD' ,'TX' ,'VA')
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_gmt_offset >= -5
and ws1.ws_list_price between 237 and 266
and exists (select *
            from web_sales ws2
            where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
              and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
and not exists(select *
               from web_returns wr1
               where ws1.ws_order_number = wr1.wr_order_number
               and wr1.wr_reason_sk in (7, 25, 26, 52, 69)
               )
order by count(distinct ws_order_number)
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: web_sales ws1, date_dim, customer_address, web_site
    WHERE [74c14ff27ffaa6c7]: d_date BETWEEN '2002-9-01' AND CAST('2002-9-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY' AND ws1.ws_ship_date...
    ORDER BY: COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
