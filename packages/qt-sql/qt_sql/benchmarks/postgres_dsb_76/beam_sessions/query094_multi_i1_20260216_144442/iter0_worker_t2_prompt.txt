## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: F+E — explicit_join_restructure+prefiltered_sales_cte
**Hypothesis**: Comma joins obscure join dependencies. Restructure with explicit joins and optimal order: filtered dimensions → web_sales → anti-join. | Repeated web_sales scans (main + EXISTS) waste effort. Precompute filtered sales in CTE for reuse.

## Original SQL

   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"

   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '2002-9-01' and
           cast('2002-9-01' as date) + interval '60 day'
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state in ('CA','MI','OH'
            ,'SD' ,'TX' ,'VA')
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_gmt_offset >= -5
and ws1.ws_list_price between 237 and 266
and exists (select *
            from web_sales ws2
            where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
              and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
