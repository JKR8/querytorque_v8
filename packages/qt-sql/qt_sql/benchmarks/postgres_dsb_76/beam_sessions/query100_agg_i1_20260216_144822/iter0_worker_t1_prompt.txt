## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — multi_dimension_prefetch
**Hypothesis**: Repeated scans of store_sales for s1 and s2 with overlapping date/list_price filters. Materialize filtered store_sales once with date_dim and list_price constraints.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk, count(*) as cnt
FROM item AS item1,
item AS item2,
store_sales AS s1,
store_sales AS s2,
date_dim,
customer,
customer_address,
customer_demographics
WHERE
item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk
AND s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number
AND s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk and s2.ss_item_sk = item2.i_item_sk
AND s1.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
AND d_year between 1998 and 1998 + 1
and d_date_sk = s1.ss_sold_date_sk
and item1.i_category in ('Electronics', 'Jewelry')
and item2.i_manager_id between 81 and 100
and cd_marital_status = 'S'
and cd_education_status = 'College'
and s1.ss_list_price between 108 and 122
and s2.ss_list_price between 108 and 122
GROUP BY item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk
ORDER BY cnt
;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: item item1, item item2, store_sales s1, store_sales s2, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics
    WHERE [2629428ff83c1264]: item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk AND s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number AND s1.ss_item_sk...
    GROUP BY: item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk
    ORDER BY: cnt

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: prefetched_sales (via Q1)
    FROM: store_sales
    JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    WHERE: d_year BETWEEN 1998 AND 1999
      AND ss_list_price BETWEEN 108 AND 122
  MAIN QUERY
    FROM: prefetched_sales s1
    JOIN prefetched_sales s2 ON s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number
    JOIN item item1 ON s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk
    JOIN item item2 ON s2.ss_item_sk = item2.i_item_sk
    JOIN customer ON s1.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN customer_demographics ON c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    WHERE: item1.i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Jewelry')
      AND item2.i_manager_id BETWEEN 81 AND 100
      AND item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk
      AND cd_marital_status = 'S'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'
    GROUP BY: item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk
    ORDER BY: cnt
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
