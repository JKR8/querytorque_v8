## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — item_filter_pushdown
**Hypothesis**: Item filters apply late after large sales join. Push item1/i_category and item2/i_manager_id filters into CTEs to reduce early join cardinality.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk, count(*) as cnt
FROM item AS item1,
item AS item2,
store_sales AS s1,
store_sales AS s2,
date_dim,
customer,
customer_address,
customer_demographics
WHERE
item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk
AND s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number
AND s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk and s2.ss_item_sk = item2.i_item_sk
AND s1.ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
AND d_year between 1999 and 1999 + 1
and d_date_sk = s1.ss_sold_date_sk
and item1.i_category in ('Electronics', 'Men')
and item2.i_manager_id between 44 and 63
and cd_marital_status = 'D'
and cd_education_status = 'College'
and s1.ss_list_price between 115 and 129
and s2.ss_list_price between 115 and 129
GROUP BY item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk
ORDER BY cnt
;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: item item1, item item2, store_sales s1, store_sales s2, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics
    WHERE [2dafc52d90775c79]: item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk AND s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number AND s1.ss_item_sk...
    GROUP BY: item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk
    ORDER BY: cnt

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_item1  (via Q1)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men')
  CTE: filtered_item2  (via Q2)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_manager_id BETWEEN 44 AND 63
  CTE: prefetched_sales  (via Q3)  
    ...  
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: prefetched_sales s1
      INNER JOIN filtered_item1 item1 ON s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN prefetched_sales s2 ON s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number
      INNER JOIN filtered_item2 item2 ON s2.ss_item_sk = item2.i_item_sk
    WHERE: item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk
    GROUP BY: ...
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
