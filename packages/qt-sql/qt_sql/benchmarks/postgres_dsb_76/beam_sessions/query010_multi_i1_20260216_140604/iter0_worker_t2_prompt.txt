## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — dimension_prefetch
**Hypothesis**: date_dim and item are scanned 3x with identical filters. Materializing these first avoids redundant I/O.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer c, customer_address ca, customer_demographics
    WHERE [367f52d66e539ba4]: c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk AND ca_county IN ('Grays Harbor County', 'Kootenai County'...

    ORDER BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cd_purchase_estimate, cd_credit_rating, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: prefetch_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy BETWEEN 8 AND 11
  )
  CTE: prefetch_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Children','Electronics','Music')
      AND i_manager_id BETWEEN 66 AND 75
  )
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    ... [original EXISTS subqueries modified to use prefetch_dates/prefetch_items] ...
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
