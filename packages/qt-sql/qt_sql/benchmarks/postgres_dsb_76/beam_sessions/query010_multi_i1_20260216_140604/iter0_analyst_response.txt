### Analysis of Optimization Families

**Family A: Early Filtering (HIGH)**  
The query applies dimension filters (county, birth_month, demographics) late after joins. Pushing these into CTEs early would reduce the customer/customer_address join cardinality significantly.

**Family B: Decorrelation (HIGH)**  
The correlated EXISTS subqueries force re-execution per row. The main bottleneck is the repeated date_dim/item scans across 3 subqueries. Decorrelating via shared CTEs is critical.

**Family C: Aggregation Pushdown (LOW)**  
No aggregation opportunities in subqueries. The main GROUP BY happens late but is necessary for final dimensions.

**Family D: Set Operation Optimization (MEDIUM)**  
The OR-connected EXISTS could benefit from UNION-based transformation, but decorrelation is more impactful.

**Family E: Materialization (HIGH)**  
Multiple subqueries scan identical date_dim/item ranges. Materializing these once would eliminate redundant scans.

**Family F: Join Transform (MEDIUM)**  
Implicit comma joins could be converted to explicit joins, but this is secondary to decorrelation.

**Chosen families**: B, E, A  
**Confidence**: High (plan shows 3x date_dim scans and nested loops for correlated subqueries)
