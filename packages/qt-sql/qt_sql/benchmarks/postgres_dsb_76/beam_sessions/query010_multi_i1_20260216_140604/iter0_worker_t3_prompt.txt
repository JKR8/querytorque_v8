## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — customer_early_filter
**Hypothesis**: County/birth_month filters apply too late. Pre-filter customer/customer_address before demographics join.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer c, customer_address ca, customer_demographics
    WHERE [367f52d66e539ba4]: c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk AND ca_county IN ('Grays Harbor County', 'Kootenai County'...
    GROUP BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cd_purchase_estimate, cd_credit_rating, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count
    ORDER BY: cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cd_purchase_estimate, cd_credit_rating, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_customers AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk
    FROM customer
    JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    WHERE ca_county IN ('Grays Harbor County','Kootenai County','Pike County','Thomas County','Uinta County')
      AND c_birth_month IN (1,5)
  )
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: filtered_customers c
    JOIN customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
    ... [remaining logic] ...
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
