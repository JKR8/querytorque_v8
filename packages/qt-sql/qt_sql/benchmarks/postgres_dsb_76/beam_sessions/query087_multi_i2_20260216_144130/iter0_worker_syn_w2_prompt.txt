## Role

You are **W2 "Unnester"** — Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Eliminate per-row re-execution: convert correlated subqueries to GROUP BY CTEs, push aggregation before joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: B — decorrelate
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Unnester: Logic simplification — decorrelation, aggregation pushdown. Apply decorrelate patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select count(*)
from ((select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from store_sales, date_dim, customer
       where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
         and ss_list_price between 168 and 197
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974
         and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86
         )
       except
      (select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from catalog_sales, date_dim, customer
       where catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
         and cs_list_price between 168 and 197
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974
         and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86
         )
       except
      (select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date

         and web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
         and ws_list_price between 168 and 197
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974
         and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86
         )
) cool_cust
;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: (subquery) cool_cust

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_date (via Q1)
    SELECT: d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
  CTE: filtered_cust (via Q2)
    SELECT: c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name
    FROM: customer
    WHERE: c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: (
      (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       FROM store_sales
         INNER JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
         INNER JOIN filtered_cust ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
       WHERE ss_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
         AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86)
      EXCEPT
      (SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       FROM catalog_sales
         INNER JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
         INNER JOIN filtered_cust ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
       WHERE cs_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
         AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86)
      EXCEPT
      (SELECT DISTINCT ... /* web_sales mirror */)
    ) cool_cust
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
