## Analysis

**Family Relevance**:  
- **F (HIGH)**: Comma joins force cross-join semantics, blocking predicate pushdown. Restructuring to explicit INNER JOINs with key-driven filters enables better join order selection and reduces nested loop iterations.  
- **A (HIGH)**: Late application of customer_demographics and address filters (current plan applies them after web_sales/web_returns join) misses early row reduction opportunities.  
- **E (MEDIUM)**: Separate scans of customer_demographics (cd1/cd2) with overlapping filters suggest materialization benefits.  
- **C (LOW)**: GROUP BY key (r_reason_desc) is not present in early join keys, making aggregation pushdown infeasible.  
- **B/D (LOW)**: No correlated subqueries or set operations in query structure.  

**Chosen families**: [F, A, E]  
**Confidence**: High (plan shows nested loops with late predicate evaluation; explicit joins and predicate pushdown directly address this bottleneck)
