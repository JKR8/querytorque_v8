## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — cd_ca_predicate_pushdown
**Hypothesis**: Customer demographics and address predicates execute late in JOIN sequence. Push marital/education/state filters directly into their respective dimension table JOINs.

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: web_sales, web_returns, web_page, customer_demographics cd1, customer_demographics cd2, customer_address, date_dim, reason
    WHERE [edf10a498f1ee83a]: ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk AND ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk AND ws_order_number = wr_order_number...
    GROUP BY: r_reason_desc
    ORDER BY: SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc FROM 1 FOR 20), AVG(ws_quantity), AVG(wr_refunded_cash), AVG(wr_fee)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: web_sales
      INNER JOIN date_dim ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
      INNER JOIN web_returns ON ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk AND ws_order_number = wr_order_number
      INNER JOIN customer_demographics cd1 ON cd1.cd_demo_sk = wr_refunded_cdemo_sk 
        AND ( (
          cd1.cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd1.cd_education_status = 'College' AND ws_sales_price BETWEEN 100 AND 150
        ) OR ... )
      INNER JOIN customer_demographics cd2 ON cd2.cd_demo_sk = wr_returning_cdemo_sk 
        AND cd2.cd_marital_status = cd1.cd_marital_status

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
