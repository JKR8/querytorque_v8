## Role

You are **W4 "Wildcard"** — Deep specialist for the #1 identified problem. Focus entirely on the highest-priority optimization target. May combine strategies from multiple families or try novel approaches not covered by other workers.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: F — explicit_join_restructuring
**Hypothesis**: Implicit cross joins force full scan of 250K-row 'customer' table before applying selective filters. Restructuring with explicit INNER JOINs starting from 'customer_address' reduces base row count by 99.98%.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  'Jackson'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  23567
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  23567 + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income_band, store_returns
    WHERE [bfc6729fe553d3e9]: ca_city = 'Jackson' AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk AND ib_lower_bound >= 23567 AND ib_uppe...
    ORDER BY: c_customer_id

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer_address
      INNER JOIN customer ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
      INNER JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
      INNER JOIN household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
      INNER JOIN income_band ON ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
      INNER JOIN store_returns ON sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    WHERE: ca_city = 'Jackson' 
      AND ib_lower_bound >= 23567 
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 73567
    ORDER BY: c_customer_id
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
