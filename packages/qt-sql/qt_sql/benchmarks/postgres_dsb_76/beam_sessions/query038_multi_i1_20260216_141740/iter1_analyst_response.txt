Based on the analysis of the query structure, execution plan, and failed optimizations, the primary bottleneck is the **SetOp (INTERSECT) materialization** (822.46 ms) which processes full intermediate results from all three sales branches. The secondary bottleneck is **repeated dimension table scans** (date_dim scanned 3x, customer scanned 3x) totaling ~10ms per scan.

Here are the optimized targets for the next round:

### Key Rationale:
1. **Primary Target (D+E)**: Combines the most impactful optimizations:
   - **SetOp Elimination (Family D)**: Targets the 822ms SetOp by converting to EXISTS
   - **Dimension Prefetch (Family E)**: Eliminates 3x repeated date_dim/customer scans
   - Complementary as SetOp targets root bottleneck while prefetching handles leaf scans

2. **Secondary Target (D+C)**: Addresses SetOp + expensive Nested Loop:
   - **Aggregation Pushdown (Family C)**: Reduces rows before the 422ms store_sales Nested Loop
   - Grouping sales by (customer_sk, date_sk) before joins minimizes row processing

3. **Rescue Target (E)**: Fixes prior implementation error:
   - Preserves literal `1200 + 11` verbatim to avoid validation failure
   - Isolates dimension scan reduction as fallback if SetOp rewrite fails

### Avoided Families:
- **Family B (Decorrelation)**: No correlated subqueries in plan
- **Family F (Join Transform)**: Comma joins already optimized to nested loops
- **Family A (Early Filtering)**: Superseded by E's dimension prefetching

All targets strictly preserve original literals to avoid validation failures. The combination approach (D+E) has highest confidence given SetOp dominates runtime while dimension scans are low-hanging fruit.
