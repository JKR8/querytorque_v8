## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E — materialize_cte
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Builder: Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Apply materialize_cte patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (47, 226, 612, 676, 818)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1998-01-06' and
        cast('1998-01-06' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
          and d_date between '1998-01-06' and
                             cast('1998-01-06' as date) + interval '90 day'
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 108 and 137
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 23 * 0.01 AND 43 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, item, date_dim
    WHERE [919d34e6f9bd61fc]: (i_manufact_id IN (47, 226, 612, 676, 818) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 AND 100) AND i_item_sk = cs...
    ORDER BY: SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt)

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: item_avg_discount
    SELECT: cs_item_sk, 1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt) as threshold
    FROM: catalog_sales, date_dim
    WHERE: d_date between '1998-01-06' and cast('1998-01-06' as date) + interval '90 day'
           and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
           and cs_list_price between 108 and 137
           and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 23 * 0.01 AND 43 * 0.01
    GROUP BY: cs_item_sk

  MAIN QUERY
    FROM: catalog_sales, item, date_dim, item_avg_discount t
    WHERE: (i_manufact_id in (47, 226, 612, 676, 818) OR i_manager_id BETWEEN 71 and 100)
           and i_item_sk = catalog_sales.cs_item_sk
           and d_date between '1998-01-06' and cast('1998-01-06' as date) + interval '90 day'
           and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
           and catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = t.cs_item_sk
           and cs_ext_discount_amt > t.threshold
    ORDER BY: sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
