## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Reducer: Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Apply early_filter patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
  from date_dim, store_sales, item,customer,customer_address,store
  where  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND i_category  = 'Shoes'
    and d_year=1999
    and d_moy = 2
    and substring(ca_zip,1,5) <> substring(s_zip,1,5)
    and ca_state  = 'KS'
    and c_birth_month = 2
    and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
 group by i_brand
      ,i_brand_id
      ,i_manufact_id
      ,i_manufact
 order by ext_price desc
         ,i_brand
         ,i_brand_id
         ,i_manufact_id
         ,i_manufact
limit 100 ;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: date_dim, store_sales, item, customer, customer_address, store
    WHERE [4aeecf17073b88b8]: d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk AND ss_item_sk = i_item_sk AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk AND c_c...
    GROUP BY: i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    ORDER BY: ext_price, i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: pre_item (via Q1)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category = 'Shoes'
  CTE: pre_customer (via Q2)
    FROM: customer
    WHERE: c_birth_month = 2
  CTE: pre_ca (via Q3)
    FROM: customer_address
    WHERE: ca_state = 'KS'
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: store_sales
      INNER JOIN date_dim ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
      INNER JOIN pre_item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
      INNER JOIN pre_customer ON ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
      INNER JOIN pre_ca ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
      INNER JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE: d_year = 1999
      AND d_moy = 2
      AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
      AND substring(ca_zip,1,5) <> substring(s_zip,1,5)
    GROUP BY: i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    ORDER BY: ext_price desc, i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
