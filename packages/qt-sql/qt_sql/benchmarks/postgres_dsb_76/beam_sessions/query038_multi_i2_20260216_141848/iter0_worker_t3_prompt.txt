## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — predicate_pushback
**Hypothesis**: Filters on sales tables (list_price, wholesale_cost) are applied after joins. Pushing them into CTEs reduces join input sizes early.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  count(*) from (
    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    from store_sales, date_dim, customer
          where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      and store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
      and d_month_seq between 1207 and 1207 + 11
      and c_birth_month in (2, 3, 4, 10)
      and ss_list_price between 241 and 300
      and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
  intersect
    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    from catalog_sales, date_dim, customer
          where catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      and catalog_sales.cs_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
      and d_month_seq between 1207 and 1207 + 11
      and c_birth_month in (2, 3, 4, 10)
      and cs_list_price between 241 and 300
      and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
  intersect
    select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
    from web_sales, date_dim, customer
          where web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
      and web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
      and d_month_seq between 1207 and 1207 + 11
      and c_birth_month in (2, 3, 4, 10)
      and ws_list_price between 241 and 300
      and ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
) hot_cust
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: (subquery) hot_cust

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: store_sales_filtered (via Q1)
    FROM: store_sales
    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 241 AND 300
      AND ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
  CTE: catalog_sales_filtered (via Q2)
    FROM: catalog_sales
    WHERE: cs_list_price BETWEEN 241 AND 300
      AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
  CTE: web_sales_filtered (via Q3)
    FROM: web_sales
    WHERE: ws_list_price BETWEEN 241 AND 300
      AND ws_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: (
      SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
      FROM store_sales_filtered, date_dim, customer
      WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
        AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1207 AND 1218
        AND c_birth_month IN (2,3,4,10)
      INTERSECT
      SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
      FROM catalog_sales_filtered, date_dim, customer
      WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
        AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1207 AND 1218
        AND c_birth_month IN (2,3,4,10)
      INTERSECT
      SELECT DISTINCT c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
      FROM web_sales_filtered, date_dim, customer
      WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        AND ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
        AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1207 AND 1218
        AND c_birth_month IN (2,3,4,10)
    ) hot_cust
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
