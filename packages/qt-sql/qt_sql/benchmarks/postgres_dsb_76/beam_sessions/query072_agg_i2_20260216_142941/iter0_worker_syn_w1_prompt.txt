## Role

You are **W1 "Reducer"** — Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Reduce row counts early: push predicates into CTEs, convert set operations to EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, apply early filtering before expensive joins.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: A — early_filter
**Hypothesis**: Synthetic target for Reducer: Cardinality reduction — WHERE filters, set operations, early pruning. Apply early_filter patterns to the query.

## Original SQL

```sql
select  i_item_desc
      ,w_warehouse_name
      ,d1.d_week_seq
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) no_promo
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) promo
      ,count(*) total_cnt
from catalog_sales
join inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)
join warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)
join item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
join customer_demographics on (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)
join household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)
join date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)
left outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)
left outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
where d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day'
  and hd_buy_potential = '>10000'
  and d1.d_year = 1999
  and cd_marital_status = 'S'
  and cd_dep_count between 9 and 11
  and i_category IN ('Men', 'Shoes', 'Sports')
  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 96
group by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq
order by total_cnt desc, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
limit 100;
```

## Current IR Node Map

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: catalog_sales, inventory, warehouse, item, customer_demographics, household_demographics, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3, promotion, catalog_returns
    WHERE [ece830e47c29a467]: d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + ...
    GROUP BY: i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq
    ORDER BY: total_cnt, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

## Target IR (what the optimized query should look like)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  CTE: filtered_item (via Q1)
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_category IN ('Men','Shoes','Sports')
  CTE: filtered_cd (via Q2)
    FROM: customer_demographics
    WHERE: cd_marital_status='S' AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11
  CTE: filtered_hd (via Q3)
    FROM: household_demographics
    WHERE: hd_buy_potential='>10000'
  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)
    FROM: catalog_sales
    JOIN inventory ON (cs_item_sk=inv_item_sk)
    JOIN warehouse ON (inv_warehouse_sk=w_warehouse_sk)
    JOIN filtered_item ON (i_item_sk=cs_item_sk)
    JOIN filtered_cd ON (cs_bill_cdemo_sk=cd_demo_sk)
    JOIN filtered_hd ON (cs_bill_hdemo_sk=hd_demo_sk)
    ... [rest unchanged]
```

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "postgres" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
