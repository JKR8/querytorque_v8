## Role

You are a SQL optimization analyst reviewing benchmark results. Analyze what worked, what failed, and design refined targets for the next round of workers.

Identify the primary bottleneck. Only provide secondary targets if they are distinct and high-confidence. Quality > Quantity.

You will see the original query, execution plan, IR structure, and detailed results from previous rounds.

## IR Structure (for patch targeting)

```
S0 [SELECT]
  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: store_sales, store, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address, date_dim
    WHERE [73f355482e5a7264]: s_store_sk = ss_store_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001 AND ((ss_hdemo_sk = hd...

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)

**Note**: Use `by_node_id` (e.g., "S0") and `by_anchor_hash` (16-char hex) from map above to target patch operations.


## Optimization Families

Review the 6 families below. Each has a proven gold example.

Choose up to **4 most relevant families** for this query based on:
- Query structure (CTEs, subqueries, joins, aggregations, set operations)
- Execution plan signals (WHERE placement, repeated scans, correlated subqueries)
- Problem signature (cardinality estimation errors, loops vs sets, filter ordering)



### Family A: Early Filtering (Predicate Pushback)
**Description**: Push small filters into CTEs early, reduce row count before expensive operations
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–4.0x (~35% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Late WHERE filters on dimension tables
  2. Cascading CTEs with filters applied downstream
  3. Expensive joins after filters could be pushed earlier

**Gold Example**: `pg_date_cte_explicit_join` (2.28x)



### Family B: Decorrelation (Sets Over Loops)
**Description**: Convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, eliminate per-row re-execution
**Speedup Range**: 2.4–2.9x (~15% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Correlated subqueries in WHERE clause
  2. Scalar aggregates computed per outer row
  3. DELIM_SCAN in execution plan (indicates correlation)

**Gold Example**: `pg_shared_scan_decorrelate` (8043.91x (timeout rescue))



### Family C: Aggregation Pushdown (Minimize Rows Touched)
**Description**: Aggregate before expensive joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys, reduce intermediate sizes
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–15.3x (~5% of all wins (high variance))
**Use When**:
  1. GROUP BY happens after large joins
  2. GROUP BY keys are subset of join keys
  3. Intermediate result size >> final result size

**Gold Example**: `pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter` (12.07x (V2 DSB SF10, was 2.68x in V1))



### Family D: Set Operation Optimization (Sets Over Loops)
**Description**: Replace INTERSECT/UNION-based patterns with EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, avoid full materialization
**Speedup Range**: 1.7–2.7x (~8% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. INTERSECT patterns between large sets
  2. UNION ALL with duplicate elimination
  3. Set operations materializing full intermediate results

**Gold Example**: `pg_intersect_to_exists` (1.78x)



### Family E: Materialization / Prefetch (Don't Repeat Work)
**Description**: Extract repeated scans or pre-compute intermediate results for reuse across multiple consumers
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–6.2x (~18% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Repeated scans of same table with different filters
  2. Dimension filters applied independently multiple times
  3. CTE referenced multiple times with implicit re-evaluation

**Gold Example**: `multi_dimension_prefetch` (2.71x)



### Family F: Join Transform (Right Shape First)
**Description**: Restructure join topology: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, optimize join order, eliminate self-joins via single-pass aggregation
**Speedup Range**: 1.8–8.6x (~19% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Comma-separated joins (implicit cross joins) in FROM clause
  2. Self-joins scanning same table multiple times
  3. Dimension-fact join order suboptimal for predicate pushdown

**Gold Example**: `pg_explicit_join_materialized` (8.56x)

## Your Task — Snipe Round 2


Results from latest iteration: **2 FAIL**.

Follow this protocol exactly.

### Step 1 — Compare EXPLAIN Plans

For each patch above, compare its EXPLAIN plan to the Original EXPLAIN.

For each **WIN**, answer:
- QUOTE the operator line(s) from the original that got cheaper or were eliminated. Give the exact operator name, time, and row count from the plan text above.
- What structural SQL change caused that operator improvement?
- What is the **most expensive remaining operator** in this winner's plan? QUOTE its line (name, time, rows).

For each **FAIL/NEUTRAL/REGRESSION**:
- QUOTE the operator(s) that got MORE expensive vs the original.
- Why did the structural change backfire?

Then classify winners as REDUNDANT (same core structural change, same operators improved) or COMPLEMENTARY (different operators improved, different structural changes).

### Step 2 — Design Targets by Combining Strategies

Start from the **best winner's SQL** as your baseline.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT invent new hypotheses about row counts or selectivity. Every claim about rows, times, or costs MUST be a direct quote from an EXPLAIN plan above. If a number is not in the plans, you do not know it.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT spend targets on optimizer-equivalent rewrites (UNION↔UNION ALL, JOIN↔WHERE IN, CTE↔subquery). These produce identical plans. Focus on changes that **eliminate operators** or **reduce input rows to expensive operators** as shown in the plans.

Design up to 4 targets, prioritized:

1. **Combination** (primary if complementary winners exist): Take the best winner's SQL. Layer on the structural change from a complementary winner that addresses a DIFFERENT expensive operator. Cite both operators by name from the EXPLAIN plans.
2. **Refinement**: Take the best winner's SQL. Target its most expensive remaining operator (quoted in Step 1). Design a structural change that reduces input rows to that operator. CITE the operator and its current row count from the plan.
3. **Rescue** (if a failed patch had a sound structural idea): Fix the implementation while preserving the best winner's gains.
4. **Novel**: A new structural approach that targets the most expensive remaining operator. Cite the operator from the plan.

**Combined families**: You MAY combine families in a single target (e.g. "A+B", "B+E", "A+F"). The worker will receive gold examples from ALL referenced families.

Output up to 4 targets. Same JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "family": "A+B",
    "transform": "early_filter_then_decorrelate",
    "target_id": "t1",
    "relevance_score": 0.95,
    "hypothesis": "...",
    "target_ir": "...",
    "recommended_examples": ["date_cte_isolate", "shared_scan_decorrelate"]
  }
]
```

Output up to 4 targets. Fewer strong targets beat padding with weak ones.
