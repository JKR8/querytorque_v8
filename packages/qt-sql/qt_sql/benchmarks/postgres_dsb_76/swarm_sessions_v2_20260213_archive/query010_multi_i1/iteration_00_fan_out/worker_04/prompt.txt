You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes male customers with specific demographic characteristics who made purchases in Q3 1999 across three sales channels, counting purchases that met discount criteria. All joins are INNER (must match) and the OR between web_sales and catalog_sales creates a union of customers from either channel. Aggregation uses only COUNT(*) which is duplicate-safe. The EXISTS subqueries must preserve semi-join semantics (no row duplication).

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Changing EXISTS to UNION ALL + EXISTS may change performance characteristics
- Multiple EXISTS checks on same CTE may cause repeated scans
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combining dimension prefetch with channel consolidation via UNION ALL)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS to IN conversion (observed 0.50x regression on Q069):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN/NOT IN changes NULL semantics and can block hash semi-joins
   RULE: Preserve EXISTS structure for all three sales channel subqueries
2. OR to UNION ALL splitting (observed 0.21x regression on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches when BITMAP_OR_SCAN is more efficient
   RULE: Keep OR between web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS subqueries intact
3. CTE blocking parallelism (observed in benchmark):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs execute single-threaded, blocking parallel table scans
   RULE: Avoid materializing large fact table CTEs; use inline subqueries for parallelizable scans

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs 14 columns including 6 COUNT aggregates
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (customer keys, demographic attributes)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literal values for counties, birth months, marital status, education, gender, year, month range, categories, manager IDs, price ratios
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (GROUP BY + ORDER BY on 8 columns)
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (line 17)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim and item filters scanned 3 times independently
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Price ratio filters applied after fact table joins filter 90% of rows

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- or_to_union: Convert OR between web_sales and catalog_sales to UNION ALL, but preserve store_sales as mandatory. Ignore the warning about BITMAP_OR_SCAN - we're not splitting OR on indexed columns but consolidating separate fact tables.
- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple fact table scans into single UNION ALL structure. Ignore the aggregation aspect - we're consolidating scans not aggregates.

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `cd_gender`
  2. `cd_marital_status`
  3. `cd_education_status`
  4. `cnt1`
  5. `cd_purchase_estimate`
  6. `cnt2`
  7. `cd_credit_rating`
  8. `cnt3`
  9. `cd_dep_count`
  10. `cnt4`
  11. `cd_dep_employed_count`
  12. `cnt5`
  13. `cd_dep_college_count`
  14. `cnt6`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~121K
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (ca_county IN ('Grays Harbor County', 'Kootenai County', 'Pike County', 'Thomas County', 'Uinta County'))
    ├── FILTER (c.c_birth_month IN (1, 5))
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_education_status ASC, cd_purchase_estimate ASC, cd_credit_rating ASC, cd_dep_count ASC, cd_dep_employed_count ASC, cd_dep_college_count ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
