You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query computes for each store in July 1999 the distribution of return delays (in days) for items sold and returned within 120 days. All joins are INNER joins requiring matches across store_sales, store_returns, store, and two date_dim instances. Aggregation uses conditional sums of 1/0 values (grouping-insensitive). The d1.d_date filter depends on d2.d_date (correlated range: d1.d_date between d2.d_date - 120 days and d2.d_date) - any rewrite must preserve this temporal relationship.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- d1_d2_range CTE may expand to ~1,920 rows (16 * 120) which could be larger than original d1 index scan count.
  - Explicit JOIN syntax may prevent some optimizer reordering.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Never set enable_nestloop=off (observed 184x regression):
   CAUSE: Disabling nested loops forces hash/merge joins that spill to disk for large tables.
   RULE: Avoid SET enable_nestloop=off; nested loops are efficient for indexed lookups on d1.
2. CTEs blocking parallelism (observed 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel table scans.
   RULE: Use non-materialized CTEs (WITHOUT MATERIALIZED) or inline subqueries for large fact joins.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs 10 store columns and 5 aggregated bucket counts.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_sold_date_sk, sr_returned_date_sk, and all store columns used in GROUP BY.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Literal values 1999, 7, 30, 60, 90, 120 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (store attributes).
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (lines 21-25).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: d1.d_date BETWEEN condition correlates with d2.d_date (lines 35-36).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of d2 into CTE and convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax. Ignore multi-dimension prefetch (only d2 is highly selective).
  pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date_dim CTE isolation for d2 and explicit JOINs. Ignore the fact that d1 also needs filtering via correlation.
  early_filter_decorrelate: Apply decorrelation of d1-d2 range condition by pre-joining in CTE. Ignore subquery decorrelation (no subqueries present).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~112K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), store (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+4 more)
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_year = 1999)
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_moy = 7)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC, s_company_id ASC, s_street_number ASC, s_street_name ASC, s_street_type ASC, s_suite_number ASC, s_city ASC, s_county ASC, s_state ASC, s_zip ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, s_company_id, s_street_number, s_street_name, s_street_type, s_suite_number, s_city, s_county, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
