You are a senior SQL optimization architect for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). You have FULL FREEDOM to design your own approach — you are NOT constrained to any specific logical tree topology or CTE structure. Your job: diagnose WHY previous workers failed to reach 2.0x, identify unexplored optimization angles, and produce an optimized SQL rewrite that reaches the target.

Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — guards prevent silent breakage. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from output.

## Target: >=2.0x speedup

Your target is >=2.0x speedup on this query. This is the bar. Anything below 2.0x is a miss.

## Previous Optimization Attempts
Target: **>=2.0x** | 4 workers tried | none reached target

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query analyzes refund patterns by reason description for web sales in 2002, filtering on customer demographics (three specific marital/education combinations with price ranges) and customer address (three US state groups with net profit ranges). All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches across all 8 tables. Aggregates (AVG) are duplicate-sensitive—any rewrite changing row duplication per reason group will break results. The complex OR conditions create predicate dependencies: each branch's filters must remain logically ANDed within that branch, not cross-applied.

## Bottleneck Diagnosis

The execution is join-bound, dominated by nested loop joins between date_dim→web_sales (30K rows) and subsequent dimension lookups. Cardinality flows from 122 date rows to 30K web_sales rows (after price/profit filtering) to only 21 matching web_returns rows, then tiny dimension lookups. The optimizer already handles index scans and predicate pushdown (d_year filter) well. Logical-tree cost percentages are misleading—the 100% cost at root hides that nested loops consume >50% of actual runtime despite small row counts due to repeated index probes.

## Engine Profile

*This is field intelligence gathered from 53 DSB queries at SF5-SF10. PostgreSQL is a fundamentally different optimizer than DuckDB — it has bitmap index scans, JIT compilation, and aggressive CTE materialization. Techniques that work on DuckDB often regress here. Use this to guide your analysis but apply your own judgment — every query is different. Add to this knowledge if you observe something new.*

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)
- **BITMAP_OR_SCAN**: Multi-branch OR conditions on indexed columns are handled via BitmapOr — a single fact table scan with bitmap combination. Extremely efficient.
- **SEMI_JOIN_EXISTS**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination. Stops scanning after the first match per outer row.
- **INNER_JOIN_REORDERING**: PostgreSQL freely reorders INNER JOINs based on estimated selectivity. The cost model works well for explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
- **INDEX_ONLY_SCAN**: When an index covers all requested columns, PostgreSQL reads only the index without touching the heap.
- **PARALLEL_QUERY_EXECUTION**: PostgreSQL parallelizes large scans and aggregations across worker processes with partial aggregation finalization.
- **JIT_COMPILATION**: PostgreSQL JIT-compiles complex expressions and tuple deforming for long-running queries.

### Optimizer Gaps (opportunities)
- **COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS**: Implicit comma-separated FROM tables (FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE t1.id = t2.id) are treated as cross products initially. The cost model is significantly weaker on comma-joins than on explicit JOIN...ON syntax.
  Opportunity: Convert comma-joins to explicit JOIN...ON syntax. This alone can unlock 2-3x improvements. Best when combined with date_cte_isolate.
    + Q080: 3.32x — comma-joins to explicit JOINs + date CTE on multi-channel UNION query
    + Q099: 2.28x — same pattern on star schema
    + Q054: 1.14x — JOIN conversion alone
- **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS**: Cannot automatically decorrelate complex correlated subqueries. Correlated scalar subqueries with aggregates are executed as nested-loop with repeated evaluation.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to explicit CTE with GROUP BY + JOIN.
    + Q092: 4428x — timeout recovery. Unbounded correlated subquery converted to explicit JOIN.
    + Q032: 391x — same pattern, timeout to sub-second.
- **NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS**: Cannot pre-filter fact tables before non-equi join operations (date arithmetic, range comparisons, quantity < quantity). Non-equi joins fall back to nested-loop, which is O(N*M).
  Opportunity: Reduce fact table input size via filtered CTE before the non-equi join.
    + Q072: 2.68x — pre-filtered catalog_sales by wholesale_cost range before non-equi quantity comparison with inventory. Reduced nested-loop input by ~70%.
- **CTE_MATERIALIZATION_FENCE**: PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default (multi-referenced) or by choice (AS MATERIALIZED). This creates a hard optimization fence — no predicate pushdown from outer query into CTE. This makes CTE-based strategies a double-edged sword on PG.
  Opportunity: Use materialization STRATEGICALLY: materialize when the CTE is expensive and reused multiple times. Avoid CTEs that fence off predicate pushdown for single-use cases.
    + Q065: 1.95x — strategic materialization prevented redundant fact table scan multiplication
- **CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS**: Same gap as DuckDB but WORSE on PostgreSQL because CTE materialization fence makes it more impactful. Predicates in the outer WHERE cannot propagate into materialized CTEs.
  Opportunity: Same as DuckDB: pre-filter into CTE definition. But be more cautious — only when the CTE is clearly suboptimal.
    + Q080: 3.32x — date filter + comma-join conversion (the combo is key)
    + Q099: 2.28x — date CTE with explicit JOIN

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 4. pg_self_join_decomposition (3.93x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization (PG): when the same fact+dimension scan appears multiple times in self-join patterns, materialize it once as a CTE and derive all needed aggregates from the same result. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, making this extremely effective.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
	s_store_name,
	i_item_desc,
	sc.revenue,
	i_current_price,
	i_wholesale_cost,
	i_brand
 from store, item,
     (select ss_store_sk, avg(revenue) as ave
	from
	    (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk,
		     sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
		from store_sales, date_dim
		where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
   and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
		group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sa
	group by ss_store_sk) sb,
     (select  ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, sum(ss_sales_price) as revenue
	from store_sales, date_dim
	where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
  and ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 38 * 0.01 AND 48 * 0.01
	group by ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk) sc
 where sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave and
       s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk and
       i_item_sk = sc.ss_item_sk
       and i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 and 36
       and s_state in ('TN','TX','VA')
 order by s_store_name, i_item_desc
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[date_filter]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224
```
[store_sales_revenue]:
```sql
SELECT ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue FROM store_sales JOIN date_filter ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 0.38 AND 0.48 GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
```

```
[filtered_item]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM item WHERE i_manager_id BETWEEN 32 AND 36
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, i_item_desc, sc.revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand FROM store_avg_revenue AS sb JOIN store_sales_revenue AS sc ON sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk JOIN filtered_store AS s ON sc.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk JOIN filtered_item AS i ON sc.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk WHERE sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave ORDER BY s_store_name, i_item_desc LIMIT 100
```

### 5. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales

          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )
order by sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)

```

WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### 6. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

   catalog_sales

d_month_seq between 1193 and 1193 + 23
and cs_ship_date_sk   = d_date_sk

and w_gmt_offset = -5
group by
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
order by substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
        ,sm_type
        ,cc_name
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

## Correctness Invariants (HARD STOPS — non-negotiable)

These 4 constraints are absolute. Even with full creative freedom, you may NEVER violate these:

- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.
- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Aggregation Semantics Check (HARD STOP)

- STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — changing group membership changes the result.
- AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe.
- FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
- Verify aggregation equivalence for ANY proposed restructuring.

## Original SQL

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Your Task — Self-Directed Retry

Work through these 3 steps in a `<reasoning>` block, then output your optimized SQL:

1. **DIAGNOSE**: Why did the best worker achieve 0.9518541794637232x instead of the 2.0x target? What do the EXPLAIN plans reveal about the actual execution bottleneck?
2. **IDENTIFY**: What optimization angles are still unexplored? What did the empirical results reveal that couldn't have been known before seeing the execution plans?
3. **REWRITE**: Produce optimized SQL that exploits the angles you identified. You may build on the best foundation or start fresh.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Verify output schema matches the Column Completeness Contract (same columns, same names, same order).
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Correctness Invariants` (including join/null behavior).
- Verify aggregation equivalence: same rows participate in each group, same aggregate semantics.
- Preserve all literals exactly (numbers, strings, date values).
- Apply `Hazard Flags` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc, 1, 20`
  2. `AVG(ws_quantity)`
  3. `AVG(wr_refunded_cash)`
  4. `AVG(wr_fee)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
