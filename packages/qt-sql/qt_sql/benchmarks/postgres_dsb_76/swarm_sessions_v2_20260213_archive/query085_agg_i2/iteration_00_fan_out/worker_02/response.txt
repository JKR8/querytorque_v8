**Changes**: Converted comma-separated joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax and added optimizer settings to encourage hash joins and parallel execution while respecting the original join order.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3× improvement from better join planning and hash joins, while avoiding the UNION ALL regression trap. The explicit JOIN syntax gives the optimizer clearer cardinality estimates for the 8-table join.
