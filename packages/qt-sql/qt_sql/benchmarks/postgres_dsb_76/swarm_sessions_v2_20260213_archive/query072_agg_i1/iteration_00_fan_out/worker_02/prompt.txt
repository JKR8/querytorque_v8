You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Analyze weekly sales patterns comparing promotional vs non-promotional items, focusing on high-buy-potential households, unmarried customers with 9-11 dependents, and specific product categories. All dimension joins are INNER except promotion and catalog_returns are LEFT OUTER (must preserve nulls for promo counting). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) and conditional SUMs which are grouping-insensitive but depend on LEFT JOIN null preservation. Critical filter dependencies: d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq (date correlation), d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 3 days (temporal gap), and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity (non-equi join).

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
core_filters -> initial_aggregation -> attach_descriptions
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  core_filters:
    FROM: catalog_sales, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3, inventory, customer_demographics, household_demographics

    WHERE: d1.d_year = 1998 AND d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day' AND inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity AND hd_buy_potential = '>10000' AND cd_marital_status = 'U' AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11 AND cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 35 AND 55
    OUTPUT: cs_item_sk, cs_promo_sk, cs_order_number, d1.d_week_seq, inv_warehouse_sk

    AGGREGATE: SUM(CASE WHEN cs_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as no_promo, SUM(CASE WHEN cs_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as promo, COUNT(*) as total_cnt
    OUTPUT: cs_item_sk, inv_warehouse_sk, d1.d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: <163K rows (grouped)
    CONSUMERS: attach_descriptions
  attach_descriptions:
    FROM: initial_aggregation, item, warehouse, promotion p LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns cr ON (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
    JOIN: i_item_sk = initial_aggregation.cs_item_sk AND w_warehouse_sk = initial_aggregation.inv_warehouse_sk AND p.p_promo_sk = initial_aggregation.cs_promo_sk
    WHERE: i_category IN ('Children', 'Jewelry', 'Men')
    OUTPUT: i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt

NODE_CONTRACTS:
core_filters:
    FROM: catalog_sales, date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3, inventory, customer_demographics, household_demographics
    JOIN: cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND inv_item_sk = cs_item_sk AND inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk

    OUTPUT: cs_item_sk, cs_promo_sk, cs_order_number, d1.d_week_seq, inv_warehouse_sk

    AGGREGATE: SUM(CASE WHEN cs_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as no_promo, SUM(CASE WHEN cs_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as promo, COUNT(*) as total_cnt
    OUTPUT: cs_item_sk, inv_warehouse_sk, d1.d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: <163K rows (grouped)
    CONSUMERS: attach_descriptions

    EXPECTED_ROWS: ≤ initial_aggregation rows (item filter may reduce)
    CONSUMERS: final_sort_limit

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure catalog_returns LEFT JOIN semantics preserved after aggregation (joins on cs_item_sk, cs_order_number which are in GROUP BY).
- Item category filter applied late may discard groups; verify i_category filter doesn't change grouping.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in SF-005):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scans of large fact tables.
   RULE: For

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream including cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, inv_quantity_on_hand, d1.d_date, d1.d_week_seq, d2.d_week_seq, d3.d_date, p_promo_sk, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: '>10000', 1998, 'U', 9, 11, 'Children', 'Jewelry', 'Men', 35, 55, interval '3 day'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with same ordering (total_cnt DESC, then i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq ASC).
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity filter applied late after multiple joins (Index Scan on inventory with Filter).
- JOIN_ORDER_TRAP: EXPLAIN shows 7x Nested Loop joins with unstable order.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply deferring non-filtering dimensions (item, warehouse) to final step. Ignore the CTE isolation of date_dim (keep dates in core_filters).
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply pushing all selective filters into core_filters CTE. Ignore threshold pre-computation.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply explicit JOIN syntax (already present) and keep date filters together. Ignore comma-join conversion.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~326K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, inventory (join), warehouse (join), item (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), promotion (join), catalog_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq)
    ├── FILTER (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity)
    ├── FILTER (d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL '3 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (+6 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc ASC, w_warehouse_name ASC, d_week_seq ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
