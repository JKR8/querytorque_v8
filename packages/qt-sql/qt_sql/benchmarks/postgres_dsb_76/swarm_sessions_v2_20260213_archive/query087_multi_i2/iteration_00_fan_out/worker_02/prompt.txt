You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count distinct customer-date combinations present in store_sales but absent from both catalog_sales and web_sales, for customers born 1968-1974 during months 1213-1224, with list price 168-197 and wholesale cost 76-86 across all channels. INNER JOIN semantics require all three tables to match in each branch. No aggregation traps (only COUNT(*)). Filter dependencies: d_month_seq and c_birth_year filters apply identically to all three branches; price/wholesale_cost filters are channel-specific but same numeric ranges.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL may produce duplicates that affect COUNT aggregation (but original has DISTINCT per branch)
- Must ensure GROUP BY correctly handles potential duplicates from sales tables

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS restructuring (observed 0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXCEPT to NOT EXISTS changed NULL semantics and blocked hash anti-joins
   RULE: Preserve EXCEPT structure; do not convert to NOT EXISTS/NOT IN
2. CTE blocking parallelism (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs forced single-threaded execution on parallelizable fact scans
   RULE: Use non-materialized CTEs or ensure parallel-safe structure when fact tables are large
3. OR to UNION ALL splitting (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches lost bitmap index scan optimization
   RULE: Do not split channel-specific filters into UNION ALL; preserve per-branch structure

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output COUNT(*) as single column
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date for EXCEPT operations
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All numeric ranges (1213-1224, 168-197, 1968-1974, 76-86) must be preserved exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: EXCEPT semantics must be preserved (set difference, not anti-join with duplicates)
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: All three branches use comma-separated implicit joins (store_sales, date_dim, customer)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date_dim and customer filters applied three times independently

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply shared dimension CTEs across UNION ALL branches. Ignore different dimension tables (this query uses same dimensions).
- union_cte_split: Apply UNION ALL consolidation pattern. Ignore splitting aspect (we're consolidating, not splitting).

## Original SQL

```sql
select count(*)
from ((select distinct c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date
       from store_sales, date_dim, customer
       where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
         and store_sales.ss_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk
         and d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
         and ss_list_price between 168 and 197
         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974
         and ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 76 AND 86
         )

         and c_birth_year BETWEEN 1968 AND 1974

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 99%  Rows: ~55K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11)
    ├── FILTER (ws_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197)
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
