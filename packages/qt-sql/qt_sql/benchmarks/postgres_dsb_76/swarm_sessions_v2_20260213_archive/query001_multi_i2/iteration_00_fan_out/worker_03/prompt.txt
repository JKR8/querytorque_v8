You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers with high return amounts in 2000 compared to their store average, filtering for specific demographics and locations. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). The correlated subquery computes average returns PER STORE (grouping by ctr_store_sk), comparing individual customer returns against 1.2× that store average. The AVG must include ALL customers/reasons for that store, not just those matching the outer row's reason_sk filter. The ratio filter (sr_return_amt/sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 115 AND 174) must be applied BEFORE aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Customer ID not available in transitive_filtered_returns CTE - must join back to customer table in dimension_joins to get c_customer_id.
- Must verify that pushing customer/demographic filters into CTE doesn't change store average computation (shouldn't - store average still computed from filtered set).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly c_customer_id ordered ascending.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_reason_sk, ctr_total_return, plus join keys for dimensions).
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (2000, 115, 174, 17, 20, 'IA', 'KY', 'NE', 'S', '4 yr Degree', 'M', 4, 1987, 1993) must be preserved exactly.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 customer IDs in same order.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXPLAIN shows SubPlan executed 8,834 times (4.9ms each), scanning entire CTE each time.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins in CTE and main query, confusing cardinality estimation.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same CTE scanned twice (ctr1, ctr2) with predicate ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk applied late.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters into the CTE definition early. Also decorrelate by computing store averages separately. Ignore the multiple-branch aspect - single branch here.
- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply MATERIALIZED to CTEs to force early execution. Pre-filter both dimensions AND fact in same CTE. Ignore the non-equi join aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
         sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
         sr_reason_sk AS ctr_reason_sk,
         SUM(SR_REFUNDED_CASH) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 2001
    AND sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 236 AND 295
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk
)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer, customer_demographics
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2

      AND sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 236 AND 295
    GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk

  AND cd_gender = 'M'
  AND c_birth_month = 5
  AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1956
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
