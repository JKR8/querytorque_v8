You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers with high return amounts in 2000 compared to their store average, filtering for specific demographics and locations. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). The correlated subquery computes average returns PER STORE (grouping by ctr_store_sk), comparing individual customer returns against 1.2× that store average. The AVG must include ALL customers/reasons for that store, not just those matching the outer row's reason_sk filter. The ratio filter (sr_return_amt/sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 115 AND 174) must be applied BEFORE aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must maintain correlation semantics: subquery_cte must compute average per store from ALL returns_cte rows, not filtered ones.
- Explicit joins must preserve INNER JOIN semantics exactly.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

None applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly c_customer_id ordered ascending.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_reason_sk, ctr_total_return, plus join keys for dimensions).
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (2000, 115, 174, 17, 20, 'IA', 'KY', 'NE', 'S', '4 yr Degree', 'M', 4, 1987, 1993) must be preserved exactly.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 customer IDs in same order.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXPLAIN shows SubPlan executed 8,834 times (4.9ms each), scanning entire CTE each time.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins in CTE and main query, confusing cardinality estimation.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same CTE scanned twice (ctr1, ctr2) with predicate ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk applied late.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of ALL dimension tables into CTEs. Convert all comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax. Ignore the UNION aspect - no UNION here.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date_dim isolation into CTE AND convert to explicit JOINs. Also apply to other dimensions (store, customer, demographics).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
