You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Count sales events where web sales occur within 30 days of store sales for the same item and customer, with filters on item category, manager, customer state, and wholesale cost. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (implicit intersection) - all tables must match. Aggregation trap: Only COUNT(*), safe. Filter dependencies: The date range condition (d2 between d1 and d1+30) correlates two date dimensions; moving this before joins could change semantics if either date side is filtered out prematurely.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- generate_series may produce many rows; ensure date_dim join is efficient.
- MATERIALIZED CTEs may increase memory usage; set work_mem appropriately.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (0.21x regression on Q085):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches disabled bitmap index scans.
   RULE: Do NOT convert OR conditions (none in this query) to UNION ALL.
2. EXISTS to IN materialization (0.50x regression on Q069):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN with materialized CTEs blocked semi-join optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS/IN subqueries (none present).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, hd_vehicle_count, cnt exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., join keys, filter columns, grouping columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (2001, 'AZ','KS','OH','TX','WA', 35,55, etc.) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and order must match original.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins; EXPLAIN shows hash joins but comma joins may hinder estimation.
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Non-equi date range join uses nested loop filter; could benefit from staged reduction.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply staged reduction by pre-filtering fact (web_sales) and dimensions (item, customer) into MATERIALIZED CTEs before joining. Ignore the non-equi join on inventory quantity; ours is date range.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters into CTE definitions (customer, item). Ignore decorrelation aspect; we have no correlated subquery.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
