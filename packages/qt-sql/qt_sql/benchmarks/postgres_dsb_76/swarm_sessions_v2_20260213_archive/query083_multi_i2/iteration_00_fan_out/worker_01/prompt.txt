You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares return quantities across three sales channels (store, catalog, web) for specific items during four target dates in 1999. All three CTEs perform INNER JOINS requiring matches on both date and item dimensions. The aggregation uses only SUM, which is grouping-insensitive to duplicates. The arithmetic filter (return_amt/quantity between 253-282) depends on columns from the fact tables only and must be preserved exactly.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk of materialization overhead if dimension CTEs are very small (they are)
- Must use explicit JOIN syntax throughout, not comma joins

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR-to-UNION (0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL when PostgreSQL's bitmap scan could handle it efficiently
   RULE: Do NOT split the sr_reason_sk IN (...) or other IN lists into UNION ALL branches
2. EXISTS materialization (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE when semi-join with early termination was faster
   RULE: Keep the IN subquery structure for date filtering; optimizer already decorrelates it well

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 8 columns with exact aliases
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include columns referenced downstream (item_id for joins, quantity sums for calculations)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all date literals and filter values exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce identical rows and ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (EXPLAIN shows optimizer may misinterpret cardinalities)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date subquery executed 3 times (once per CTE in EXPLAIN plan)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of date and item into CTEs and explicit JOIN syntax; ignore the promotion dimension not present here
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Use date CTE isolation pattern but also create item CTE; convert all comma joins to explicit JOINs
- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Use MATERIALIZED keyword on dimension CTEs; but fact tables remain separate (not prefiltered into CTE)

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

### 3. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
