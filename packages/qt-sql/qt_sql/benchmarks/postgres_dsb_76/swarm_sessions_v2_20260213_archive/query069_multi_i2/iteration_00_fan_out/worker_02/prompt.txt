You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers in specific states with certain demographics who purchased via stores in Q2 1999 but did NOT purchase via web or catalog in the same period, then counts them by demographic attributes. JOIN semantics are INNER between customer, address, demographics; EXISTS requires at least one matching store_sales row; NOT EXISTS requires NO matching web_sales or catalog_sales rows (anti-join). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is duplicate-sensitive but grouping-insensitive. Filter dependencies: address state, demographic statuses, date range (1999, months 3-5), price ranges (52-141) must all be preserved exactly.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- DISTINCT in fact CTEs adds overhead but reduces anti-join probe size.
- LEFT JOIN + NULL check may not use hash anti-join efficiently.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Converting EXISTS to IN/NOT IN (observed regression 0.50x on Q069):
   CAUSE: NOT IN with NULLs blocks hash anti-joins and changes NULL semantics.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS to IN/NOT IN; keep as EXISTS or convert to explicit ANTI JOIN.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 8 columns exactly as in original SELECT lines 2-9.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include c_customer_sk for joins, plus all demographic columns for GROUP BY and SELECT.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All filter values (states: 'GA','KY','SD'; marital: 'D','W','U'; education: 'Primary','College'; year: 1999; months: 3-5; prices: 52-141) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with same grouping counts.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins `customer c, customer_address ca, customer_demographics` - evidence from EXPLAIN shows sequential scan planning.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are correlated subqueries - evidence from EXPLAIN shows nested loop anti-joins with materialized inner scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- decorrelate: Decouple correlated subqueries by pre-computing customer sets per channel. Apply DISTINCT to get unique customers per channel.
- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate three fact scans into independent CTEs that compute once. Ignore CASE aggregation aspect.
- pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Use MATERIALIZED CTEs for fact table pre-filtering. Apply to store_customers, web_customers, catalog_customers CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 2. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~500K
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (ca_state IN ('GA', 'KY', 'SD'))
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status IN ('D', 'W', 'U'))
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_education_status ASC, cd_purchase_estimate ASC, cd_credit_rating ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
