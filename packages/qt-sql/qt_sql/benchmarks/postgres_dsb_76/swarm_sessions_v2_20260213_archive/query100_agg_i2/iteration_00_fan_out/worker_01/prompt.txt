You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find pairs of items (item1 < item2) sold together in the same transaction (ticket) during 1999-2000, where item1 is Electronics/Men, item2 has manager_id 44-63, both items priced 115-129, bought by divorced college-educated customers, and count transaction frequency. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). COUNT(*) is duplicate-safe. The non-equi join (item1 < item2) must be preserved to avoid duplicate pairs.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CTEs may block parallel execution on sales_base_cte (248K rows)
- Multiple self-reference of sales_base_cte may cause re-materialization

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Avoid CTEs that block parallel execution (observed regression: 0.21x):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: For store_sales CTEs >100K rows, avoid MATERIALIZED unless proven beneficial
2. Never split OR conditions into UNION ALL (observed regression: 0.21x):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN already optimizes multi-branch ORs
   RULE: Keep item1.i_category IN ('Electronics', 'Men') as single condition

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output item1.i_item_sk, item2.i_item_sk, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include ss_ticket_number, ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk, ss_list_price, d_date_sk, c_current_addr_sk, c_current_cdemo_sk for downstream joins
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all filter values: 1999, 1999+1, 'Electronics', 'Men', 44, 63, 'D', 'College', 115, 129
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same pairs with same counts
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (EXPLAIN shows optimizer already using explicit join types but cardinality estimation may suffer)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: store_sales scanned twice (EXPLAIN shows s1 and s2 as separate scans)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk applied late after all dimension joins (EXPLAIN shows "Join Filter" in Nested Loop)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering all selective dimensions (date, item1, item2, cd) into CTEs; convert comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax; ignore the promotion table reference.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date CTE isolation; combine with explicit JOIN syntax for all tables; ignore the single-dimension focus (we need multiple dimension CTEs).
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early dimension filter pushdown into CTE definitions; ignore decorrelation aspect (no correlated subqueries).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~744K
    ├── SCAN (item AS item1 (join), item AS item2 (join), store_sales AS s1 (join), store_sales AS s2 (join), date_dim (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (s1.ss_ticket_number = s2.ss_ticket_number)
    ├── JOIN (s1.ss_item_sk = item1.i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+5 more)
    ├── FILTER (item1.i_item_sk < item2.i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 1999 + 1)
    ├── FILTER (+6 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cnt ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_sk, i_item_sk, cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
