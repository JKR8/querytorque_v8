You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: find excess discount amounts where the discount exceeds 130% of the average discount for that item during a 90-day period, for items meeting manufacturer or category criteria, with wholesale cost constraints. JOIN semantics: INNER joins between web_sales, item, and date_dim (all sides must match). Aggregation trap: Subquery computes AVG per item (correlated on i_item_sk); decorrelation must preserve per-item grouping without introducing duplicates. Filter dependencies: The date filter ('2002-03-06' to +90 days) and wholesale_cost filter (16-36) apply to BOTH main query and subquery; the price ratio filter (ws_sales_price/ws_list_price BETWEEN 35*0.01 AND 50*0.01) applies ONLY to subquery.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure item_avg CTE computes average PER ITEM (GROUP BY ws_item_sk) to match correlation.
- price ratio filter (ws_sales_price/ws_list_price) applies ONLY to subquery, not main fact_prefilter.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR condition into UNION ALL branches bypassed PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN optimization.
   RULE: Do NOT split the item OR condition (i_manufact_id BETWEEN 566 AND 765 OR i_category IN (...)) into UNION ALL.
2. EXISTS to IN materialization (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN with materialized CTE blocked hash anti-joins.
   RULE: Not applicable - query has no EXISTS.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly one column "Excess Discount Amount" as SUM.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include i_item_sk, ws_item_sk, d_date_sk, ws_ext_discount_amt for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '2002-03-06', interval '90 day', category values, numeric bounds exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same sum of ws_ext_discount_amt over same filtered rows.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Subquery correlated on i_item_sk re-executes per outer row.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Implicit comma joins in both main query and subquery.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same web_sales+date_dim scan appears in main and subquery.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- inline_decorrelate_materialized: Apply 3-CTE decomposition (dimension filter, fact filter, per-key aggregate). Ignore timeout context - we have no timeout.
- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early dimension filtering into CTEs. Ignore limited benefit warning - correlation overhead is primary bottleneck.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply date CTE isolation AND convert to explicit JOINs. Ignore that example doesn't have correlation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

**BEFORE (slow):**

select  sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount"
from
   catalog_sales
   ,item
   ,date_dim
where
(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales
           ,date_dim
         where
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk

          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
          and cs_list_price between 16 and 45
          and cs_sales_price / cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
      )

           cs.cs_list_price, cs.cs_sales_price

    JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'

    SELECT dfs.cs_item_sk,

    JOIN filtered_items fi ON fi.i_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
    WHERE dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 16 AND 45
      AND dfs.cs_sales_price / dfs.cs_list_price BETWEEN 63 * 0.01 AND 83 * 0.01
    GROUP BY dfs.cs_item_sk

JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

```

### 3. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ws_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER ((i_manufact_id BETWEEN 566 AND 765 OR i_category IN ('Children', 'Jewelry', 'Men')))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-03-06' AND CAST('2002-03-06' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (Excess Discount Amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
