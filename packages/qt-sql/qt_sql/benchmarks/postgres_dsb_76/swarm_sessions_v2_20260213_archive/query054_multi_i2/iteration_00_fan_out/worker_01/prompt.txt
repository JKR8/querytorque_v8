You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Identify customer segments based on store sales revenue, where customers previously purchased curtain/drape items in 1998 May via catalog/web channels at wholesale cost $70-100 and were born 1942-1955. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (all dimension tables must match). Aggregation traps: None (only SUM and COUNT). Filter dependencies: my_customers filters (item, date, customer birth year) must remain connected to the UNION branches; my_revenue date range depends on the same month/year as my_customers date filter.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-filtering dimensions may reduce parallelism within sales_union_cte (CTE materialization prevents parallel scan of catalog_sales/web_sales).
- UNION ALL branches may have different join selectivities; explicit JOINs may change join order.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs prevent parallel table scans within the CTE.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping entire fact+dimension joins in a single CTE if parallel scan on large fact tables is beneficial.
2. Splitting OR into UNION ALL (observed 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN handles multi-branch ORs efficiently; splitting loses bitmap combination.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions in WHERE clauses; this query has no OR conditions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output segment, num_customers, segment_base in same order.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: my_customers must output c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk; my_revenue must output c_customer_sk, revenue.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All string/numeric literals (e.g., 'Home', 'curtains/drapes', 1998, 5, 70, 100, state list) must be exact.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by segment, num_customers.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: my_customers uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows Nested Loop with many iterations.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Two identical correlated subqueries for d_month_seq; EXPLAIN shows two separate Index Only Scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: apply pre-filtering date_dim and item into CTEs and explicit JOINs; ignore promotion dimension not present.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: isolate date_dim filter into CTE and convert comma joins to explicit JOINs; ignore that example uses only date_dim.
- early_filter_decorrelate: push dimension filters into CTE definitions; ignore decorrelation aspect (we handle separately).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 3. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
