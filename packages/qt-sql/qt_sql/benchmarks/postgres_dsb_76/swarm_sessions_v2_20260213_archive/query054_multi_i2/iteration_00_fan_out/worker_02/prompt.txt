You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Identify customer segments based on store sales revenue, where customers previously purchased curtain/drape items in 1998 May via catalog/web channels at wholesale cost $70-100 and were born 1942-1955. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (all dimension tables must match). Aggregation traps: None (only SUM and COUNT). Filter dependencies: my_customers filters (item, date, customer birth year) must remain connected to the UNION branches; my_revenue date range depends on the same month/year as my_customers date filter.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

date_dim_cte -> month_seq_cte -> my_customers -> my_revenue -> segments -> main
NODE_CONTRACTS:

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CROSS JOIN month_seq_cte may multiply rows if month_seq_cte has >1 row (but it should have 1 row since d_moy=5, d_year=1998 yields one month). Use LIMIT 1 or ensure uniqueness.
- Materializing month_seq_cte may add overhead if inlined.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs prevent parallel table scans within the CTE.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping entire fact+dimension joins in a single CTE if parallel scan on large fact tables is beneficial.
2. Splitting OR into UNION ALL (observed 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's BITMAP_OR_SCAN handles multi-branch ORs efficiently; splitting loses bitmap combination.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions in WHERE clauses; this query has no OR conditions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output segment, num_customers, segment_base in same order.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: my_customers must output c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk; my_revenue must output c_customer_sk, revenue.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All string/numeric literals (e.g., 'Home', 'curtains/drapes', 1998, 5, 70, 100, state list) must be exact.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by segment, num_customers.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: my_customers uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows Nested Loop with many iterations.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Two identical correlated subqueries for d_month_seq; EXPLAIN shows two separate Index Only Scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- inline_decorrelate_materialized: apply decorrelation via MATERIALIZED CTE for month_seq values; ignore the 3-CTE decomposition (we only need one).
- early_filter_decorrelate: pre-compute thresholds in separate CTE; ignore early filtering of other dimensions.
- pg_date_cte_explicit_join: isolate date_dim filter; ignore explicit join conversion.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. inline_decorrelate_materialized (timeout_rescue)

**Principle:** Inline Decorrelation with MATERIALIZED CTEs: When a WHERE clause contains a correlated scalar subquery (e.g., col > (SELECT 1.3 * avg(col) FROM ... WHERE correlated_key = outer.key)), PostgreSQL re-executes the subquery per outer row. Fix: decompose into 3 MATERIALIZED CTEs — (1) pre-filter dimension table, (2) pre-filter fact table by date range, (3) compute per-key aggregate threshold from filtered data — then JOIN the threshold CTE in the final query. MATERIALIZED keyword prevents PG from inlining the CTEs back into correlated form.

(i_manufact_id in (1, 78, 97, 516, 521)
or i_manager_id BETWEEN 25 and 54)
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
and d_date between '1999-03-07' and
        cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
and cs_ext_discount_amt
     > (
         select
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)
         from
            catalog_sales

              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk

          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk

    JOIN date_dim d ON d.d_date_sk = cs.cs_sold_date_sk
    WHERE d.d_date BETWEEN '1999-03-07' AND cast('1999-03-07' as date) + interval '90 day'

JOIN item_avg_discount iad ON iad.cs_item_sk = dfs.cs_item_sk
WHERE dfs.cs_ext_discount_amt > iad.threshold
ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

```

### 3. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
