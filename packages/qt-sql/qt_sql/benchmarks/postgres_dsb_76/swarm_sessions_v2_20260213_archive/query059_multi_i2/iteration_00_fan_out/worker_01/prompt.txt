You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares year-over-year sales ratios per day of week for stores in 8 states, comparing weeks 52 weeks apart. JOIN semantics: INNER joins throughout - all sides must match. Aggregation trap: None - uses SUM with CASE which is duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: The date range filters (d_month_seq 1183-1194 vs 1195-1206) must remain separate per year; state filter applies to both years.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Store join may increase CTE row count if one store_sk maps to multiple stores (unlikely but verify).
- Must ensure GROUP BY includes s_store_id and s_store_name for downstream join.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. No regression warnings applicable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1, and 7 ratio columns exactly as original.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_week_seq, ss_store_sk, all 7 sales columns, plus s_store_id and s_store_name if store is joined.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact values: 1183, 1183+11, 1183+12, 1183+23, and state list ('AR','GA','IN','KS','KY','OH','SD','VA').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated joins in CTE (line 11) and derived tables (lines 26, 38), confusing PostgreSQL's cardinality estimation.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Selective date filters (d_month_seq ranges) not pushed into CTE definition, applied after aggregation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early filtering of date_dim and store into CTE before joining with fact table. IGNORE the decorrelation aspect - this query has no correlated subqueries.
- pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of dimension tables (date_dim, store) before joining with fact table. IGNORE the multi-channel aspect - this query has two years but not multiple fact tables.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] wss  [=]  Cost: 52%  Rows: ~4.0M
│   ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim (join))
│   ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
│   ├── FILTER (ss_sales_price / ss_list_price BETWEEN 65 * 0.01 AND 85 * 0.01)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (d_week_seq, ss_store_sk, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, ...)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 48%  Rows: ~629K
    ├── SCAN (wss, store, date_dim AS d (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_id1 = s_store_id2)
    ├── JOIN (d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 52)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name1 ASC, s_store_id1 ASC, d_week_seq1 ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1, sun_sales1 / sun_sales2, mon_sales1 / mon_sales2, tue_sales1 / tue_sales2, wed_sales1 / wed_sales2, thu_sales1 / thu_sales2, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
