You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query compares per-item revenue across three sales channels (store, catalog, web) for customers born 1985-1991, focusing on items with list price 168-197 and manager_id 42-71 during the same month as 2001-06-06. It returns items where all three channel revenues are within 10% of each other. JOIN semantics are INNER: all three CTEs must match on (item_id, birth_year). Aggregates are SUMs, safe for restructuring. The date subquery depends on outer date_dim; breaking this correlation must preserve the set of dates for that month_seq.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
dim_cte -> ss_items -> cs_items -> ws_items -> main_query
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  dim_cte:
    FROM: item
    JOIN: CROSS JOIN customer
          CROSS JOIN (SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq = (SELECT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_date = '2001-06-06')) AS date_filter
    WHERE: i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991
    OUTPUT: i_item_sk, i_item_id, c_customer_sk, c_birth_year, d_date_sk, d_date
    EXPECTED_ROWS: (item rows × customer rows × 30 dates) filtered by manager_id and birth_year
    CONSUMERS: ss_items, cs_items, ws_items
  ss_items:

    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
    GROUP BY: dim_cte.i_item_id, dim_cte.c_birth_year
    AGGREGATE: SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    OUTPUT: dim_cte.i_item_id AS item_id, dim_cte.c_birth_year AS birth_year, ss_item_rev
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~54K
    CONSUMERS: main_query
  cs_items, ws_items: similar with respective fact tables and customer key.

NODE_CONTRACTS:
dim_cte:
    FROM: item
    JOIN: CROSS JOIN customer
          CROSS JOIN (SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq = (SELECT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_date = '2001-06-06')) AS date_filter
    WHERE: i_manager_id BETWEEN 42 AND 71
      AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1991
    OUTPUT: i_item_sk, i_item_id, c_customer_sk, c_birth_year, d_date_sk, d_date
    EXPECTED_ROWS: (item rows × customer rows × 30 dates) filtered by manager_id and birth_year
    CONSUMERS: ss_items, cs_items, ws_items
  ss_items:
    FROM: store_sales
    JOIN: INNER JOIN dim_cte ON ss_item_sk = dim_cte.i_item_sk
           AND ss_sold_date_sk = dim_cte.d_date_sk
           AND ss_customer_sk = dim_cte.c_customer_sk
    WHERE: ss_list_price BETWEEN 168 AND 197
    GROUP BY: dim_cte.i_item_id, dim_cte.c_birth_year
    AGGREGATE: SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ss_item_rev
    OUTPUT: dim_cte.i_item_id AS item_id, dim_cte.c_birth_year AS birth_year, ss_item_rev
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~54K
    CONSUMERS: main_query
  cs_items, ws_items: similar with respective fact tables and customer key.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Cross-join in dim_cte could explode if filters are not selective (but they are). Must ensure WHERE clauses are applied before cross-join.
- Output columns must include all dimension keys for fact joins.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. OR to UNION ALL (observed 0.21x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL branches prevented bitmap index combination.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions in this query—there are no OR conditions.
2. EXISTS to IN (observed 0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN changed join type and blocked hash anti-join.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS—this query has no EXISTS.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 9 columns (item_id, birth_year, ss_item_rev, ss_dev, cs_item_rev, cs_dev, ws_item_rev, ws_dev, average) in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Dimension CTEs must output i_item_sk, i_item_id, c_customer_sk, c_birth_year, d_date_sk, d_date for downstream fact joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep all literal values: '2001-06-06', 168, 197, 42, 71, 1985, 1991, 0.9, 1.1.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows must be identical to original.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTEs use comma-separated joins, causing poor cardinality estimation (EXPLAIN shows sequential scans on date_dim).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Date subquery is correlated; EXPLAIN shows hash semi-join but still scans date_dim twice per CTE.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same dimension filters repeated across three CTEs (EXPLAIN shows 3× scans of item and customer).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply shared dimension CTE across multiple fact tables; ignore the UNION ALL branch splitting.
  pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Apply MATERIALIZED to dim_cte to pre-filter dimensions; ignore the fact table pre-filtering (we keep fact filters in separate CTEs).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
