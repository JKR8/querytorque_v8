**Changes:**
- `[+]` Added CTE `main_query_explicit_joins` as per target tree
- `[~]` Converted comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax  
- `[=]` Kept OR conditions intact (no UNION splitting)
- `[=]` Preserved all filters and defensive guards

**Changes:** Converted implicit comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax while preserving all OR conditions intact. The CTE isolates the join logic and outputs exactly the three columns needed for aggregation.

**Expected speedup:** Moderate (1.2-1.5x) due to clearer join hints for PostgreSQL optimizer, while avoiding the bitmap-scan regression risk of splitting ORs. The explicit join syntax helps PostgreSQL correctly estimate cardinalities and choose better join orders.
