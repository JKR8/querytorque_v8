You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Analyze music sales in 1999 for female college graduates born in December living in AR, IN, or VA, with wholesale cost $5-10. All joins are INNER (must match all dimension conditions). Aggregates are AVG (sensitive to row duplication from joins). Filters on customer_demographics (gender, education), customer (birth month), customer_address (state), date_dim (year), item (category), and catalog_sales (wholesale cost) must all be satisfied for each row.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Minimal change may not improve performance significantly.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines explicit JOINs with parallel hints)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression: 0.5x):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel table scans.
   RULE: Avoid wrapping large fact table scans in CTEs; keep them in main query for parallel execution.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, and 6 AVG aggregates.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, group-by columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact filter values: 'F', '4 yr Degree', 1999, 12, ('AR','IN','VA'), 5-10, 'Music'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and aggregates.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (PostgreSQL cardinality estimation weakness).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply explicit JOIN syntax conversion only. Ignore the CTE isolation - keep all tables in main FROM.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select 
   substring(w_warehouse_name,1,20)
  ,sm_type
  ,cc_name
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 30 ) then 1 else 0 end)  as "30 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 30) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 60) then 1 else 0 end )  as "31-60 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 60) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 90) then 1 else 0 end)  as "61-90 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk > 90) and
                 (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk <= 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as "91-120 days"
  ,sum(case when (cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk  > 120) then 1 else 0 end)  as ">120 days"

## Per-Rewrite Configuration (SET LOCAL)

You have two optimization levers: SQL rewrite AND per-query configuration.
After writing your rewrite, analyze its execution profile and emit SET LOCAL
commands that fix planner-level bottlenecks specific to YOUR rewrite.

Memory budget: shared_buffers=128MB, effective_cache_size=4GB
Global work_mem: 4MB (per-operation)
Active connections: ~1 (work_mem headroom: safe up to 16MB per-op)
Storage: HDD (random_page_cost=4.0)
Parallel capacity: max_parallel_workers=8, per_gather=2

SET LOCAL permissions:
  user-level (always available): effective_cache_size, enable_hashjoin, enable_mergejoin, enable_nestloop, enable_seqscan, from_collapse_limit, geqo_threshold, hash_mem_multiplier, jit, jit_above_cost, join_collapse_limit, max_parallel_workers_per_gather, parallel_setup_cost, parallel_tuple_cost, random_page_cost, work_mem

### Tunable Parameters (whitelist — only these are allowed)

- **effective_cache_size** (1024MB–65536MB): Advisory: how much OS cache to expect (MB). Safe to set aggressively.
- **enable_hashjoin** (on | off): Enable hash join plan type.
- **enable_mergejoin** (on | off): Enable merge join plan type.
- **enable_nestloop** (on | off): Enable nested-loop join plan type.
- **enable_seqscan** (on | off): Enable sequential scan plan type.
- **from_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before subqueries stop being flattened.
- **geqo_threshold** (2–20): Number of FROM items that triggers genetic query optimizer.
- **hash_mem_multiplier** (1.0–10.0): Multiplier applied to work_mem for hash-based operations.
- **jit** (on | off): Enable JIT compilation.
- **jit_above_cost** (0.0–1000000.0): Query cost above which JIT is activated.
- **join_collapse_limit** (1–20): Max FROM items before planner stops trying all join orders.
- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather** (0–8): Max parallel workers per Gather node.
- **parallel_setup_cost** (0.0–10000.0): Planner estimate of cost to launch parallel workers.
- **parallel_tuple_cost** (0.0–1.0): Planner estimate of cost to transfer a tuple to parallel worker.
- **random_page_cost** (1.0–10.0): Planner estimate of cost of a random page fetch (1.0 = SSD, 4.0 = HDD).
- **work_mem** (64MB–2048MB): Memory for sorts/hashes per operation (MB). Allocated PER-OPERATION, not per-query. Count hash/sort ops in EXPLAIN before sizing.

### Rules
- Every SET LOCAL MUST cite a specific EXPLAIN node your rewrite creates/changes
- work_mem is PER-OPERATION: count hash/sort ops in your rewrite before sizing
- random_page_cost: ONLY change if your rewrite creates index-favorable access patterns
- Empty is valid: if your rewrite has no planner bottleneck, emit no SET LOCAL
- Stay within the resource envelope bounds above

### SET LOCAL Syntax
Include SET LOCAL commands in the `runtime_config` array field of your JSON output.
If no config changes help, omit the field or use an empty array.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `ca_country`
  3. `ca_state`
  4. `ca_county`
  5. `agg1`
  6. `agg2`
  7. `agg3`
  8. `agg4`
  9. `agg5`
  10. `agg6`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~135K
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, customer_demographics (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_education_status = '4 yr Degree')
    ├── FILTER (+5 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_country ASC, ca_state ASC, ca_county ASC, i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
