You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers who made purchases across store and web channels within 90 days, with specific product categories and demographic filters. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is safe to restructuring. The date window filter (d2 between d1 and d1+90) creates a temporal dependency between the store return date and web sale date.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- MATERIALIZED CTEs may block parallel execution of dimension scans (though they're small)
- Date window filter applied very late may still be expensive
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines explicit JOINs, MATERIALIZED dimension CTEs, and late date window filter)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression 0.50x on Q045):
   CAUSE: Materialized CTEs executed single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: For fact table scans (store_sales, store_returns, web_sales), avoid wrapping in MATERIALIZED CTEs if they would benefit from parallel scans
2. Nestloop disable on selective lookups (observed regression 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: SET enable_nestloop=off forced hash joins for small selective lookups, increasing overhead
   RULE: Preserve optimizer's choice of nested loops for indexed lookups on highly selective filters

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include customer keys, date keys, item keys, and any columns used in downstream joins/filters
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'), ca_state IN ('AR', 'CO', 'NC', 'NY', 'TX'), d1.d_year=1998, hd_income_band_sk BETWEEN 7 AND 13, hd_buy_potential='0-500', ss_sales_price/ss_list_price BETWEEN 35*0.01 AND 55*0.01
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 0 rows with same grouping and ordering
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (FROM store_sales, store_returns, web_sales...)
- NON_EQUI_JOIN_INPUT_BLINDNESS: Date window condition applied as late Join Filter in Nested Loop

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of all dimensions into MATERIALIZED CTEs; use explicit JOIN syntax throughout; ignore the UNION ALL pattern.
  pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Materialize both date dimensions separately; apply date window filter late as in original but with explicit joins; ignore the single-date-dimension optimization.
  pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter: Use MATERIALIZED CTEs for all dimension tables to force early execution and create tiny hash tables; keep fact tables outside CTEs to allow parallel scans; ignore the fact table prefiltering aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

### 3. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~890K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), web_sales (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), item (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), household_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number)
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+8 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_category IN ('Children', 'Electronics', 'Music'))
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_date BETWEEN d1.d_date AND (d1.d_date + INTERVAL '90 DAY'))
    ├── FILTER (+5 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cnt ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_customer_sk, c_first_name, c_last_name, cnt)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
