You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query computes call center returns loss for February 1998, filtering customers by specific marital/education status combinations, household buying potential, and timezone offset. All joins are INNER (all sides must match). The SUM aggregate is grouping-insensitive, so restructuring that changes row multiplicity (through different join orders) is safe. The OR condition on customer demographics is a single filter that must be applied before grouping.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pushing too many filters into JOIN conditions may overwhelm PostgreSQL's join reordering
- Must ensure all joins remain INNER to preserve semantics

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in Q042):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of catalog_returns
   RULE: Use non-materialized CTEs or ensure catalog_returns scan remains outside CTEs
2. Splitting OR into UNION ALL (observed 0.21x on Q085):
   CAUSE: PostgreSQL's bitmap OR scan handles OR conditions efficiently; splitting loses this optimization
   RULE: Keep the OR condition intact as single filter

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, sum(cr_net_loss) as Returns_Loss
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: cr_net_loss, cc_* columns, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literal values: d_year=1998, d_moy=2, cd_marital_status='M'/'W', cd_education_status='Unknown'/'Advanced Degree', hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%', ca_gmt_offset=-7
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows ordered by sum(cr_net_loss) DESC
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins (EXPLAIN shows comma joins in original SQL)
- GLOBAL_GUARD_RAIL_4: Avoid CTEs for small dimension lookups (<10K rows) - but date_dim has 28 rows, call_center 24 rows

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

early_filter_decorrelate: Apply early filtering by pushing all dimension filters into the JOIN conditions rather than WHERE clause. Ignore the decorrelation aspect (no correlated subqueries).
pushdown: Push predicates as close to table scans as possible via JOIN conditions. Ignore any CTE materialization aspects.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~2.2M
    ├── SCAN (call_center, catalog_returns (join), date_dim (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+4 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 1998)
    ├── FILTER (d_moy = 2)
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC)
    └── OUTPUT (Call_Center, Call_Center_Name, Manager, Returns_Loss)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
