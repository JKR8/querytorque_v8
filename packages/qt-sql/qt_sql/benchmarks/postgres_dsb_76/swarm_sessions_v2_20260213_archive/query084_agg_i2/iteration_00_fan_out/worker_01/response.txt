Changes: Converted comma-separated joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax to enable better join planning while preserving all filters, literals, and the exact output structure.

Expected speedup: Moderate (1.5-2x) due to clearer join relationships allowing PostgreSQL's optimizer to choose optimal join order and potentially use hash joins more effectively. No CTEs were introduced to avoid parallelism blocking.
