You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query computes shipping cost and net profit for web sales orders within a 60-day period that ship to 6 US states, from websites in GMT offset >= -5, with list price between 237 and 266, where the same order was fulfilled from multiple warehouses and was not returned for 5 specific reasons. JOIN semantics are INNER: all dimension tables must match, and the EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are semi/anti-joins. Aggregation traps: COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) is sensitive to duplicate order numbers from joins; the current plan uses semi/anti-joins so no duplication. Filter dependencies: The date filter on date_dim must apply before joining to web_sales; the state filter on customer_address and GMT offset on web_site are independent.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The filtered_wr_cte depends on filtered_ws1_cte, creating a circular reference if not defined as LATERAL or separate CTE. Must define filtered_ws1_cte first, then filtered_wr_cte referencing it.
- May increase complexity; ensure the join between filtered_ws1_cte and web_returns is efficient.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: The exploration does not violate any correctness constraints; it attempts to reduce the hash table size by propagating the date filter through the join chain.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Never split OR conditions into UNION ALL (observed regression 0.21x):
   CAUSE: Query has no OR conditions over different dimension keys; splitting would add overhead.
   RULE: Do not apply OR-to-UNION to this query.
2. Never convert EXISTS to IN/NOT IN (observed regression 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Optimizer already converts EXISTS to efficient semi-joins; manual conversion may block optimizations.
   RULE: Keep EXISTS as semi-join; do not convert to IN.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output three columns: order count, total shipping cost, total net profit.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ws_order_number, ws_ext_ship_cost, ws_net_profit, ws_warehouse_sk, ws_ship_date_sk, ws_ship_addr_sk, ws_web_site_sk, ws_list_price, and dimension keys.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values for date range, state list, reason_sk list, list price range, GMT offset.
- CORRECTNESS_CONSTRAINT_ID: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY count distinct, LIMIT 100).
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses comma-separated implicit joins; EXPLAIN shows optimizer reordered joins but may have suboptimal cardinality estimates.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: SELF_JOIN_ELIMINATION: EXISTS subquery is a self-join on web_sales; optimizer uses index-only scan but per-row correlation remains.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Apply the idea of pre-filtering the web_returns table by joining with filtered fact data. Ignore the decorrelation of a scalar subquery; here we are filtering an anti-join.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~101K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales AS ws1 (join), date_dim (join), customer_address (join), web_site (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-9-01' AND CAST('2002-9-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (ca_state IN ('CA', 'MI', 'OH', 'SD', 'TX', 'VA'))
    ├── FILTER (+4 more)
    ├── SORT (COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (order count, total shipping cost, total net profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
