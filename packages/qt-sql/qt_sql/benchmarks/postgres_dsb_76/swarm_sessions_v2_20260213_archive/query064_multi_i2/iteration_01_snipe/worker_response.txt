**Changes**: Combined dimension prefetching with explicit JOIN syntax and single-pass year aggregation. Pre-filtered selective dimensions into tiny CTEs, converted comma-joins to explicit JOINs, and computed both years in one pass using conditional aggregation to avoid self-join.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x by eliminating the expensive self-join, reducing catalog_sales scan via early item filtering, and enabling better hash join planning with explicit JOIN syntax.
