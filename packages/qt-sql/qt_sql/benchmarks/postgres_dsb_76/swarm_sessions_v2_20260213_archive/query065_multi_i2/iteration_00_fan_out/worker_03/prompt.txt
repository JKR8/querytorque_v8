You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find stores in KS, OH, or SD selling items managed by managers 10–14 where the item's total revenue (over a year of sales with a 79–89% discount) is ≤10% of the store's average item revenue for that period. Report store name, item details, and pricing. All joins are INNER: a result row exists only when all joined tables match. Aggregates SUM and AVG are duplicate-insensitive given the grouping keys. The 0.1 multiplier filter depends on the per-store average computed from the same fact data; any rewrite must preserve exact group membership for both aggregations.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Deferring item join may cause missed index usage if item filter is highly selective (i_manager_id). Ensure item join uses index on i_item_sk and i_manager_id.
- The store filter (s_state) is applied late; consider pushing into store_sales_filtered if possible via join.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. CTE blocking parallelism (observed regression in SF-005):
   CAUSE: Materializing CTEs can prevent parallel execution of inner scans.
   RULE: Avoid MATERIALIZED unless necessary for decorrelation; prefer non-materialized CTEs or subqueries to preserve parallel plans.
2. Over-aggressive predicate pushdown (observed regression in SF-009):
   CAUSE: Pushing complex filters (price ratio) into CTEs can inhibit index-only scans.
   RULE: Keep simple equality filters (date_dim) in CTEs, apply computed filters later if they block index usage.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output s_store_name, i_item_desc, revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk, revenue for downstream joins and filters.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_month_seq 1215–1226, price ratio 0.79–0.89, i_manager_id 10–14, s_state KS/OH/SD.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (by s_store_name, i_item_desc, limit 100).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows two separate store_sales scans with identical filters (date_dim join + price ratio). Materializing once would eliminate duplicate work.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Original uses comma joins; EXPLAIN shows optimizer converts to explicit joins but cardinality estimation may still suffer from lack of pre-filtered dimension CTEs.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply early filtering of date_dim and store, but defer item join until after revenue filtering. Ignore decorrelation aspects—no correlated subqueries here.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~110K
    ├── SCAN (store, item (join), store_sales (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave)
    ├── FILTER (i_manager_id BETWEEN 10 AND 14)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC, i_item_desc ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, i_item_desc, revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
