You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find shipping metrics for web orders within a 60-day window where: (a) the order ships to one of six US states, (b) the website is in timezone GMT-5 or later, (c) list price is between $253-$282, (d) the order was fulfilled from at least two different warehouses, and (e) the order was not returned for any of five specific reasons. All joins are INNER (must match), and COUNT(DISTINCT) requires preserving exact order set. The NOT EXISTS with wr_reason_sk IN list must reject orders with ANY matching reason.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CTEs may block parallel execution on web_sales scan (base_sales could lose parallelism)
- Must ensure web_sales join order doesn't change predicate pushdown of ws_list_price

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS to IN/NOT IN (observed 0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to IN with large result set forces materialization and loses semi-join early termination
   RULE: Preserve EXISTS structure; if decorrelating, use JOIN with DISTINCT or GROUP BY instead of IN
2. CTE blocking parallelism (observed 0.8x regression):
   CAUSE: MATERIALIZED CTEs execute single-threaded, preventing parallel scan of large fact tables
   RULE: Avoid wrapping large fact table scans in CTEs; keep them in main query for parallel execution

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly three columns: order count, total shipping cost, total net profit
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ws_order_number, ws_ext_ship_cost, ws_net_profit, join keys)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact date '1999-10-01', interval '60 day', state list, price range 253-282, reason_sk values 8,18,20,23,41
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and aggregation values
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: Query uses implicit comma joins (lines 6-9), causing poor cardinality estimation
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: web_sales scanned twice (ws1 for main, ws2 for EXISTS) - opportunity for shared materialization

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

pg_dimension_prefetch_star: Apply pre-filtering of ALL three dimension tables into CTEs; convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax; ignore the UNION ALL aspect (not needed).
  pg_date_cte_explicit_join: Apply the date CTE pattern AND explicit JOIN conversion; ignore the single-dimension focus - we need all three dimensions.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

### 2. pg_date_cte_explicit_join (2.28x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation + Explicit Joins: materialize selective dimension filters into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, AND convert comma-separated joins to explicit JOIN syntax. On PostgreSQL, the combination enables better hash join planning with a tiny probe table.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~154K
    ├── SCAN (web_sales AS ws1 (join), date_dim (join), customer_address (join), web_site (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '1999-10-01' AND CAST('1999-10-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60 DAY')
    ├── FILTER (ca_state IN ('MO', 'MT', 'OK', 'SC', 'TX', 'WI'))
    ├── FILTER (+4 more)
    ├── SORT (COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (order count, total shipping cost, total net profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "runtime_config": ["SET LOCAL work_mem = '512MB'"],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
