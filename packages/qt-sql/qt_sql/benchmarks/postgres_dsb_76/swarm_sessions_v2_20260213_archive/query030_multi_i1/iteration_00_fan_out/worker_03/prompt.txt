You are a SQL rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1). Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customers born 1945-1951 living in CA/MI/SD/VA whose 1999 web returns (for items managed by managers 42-51 with return amount/quantity ratio 193-222) for reasons 22 or 23 exceed 120% of their state's average return amount for ALL reasons. INNER JOIN semantics: all dimension tables must match. Aggregation trap: AVG in correlated subquery is computed per state across ALL reason_sk values, while the outer query filters to reasons 22,23. Filter dependency: The state filter (CA/MI/SD/VA) appears in main query but could be pushed into CTE.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pushing wr_reason_sk IN (22,23) into CTE changes the CTE's semantics: the state average in correlated subquery must still be computed across ALL reasons, not just 22,23. This breaks correctness! Must keep two copies: one filtered for outer rows, one unfiltered for state averages.
  - Need to create two CTEs: one with reason filter (for outer rows), one without (for state averages).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Never split OR conditions into UNION ALL (0.21x on Q085): Query has no OR conditions, but avoid introducing UNION ALL.
2. Never restructure INNER JOIN orders (optimizer handles reordering): Comma joins in CTE need explicit JOIN syntax but don't force order.
3. Avoid CTEs for small dimension lookups (<10K rows): date_dim (365 rows) and item (small filtered set) are tiny; consider materializing.
4. Use AS MATERIALIZED when decorrelating: Prevents optimizer from inlining CTEs back into correlated form.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly 13 customer columns + ctr_total_return.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTE must output ctr_customer_sk, ctr_state, ctr_reason_sk, ctr_total_return for downstream joins and subquery.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All literal values (1999, 42-51, 193-222, 'CA','MI','SD','VA', 22-23, 1945-1951, 1.2) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by 13 customer columns.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: EXPLAIN shows SubPlan 2 executed 15 times (loops=15), scanning entire CTE each time.
- COMMA_JOIN_WEAKNESS: CTE uses comma-separated joins: `FROM web_returns, date_dim, customer_address, item`.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter_decorrelate: Push dimension filters into CTE definition. APPLY: Push ca_state and wr_reason_sk into CTE WHERE.
  - pushdown: Push predicates closer to table scans. APPLY: Move main query filters into CTE.
  - pg_dimension_prefetch_star: IGNORE: This strategy does not pre-filter dimensions into separate CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

### 2. pg_dimension_prefetch_star (3.32x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch (PG): pre-filter all selective dimensions into CTEs to create tiny hash tables, combined with explicit JOIN syntax. PostgreSQL's optimizer gets better cardinality estimates from pre-materialized small dimension results.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `runtime_config`: SET LOCAL commands for PostgreSQL. Omit or use empty array if not needed
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
