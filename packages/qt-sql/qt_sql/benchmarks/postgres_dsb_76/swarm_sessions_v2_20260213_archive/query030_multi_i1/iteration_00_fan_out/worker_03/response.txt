**Changes**: Created two CTEs: one filtered for reasons 22,23 (customer_total_return_filtered) and one unfiltered for state averages (customer_total_return_all_reasons). Added state_thresholds CTE to pre-compute per-state thresholds, decorrelating the subquery. Maintained all original filters and division guard.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x by eliminating correlated subquery execution and reducing CTE row counts through early filtering.
