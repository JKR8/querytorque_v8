    "Identified correlated scalar aggregate subquery in final_select that recomputes aggregation over STORE_RETURNS per store_sk.",
    "Shared scan approach aligns with Snowflake's strength in predicate pushdown and column pruning while avoiding re-scans.",

    "Decomposed into two downstream aggregates: one matching original grouping, one for per-store average used in decorrelated join."
