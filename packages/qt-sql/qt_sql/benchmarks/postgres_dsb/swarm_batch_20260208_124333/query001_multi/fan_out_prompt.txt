You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Query: query001_multi
## Dialect: postgres

```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sr_reason_sk as ctr_reason_sk
,sum(SR_REFUNDED_CASH) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
and sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity between 16 and 75
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk)
 select  c_customer_id

## Top 3 FAISS Examples (by structural similarity)

1. **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13xx) — 
2. **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93xx) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggregation ONCE in a CTE and deriving both 
3. **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32xx) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter dimension tables (date, item, promotion) 

## All Available Examples (full catalog — can swap if needed)

- **pg_date_cte_explicit_join** (2.28xx) — Isolate a selective date_dim filter into a CTE AND convert all comma-separated j
- **pg_dimension_prefetch_star** (3.32xx) — On multi-channel UNION queries with comma-separated implicit joins, pre-filter d
- **early_filter_decorrelate** (1.13xx) — 
- **pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter** (2.68xx) — Pre-filter ALL dimension tables AND the fact table into MATERIALIZED CTEs, then 
- **pg_self_join_decomposition** (3.93xx) — Eliminate duplicate fact table scans in self-join patterns by computing the aggr

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep FAISS recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from FAISS picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
