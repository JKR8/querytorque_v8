WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push down filters on date_dim and customer early, use explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter dimension tables to reduce the size of fact table joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, inline_decorrelate_materialized
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize dimension tables and fact table slices in CTEs, then join. Use CTEs to break down the query and avoid repeated scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_predicate_correlation_subquery_transform
EXAMPLES: DSB_PREDICATE_CORRELATION_STATS, FILTER_SUB_QUERY_TO_JOIN, SUBQUERY_OFFSET_ZERO_BARRIER
HINT: Create extended statistics on correlated predicates (c_birth_month and d_month_seq). Rewrite the INTERSECT as a JOIN between the three subqueries. Use OFFSET 0 to force materialization of subqueries for better plan control.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_intersect_to_window_aggregate
EXAMPLES: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_TO_WINDOW, AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN, EXISTS_INSTEAD_OF_COUNT
HINT: Transform the INTERSECT operation into a UNION ALL with a window function or aggregation to count distinct sales channels per tuple. Use EXISTS to check for presence in other channels and then count. Push the count below the set operation by restructuring.
