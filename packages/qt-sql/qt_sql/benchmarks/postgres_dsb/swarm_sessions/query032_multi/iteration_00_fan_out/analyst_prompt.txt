You are coordinating a swarm of 4 optimization specialists. Each specialist will attempt to optimize the same query using a DIFFERENT strategy and set of examples.

Your job: analyze the query structure, identify 4 diverse optimization angles, and assign each specialist a unique strategy with 3 relevant examples. Maximize diversity to cover the optimization space.

## Your Task

Design 4 DIFFERENT optimization strategies exploring diverse approaches. You may keep the matched recommendations OR swap examples from the catalog.

**Constraints**:
- Each worker gets exactly 3 examples
- No duplicate examples across workers (12 total, 3 per worker)
- If fewer than 12 unique examples are available, reuse is allowed

**Diversity guidelines**:
- Worker 1: Conservative — proven patterns, low risk (e.g., pushdown, early filter)
- Worker 2: Moderate — date/dimension isolation, CTE restructuring
- Worker 3: Aggressive — multi-CTE restructuring, prefetch patterns
- Worker 4: Novel — OR-to-UNION, structural transforms, intersect-to-exists

For each worker, specify:
1. **Strategy name** (e.g., `aggressive_date_prefetch`)
2. **3 examples** to use (from matched picks or catalog)
3. **Strategy hint** (1-2 sentences guiding the optimization approach)
