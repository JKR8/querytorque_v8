WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: safe_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Use early filtering and decorrelation of the subquery, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables to reduce join cost.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: cte_date_dimension_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date dimension into a CTE, pre-filter all dimensions and fact tables, and use explicit joins to improve join order control.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: multi_cte_materialize_decorrelate
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, inline_decorrelate_materialized
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables in CTEs, decompose self-join patterns to avoid duplicate scans, and decorrelate the subquery using materialization.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_decorrelate_union
EXAMPLES: inline_decorrelate_materialized, pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Transform the OR condition into UNION ALL, decorrelate the subquery by precomputing averages per item, and use early filtering to reduce data volume.
