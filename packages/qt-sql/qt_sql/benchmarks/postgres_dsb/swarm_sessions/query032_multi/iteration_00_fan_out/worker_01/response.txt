```

Changes: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing item-specific discount thresholds in a CTE, pre-filtered date_dim and item tables into separate CTEs, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: 1.8-2.5x due to early dimension filtering and eliminating per-row correlated subquery execution.
