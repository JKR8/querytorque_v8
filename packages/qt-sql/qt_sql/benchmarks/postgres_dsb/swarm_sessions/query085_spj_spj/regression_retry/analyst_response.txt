WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: FILTER_INTO_JOIN, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Apply safe predicate pushdown and convert implicit joins to explicit joins. Start by isolating the selective date_dim filter into a CTE to reduce fact table rows early in the plan.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables (date, demographics, address, reason) into materialized CTEs before joining with fact tables. Consider pushing MIN() aggregations below joins where possible to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_decomposition
EXAMPLES: inline_decorrelate_materialized, pg_self_join_decomposition, DSB_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION
HINT: Break the complex OR conditions into separate logical paths using CTE decomposition. Materialize intermediate results and eliminate redundant scans of the same fact tables (web_sales, web_returns) through strategic self-join decomposition.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_restructure
EXAMPLES: OR_TO_UNION_ALL, EXISTS_SUBPLAN_TO_SEMI_JOIN, NOT_IN_TO_NOT_EXISTS
HINT: Transform the problematic OR conditions into UNION ALL branches to enable separate optimization paths for each predicate combination. Explore semi-join transformations for any correlated subquery patterns that may emerge during restructuring.
