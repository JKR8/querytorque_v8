**Changes**: Isolated date filtering into a dedicated CTE, created pre-filtered CTEs for all dimension and fact tables before the main aggregation, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pushed month filters early into the date CTE.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x due to reduced intermediate result sizes and better join planning with explicit joins and pre-filtered dimension tables.
