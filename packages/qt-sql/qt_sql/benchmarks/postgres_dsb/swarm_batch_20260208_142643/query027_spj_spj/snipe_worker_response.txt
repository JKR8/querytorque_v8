**Changes**: Created separate CTEs for each dimension table with their filters pushed down, then joined them to the fact table. This allows PostgreSQL to materialize small filtered dimension sets before joining to the large fact table.

**Expected speedup**: ~2.5-3.5x by reducing the fact table join cardinality through early dimension filtering and enabling better join order optimization.
