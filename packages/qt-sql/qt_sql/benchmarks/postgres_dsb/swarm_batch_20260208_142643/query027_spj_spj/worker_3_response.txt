**Changes**: Converted comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and pre-filtered all four dimension tables into materialized CTEs before joining with the fact table. Each CTE includes only the necessary join key and output columns.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x by creating tiny hash tables from highly selective dimension filters (gender='M', marital='S', education='Advanced Degree', year=2002, state='VA', category='Jewelry'), allowing PostgreSQL to build optimal hash join plans with minimized intermediate result sizes.
