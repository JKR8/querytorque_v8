## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.53x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters early into CTEs, convert implicit joins to explicit joins, and pre-filter dimension tables to reduce join cardinality before set operations.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_last_name, c_first_name
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_year BETWEEN 1943 AND 1949
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (
    (
        SELECT DISTINCT
            cust.c_last_name,

### Worker 2: moderate_date_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.48x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date_dim filtering into a CTE, pre-fetch filtered dimension tables, and restructure with explicit joins to optimize the repeated date range scans across three sales channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
),

        d.d_date
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_date d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_customer c ON ss.ss_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
    WHERE ss.ss_list_price BETWEEN 217 AND 246
      AND ss.ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 44
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.58x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then restructure EXCEPT operations using precomputed sets to eliminate redundant scans and leverage temporary materialization.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11
),

### Worker 4: novel_set_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.52x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Transform EXCEPT operations using NOT EXISTS anti-joins or window deduplication, pre-compute base customer set once, and apply channel-specific conditions as correlated filters to avoid triple scanning.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
