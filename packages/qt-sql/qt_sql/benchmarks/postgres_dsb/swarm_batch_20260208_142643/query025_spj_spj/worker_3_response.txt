**Changes**: Created separate materialized CTEs for pre-filtered date dimensions and fact tables, then joined the reduced intermediate results with explicit JOIN syntax. This minimizes the initial row sets before the complex multi-way join.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x from reducing the large fact table scans early and providing better hash join planning with small pre-filtered CTEs.
