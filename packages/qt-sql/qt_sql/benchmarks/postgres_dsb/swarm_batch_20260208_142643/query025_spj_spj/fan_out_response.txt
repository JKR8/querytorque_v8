WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on explicit join syntax, predicate pushdown to date dimensions, and converting comma joins to explicit joins while preserving original logic.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_isolation_cte
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Pre-filter date_dim tables into CTEs using their selective date predicates before joining to fact tables, using explicit join syntax.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Create separate materialized CTEs for each pre-filtered fact and dimension table, then join CTEs to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_decomposition_intersect_exists
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Decompose the three-table join pattern using EXISTS/intersect logic or compute aggregates separately before final combination to avoid Cartesian explosion.
