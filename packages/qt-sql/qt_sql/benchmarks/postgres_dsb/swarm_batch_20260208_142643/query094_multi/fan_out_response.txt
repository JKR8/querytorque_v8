WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit joins, push down selective filters early, and decorrelate subqueries to reduce row counts before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs, then restructure joins to improve predicate pushdown and reduce intermediate result size.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact tables into CTEs, then restructure the self-join and anti-join using precomputed aggregates to minimize repeated scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_subquery_transform
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries using decorrelation techniques, decompose the self-join into a grouped CTE, and leverage explicit joins with isolated date filtering.
