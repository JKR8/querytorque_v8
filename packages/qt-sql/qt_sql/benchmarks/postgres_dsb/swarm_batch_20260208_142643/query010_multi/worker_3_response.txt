**Changes**: Materialized filtered date and item dimensions, created separate CTEs for each sales channel with distinct customer keys, then combined customers meeting the store sales requirement AND (web OR catalog) requirement before aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x from early dimension filtering and eliminating repeated joins across OR branches.
