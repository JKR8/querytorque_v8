WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_simplify
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Focus on pushing filters earlier in the query plan, converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and isolating selective date_dim filters into CTEs to reduce join cardinality early.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Restructure using CTEs to pre-filter all dimension tables (customer, address, date, item) and potentially fact tables, then join explicitly. This isolates filter-heavy operations.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_decompose
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize multiple pre-filtered CTEs (dimensions and fact subsets), then decompose the OR condition by evaluating store_sales and web_sales/catalog_sales paths separately before combining.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Transform the OR of two EXISTS subqueries into a UNION ALL of two main queries (one per channel), then aggregate the unioned results. Also explore converting implicit joins to explicit star-join patterns.
