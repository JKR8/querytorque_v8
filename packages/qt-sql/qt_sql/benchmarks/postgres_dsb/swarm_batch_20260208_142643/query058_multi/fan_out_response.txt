WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on pushing filters early into CTEs, eliminating correlated subqueries, and converting implicit joins to explicit joins for better planning.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate the date_dim subquery into a CTE, then materialize pre-filtered dimension tables (customer, item) before joining with fact tables.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Compute all sales channels in a single CTE using UNION ALL to avoid repeated scans, then aggregate once. Materialize filtered dimensions separately.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_intersect_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the final self-join with multiple BETWEEN conditions into an INTERSECT-based approach using HAVING clauses on a unified CTE.
