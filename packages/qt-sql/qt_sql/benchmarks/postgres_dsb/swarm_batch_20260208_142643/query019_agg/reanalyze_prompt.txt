You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Target: 2.0x speedup

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters early into CTEs and converting implicit joins to explicit joins for better plan control. Minimize restructuring while improving predicate selectivity.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
),
filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state = 'TX'
)
SELECT
    i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    i_brand AS brand,
    i_manufact_id,
    i_manufact,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filters into materialized CTEs before joining to the fact table. Restructure with explicit joins while keeping overall query shape similar.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
      AND d_moy = 12
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Home'
),
filtered_customer AS (
    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
),
filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state = 'TX'
),

    SELECT s_store_sk, s_zip
    FROM store
)
SELECT
    i.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    i.i_brand AS brand,
    i.i_manufact_id,
    i.i_manufact,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: pass (1.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimensions and fact subsets separately, then join. Consider restructuring as multiple CTEs with strategic materialization for plan stability.

```sql
select  i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
  from date_dim, store_sales, item,customer,customer_address,store
  where  d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
    and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
    and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    AND i_category  = 'Home'
    and d_year=2002
    and d_moy = 12
    and substring(ca_zip,1,5) <> substring(s_zip,1,5)
    and ca_state  = 'TX'
    and c_birth_month = 1

         ,i_manufact
limit 100 ;

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column fs.ss_sold_date_sk does not exist
LINE 45: JOIN filtered_date d ON fs.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
                                 ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure by separating filtering and aggregation phases. Experiment with CTE decomposition patterns that change the join order and aggregation timing.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
