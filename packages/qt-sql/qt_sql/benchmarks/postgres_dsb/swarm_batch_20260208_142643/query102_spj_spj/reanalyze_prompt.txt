You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
- **Status**: pass (1.16x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe filter pushdowns, convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pre-filter selective dimension tables to reduce early join cardinality.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filters into CTEs, use explicit joins, and consider materializing selective dimension subsets before joining with large fact tables.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column inv.inv_quantity_on_hand does not exist
LINE 65:       AND inv.inv_quantity_on_hand >= ss.ss_quantity
                   ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into CTEs, restructure the two fact-table pattern (store_sales/web_sales) as separate pre-aggregations, then combine.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002

- **Status**: pass (1.18x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the dual fact-table join pattern using conditional aggregation in a single scan, or restructure the date range join (d2 between d1 and d1+30) using a lateral join or window function.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
