Changes: Rewrote the query using subqueries to pre-filter selective dimensions (date_dim and item) before joining with the fact table, allowing early application of filters and reducing the intermediate result size. This follows the pg_dimension_prefetch_star pattern from the examples.

Expected speedup: ~3x by reducing the fact-dimension join cardinality early and enabling better optimizer join order choices.
