## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column reference "ss_item_sk" is ambiguous
LINE 92:   JOIN cross_items ci ON ss_item_sk = ci.ss_item_sk
                                  ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters early into CTEs, converting implicit joins to explicit JOINs with date dimension pre-filtering, and applying safe predicate pushdown without major restructuring.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2002

### Worker 2: moderate_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.78x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into materialized CTEs, restructure the main query to use explicit JOINs with pre-filtered CTEs, and decorrelate subqueries for better planning.

 (select i_item_sk ss_item_sk

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.64x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter ALL dimension tables and fact tables into separate materialized CTEs, then join. Decompose the self-join pattern in the final query to compute aggregations once.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,

### Worker 4: novel_intersect_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the INTERSECT operations to EXISTS or IN subqueries, restructure the cross_items CTE to reduce set operations, and apply structural transforms to the year comparison logic.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
