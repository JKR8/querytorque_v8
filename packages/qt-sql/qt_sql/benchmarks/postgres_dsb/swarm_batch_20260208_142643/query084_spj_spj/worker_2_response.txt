```sql

    WHERE ca_city = 'Lakeview'

filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 7 * 10000
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 7 * 10000 + 50000
)
SELECT
    MIN(c_customer_id),
    MIN(sr_ticket_number),
    MIN(sr_item_sk)
FROM customer
JOIN filtered_customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = filtered_customer_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
JOIN filtered_income_band ON hd_income_band_sk = filtered_income_band.ib_income_band_sk
JOIN store_returns ON sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
```

Changes: Isolated selective dimension filters (customer_address on city, income_band on bounds) into separate CTEs, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax to improve cardinality estimates and join planning.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x by creating tiny hash tables for filtered dimensions and enabling better join order optimization.
