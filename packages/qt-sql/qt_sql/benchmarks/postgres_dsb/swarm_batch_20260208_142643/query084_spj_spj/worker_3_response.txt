**Changes**: Materialized all dimension tables into separate CTEs with aggressive filtering, then joined the precomputed sets. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.5x due to reduced join cardinality from early filtering of large dimension tables and store_returns.
