You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
- **Status**: pass (1.22x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Convert implicit joins to explicit INNER JOINs for clarity and optimizer control, push selective filters (city, income_band) directly into the JOIN conditions, and ensure all dimension lookups happen after filtering.

```sql
select  c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  'Lakeview'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  69452
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  69452 + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 limit 100;
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.31x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate the most restrictive dimension filters (customer_address, income_band) into separate CTEs with explicit joins, then join the pre-filtered dimensions to the fact table (store_returns) and customer.

```sql
WITH filtered_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Lakeview'
),
filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 69452
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id AS customer_id,
  COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer
JOIN filtered_address ON c_current_addr_sk = filtered_address.ca_address_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
JOIN household_demographics ON hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
JOIN filtered_income_band ON filtered_income_band.ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
JOIN store_returns ON sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
- **Status**: pass (1.41x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension tables and the fact table into separate CTEs using aggressive pre-filtering, then perform a final join between the materialized results, potentially forcing join order.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_address AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Lakeview'
),
filtered_income_band AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 69452
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
),
joined_customers AS (
    SELECT
        c.c_customer_id,
        c.c_last_name,
        c.c_first_name,
        cd.cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer c
    JOIN filtered_customer_address ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
    JOIN customer_demographics cd ON cd.cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
    JOIN household_demographics hd ON hd.hd_demo_sk = c.c_current_hdemo_sk
    JOIN filtered_income_band ib ON ib.ib_income_band_sk = hd.hd_income_band_sk
)
SELECT
    jc.c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    COALESCE(jc.c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(jc.c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM joined_customers jc
JOIN store_returns sr ON sr.sr_cdemo_sk = jc.cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY jc.c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 4: novel_lateral_decompose
- **Status**: fail (1.64x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Decompose the star join using LATERAL subqueries to drive from the most selective dimension, transform implicit joins to EXISTS for customer lookups, and consider partitioned execution paths.

```sql
WITH filtered_ca AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_city = 'Lakeview'
),
filtered_ib AS (
    SELECT ib_income_band_sk
    FROM income_band
    WHERE ib_lower_bound >= 69452
      AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
),
customer_base AS (
    SELECT 
        c_customer_id,
        c_first_name,
        c_last_name,
        c_current_cdemo_sk,
        c_current_hdemo_sk
    FROM customer
    WHERE EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM filtered_ca
        WHERE filtered_ca.ca_address_sk = customer.c_current_addr_sk
    )
)
SELECT
    c.c_customer_id AS customer_id,
    COALESCE(c.c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c.c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer_base c
JOIN LATERAL (

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**:

    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address

    FROM household_demographics hd
    JOIN filtered_income_band fib ON hd.hd_income_band_sk = fib.ib_income_band_sk

        c_last_name,
        c_current_cdemo_sk,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
