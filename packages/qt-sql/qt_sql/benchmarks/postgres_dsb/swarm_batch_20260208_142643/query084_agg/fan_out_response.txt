WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit INNER JOINs for clarity and optimizer control, push selective filters (city, income_band) directly into the JOIN conditions, and ensure all dimension lookups happen after filtering.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate the most restrictive dimension filters (customer_address, income_band) into separate CTEs with explicit joins, then join the pre-filtered dimensions to the fact table (store_returns) and customer.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension tables and the fact table into separate CTEs using aggressive pre-filtering, then perform a final join between the materialized results, potentially forcing join order.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_lateral_decompose
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Decompose the star join using LATERAL subqueries to drive from the most selective dimension, transform implicit joins to EXISTS for customer lookups, and consider partitioned execution paths.
