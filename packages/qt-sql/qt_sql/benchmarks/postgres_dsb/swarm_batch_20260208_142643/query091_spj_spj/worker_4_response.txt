**Changes:** Transformed the OR condition on customer_demographics into a UNION ALL of two branches, created separate CTEs for highly selective dimension filters (date, household_demographics, customer_address), and used EXISTS semi-joins to pre-qualify customers before joining with the large fact tables. This reduces redundant scans and allows early filtering.

**Expected speedup:** ~2-3x due to elimination of the multi-way join explosion and early reduction of customer rows via EXISTS semi-joins.
