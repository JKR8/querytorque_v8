FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All attempts relied on CTE-based early filtering but failed due to PostgreSQL's CTE optimization fence behavior. Worker 1-2 and 5 showed marginal gains (1.04-1.08x) because CTEs prevent predicate pushdown and join reordering across CTE boundaries, forcing materialization of intermediate results. Worker 3-4 performed worse (0.45-0.58x) due to excessive materialization and EXISTS subqueries that created correlated execution patterns. The core issue: CTEs break the optimizer's ability to leverage selective joins (like date_dim → catalog_returns) and redistribute filters across the star schema.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Explicit JOIN ordering with selective fact-first approach**: Start with the most selective fact filter (date_dim → catalog_returns) using explicit JOIN syntax without CTEs.
2. **Partial materialization for low-selectivity dimensions**: Use subqueries in FROM clauses only for dimensions with high selectivity (date_dim, customer_demographics), while keeping others as regular joins.
3. **OR-to-UNION transformation within the main query**: Decompose the customer_demographics OR condition via UNION ALL in a derived table while maintaining join continuity.
4. **Index-aware predicate ordering**: Place most selective non-join predicates (d_year, d_moy) directly in JOIN conditions rather than WHERE.
5. **Elimination of redundant customer joins**: Pre-join customer with its three dimension tables (cd, hd, ca) in a single subquery to reduce intermediate cardinality.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
1. Start with a derived table joining catalog_returns to date_dim (most selective filter) using explicit INNER JOIN.
2. Immediately join to call_center (small dimension) to reduce row width early.
3. Create a pre-joined customer subquery that filters cd, hd, and ca in a single scan using EXISTS for correlated conditions, but materialize only once.
4. Transform the OR condition in customer_demographics using UNION ALL in a lateral subquery.
5. Use explicit JOIN ordering from most selective to least, avoiding CTEs entirely.

EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Rewrite without CTEs using explicit JOIN order: date_dim → catalog_returns → call_center → (pre-joined customer with cd/hd/ca via EXISTS). Transform the cd OR condition via UNION ALL in a lateral derived table. Ensure all filters are pushed into JOIN conditions.
