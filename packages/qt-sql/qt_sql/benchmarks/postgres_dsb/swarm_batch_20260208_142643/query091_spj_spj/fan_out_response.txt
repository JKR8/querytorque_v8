WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push selective filters (date, demographics, address) down into the joins early, and consider converting implicit joins to explicit joins for better predicate pushdown control.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate highly selective dimension filters (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address) into CTEs or subqueries to reduce join cardinality early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize filtered subsets of all dimension tables and the fact table into separate CTEs, then join them in a star-optimized order to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the OR condition in customer_demographics into a UNION, decompose joins to use EXISTS for selective dimensions, and restructure the query to avoid redundant scans.
