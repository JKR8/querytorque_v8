**Changes**: Isolated date and address filters into separate CTEs, pre-computed state averages to eliminate correlated subquery, converted to explicit JOIN syntax for better join planning, and maintained all original columns and ordering.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x from eliminating correlated subquery overhead, early filtering of dimensions, and improved join order optimization.
