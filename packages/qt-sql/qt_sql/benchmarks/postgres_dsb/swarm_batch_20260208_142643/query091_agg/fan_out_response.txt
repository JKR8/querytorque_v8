WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push selective filters (date, demographics, location) as early as possible into joins using explicit join syntax, reduce intermediate row counts through predicate pushdown before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate highly selective dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics) into CTEs with pre-applied filters before joining to the fact table, using explicit JOINs for clarity.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension subsets and pre-filtered fact rows into separate CTEs, then perform joins on reduced datasets to minimize hash table sizes and memory pressure.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_restructuring
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the OR condition on demographics into a UNION ALL of two separate subqueries, potentially enabling better filter pushdown and index usage for each demographic pattern.
