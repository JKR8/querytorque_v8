Changes: Decomposed the OR condition on customer demographics into a UNION ALL of two separate branches, each with its own demographic filter. Created separate CTEs for filtered dimension tables to push filters early. This enables better filter pushdown and potentially different join plans for each demographic pattern.

Expected speedup: 1.5-2x due to elimination of OR condition ambiguity, enabling more efficient index usage and join ordering for each demographic pattern separately.
