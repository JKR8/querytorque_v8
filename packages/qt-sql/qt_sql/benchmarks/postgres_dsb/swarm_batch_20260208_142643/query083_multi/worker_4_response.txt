**Changes**: 
1. Created separate CTEs for date filtering and item filtering to avoid repeated subqueries
2. Combined the three return channels into a single UNION ALL query
3. Used conditional aggregation (FILTER clauses) to compute per-channel sums in a single pass
4. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimization

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x due to reduced repeated scans, elimination of triangular join, and better use of PostgreSQL's aggregation capabilities.
