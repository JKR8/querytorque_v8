**Changes**: Created `filtered_dates` and `filtered_items` CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables, decorrelated the date subqueries, and converted all implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This allows PostgreSQL to push filters earlier and get better selectivity estimates.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x through early filter pushdown and reduced repeated subquery evaluation.
