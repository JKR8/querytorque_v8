FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
Worker 1 (0.62x) pushed filters but maintained three separate CTEs with repeated filtering logic, missing opportunities for data reduction before joins. Worker 2 (1.01x) achieved minimal speedup by pre-filtering dimensions but still scanned three fact tables separately with identical dimension filters. Worker 3 (0.06x) catastrophically fused CTEs via LEFT JOINs, creating Cartesian explosion between large fact tables. Worker 4 (0.06x) used UNION ALL but aggregated prematurely before final grouping, losing per-channel aggregation efficiency. Worker 5 (0.31x) essentially duplicated Worker 2 with minor variations. All attempts failed because: (1) they kept three separate fact table scans with repetitive dimension filtering, (2) they missed converting ratio filters (amt/quantity BETWEEN) to multiplication to avoid expensive divisions, (3) they didn't exploit materialization of the highly selective date_dim filter, (4) they didn't pre-aggregate fact tables before joining with dimensions, and (5) they didn't consider partitioning the work via derived tables with window functions.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. Replace division filters with multiplication (amt BETWEEN 184*quantity AND 213*quantity) to enable index usage.
2. Materialize the tiny date_dim result (only 4 months) and broadcast it to all three channels.
3. Pre-aggregate each fact table on (item_sk, returned_date_sk) before joining with dimensions.
4. Use a single derived table to compute all three aggregations via conditional window functions after UNION ALL.
5. Leverage predicate pushdown into subqueries with EXISTS instead of IN for date filtering.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Create a materialized CTE for the 4 target months from date_dim, then pre-aggregate each returns table separately on its natural keys filtered by the materialized dates and ratio (via multiplication). Join these pre-aggregated results with item dimension in a final consolidation step using FULL OUTER JOIN to preserve all items, then compute percentages. This reduces fact table scans, minimizes division operations, and allows parallelizable aggregation paths.

EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize the date filter, convert division to multiplication, pre-aggregate each returns table before dimension joins, and use a single consolidation step with COALESCE for missing channels.
