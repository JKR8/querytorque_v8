WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_restructure
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Apply basic performance techniques: push filters early, convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs, and isolate selective date_dim filtering into a CTE for reuse across all sales channels.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimensional_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Focus on dimensional pre-filtering by creating CTEs for date_dim and customer with applied filters before joining to fact tables, using explicit joins for better cardinality estimation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialized_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact data into separate CTEs for each sales channel, then perform set operations, aiming to reduce repeated table scans and leverage materialization benefits.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_intersect_to_exists_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Transform INTERSECT operations to EXISTS semi-joins or window-based deduplication, potentially using a single pass over customer/date dimensions with conditional fact table aggregations.
