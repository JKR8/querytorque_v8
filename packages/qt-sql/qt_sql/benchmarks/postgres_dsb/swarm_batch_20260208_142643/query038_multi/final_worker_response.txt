**Changes**: Transformed the three-way INTERSECT into a single unified aggregation. Created filtered CTEs for date_dim and customer to apply selective filters early, then combined all qualifying sales records via UNION ALL with channel identifiers. Replaced INTERSECT logic with BIT_OR aggregation checking for presence in all three channels.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x. Eliminates redundant scans of fact tables and allows PostgreSQL to leverage indexes directly on the fact tables. The single-pass aggregation with early dimension filtering should reduce I/O and computation overhead significantly.
