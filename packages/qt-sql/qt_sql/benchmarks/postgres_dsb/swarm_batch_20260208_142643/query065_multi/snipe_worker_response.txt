Changes: Applied shared materialization pattern by creating a single CTE for the expensive store_sales+date_dim join, then deriving both aggregates (per-store average and per-store-per-item revenue) from it. Added early dimension prefetch CTEs for store and item with their filters pushed down.

Expected speedup: 3.0x+ by eliminating duplicate fact table scans and reducing join sizes early.
