**Changes**: 
1. Decorrelated the date range subqueries into a single CTE (`filtered_date`) using CROSS JOIN for interval join
2. Pre-filtered `store_sales` on `ss_wholesale_cost` early to reduce join size
3. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control
4. Preserved the UNION pattern for state conditions (already efficient)

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x from decorrelation and early filtering
