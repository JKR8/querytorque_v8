Changes: Eliminated the correlated subquery by computing state thresholds using a window function in the main CTE, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and reordered filters to apply all selective predicates before the customer join.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by removing per-row correlated subquery execution and enabling single-pass aggregation with early filtering.
