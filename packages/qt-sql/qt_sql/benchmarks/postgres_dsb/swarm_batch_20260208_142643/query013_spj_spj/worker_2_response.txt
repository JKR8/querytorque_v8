**Changes:** Isolated date_dim filter and combined customer_demographics/household_demographics into a single CTE with pre-applied marital/education/dep_count filters, created a filtered customer_address CTE, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax with CTEs for better predicate pushdown.

**Expected speedup:** 1.8-2.2x due to reduced intermediate row counts and better hash join planning with pre-filtered dimension tables.
