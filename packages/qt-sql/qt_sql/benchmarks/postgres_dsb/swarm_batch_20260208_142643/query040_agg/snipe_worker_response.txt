**Changes**: Created three CTEs: `filtered_date` (61-day date range), `filtered_item` (Home category with manager filter), and `filtered_sales` (pre-joins sales with filtered dimensions and applies wholesale cost filter). This reduces the fact table early and creates small dimension hash tables. Also converted comma joins to explicit JOIN syntax and moved the `cr_reason_sk` filter into the LEFT JOIN condition.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0–2.5x due to early reduction of catalog_sales via filtered dimensions and creation of small hash tables for dimensions before the main aggregation.
