Changes: Created three prefetch CTEs for highly selective dimensions (date_dim, item) and the fact table (catalog_sales), then joined them explicitly with filtered conditions. This reduces intermediate data volume and improves hash join planning.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from reduced data movement and better PostgreSQL optimizer estimates.
