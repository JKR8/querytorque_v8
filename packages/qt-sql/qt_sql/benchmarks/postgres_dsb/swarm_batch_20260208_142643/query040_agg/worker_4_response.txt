**Changes**: Decomposed the outer join by creating separate CTEs for filtered dimensions and catalog sales, moved `cr_reason_sk=16` filter to WHERE clause with NULL-handling to preserve LEFT JOIN semantics, enabling early filtering and better join optimization.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x through reduced intermediate result sizes and enabling more efficient join order selection.
