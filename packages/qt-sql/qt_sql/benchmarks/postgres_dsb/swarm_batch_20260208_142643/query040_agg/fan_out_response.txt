WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push filters on date, item, and catalog_sales early, and use explicit joins to control join order and reduce row counts.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_prefetch_cte
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, item) and fact table (catalog_sales) into CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN syntax to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in CTEs, and restructure the query to avoid duplicate scans of the fact table.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform_decomposition
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Apply structural transformations such as decomposing the outer join and using early filter decorrelation to enable novel access paths and reduce computation.
