**Changes**:
1. Converted `LEFT JOIN` to `INNER JOIN` since `cr_reason_sk = 16` is mandatory
2. Created filtered dimension CTEs for date, item, and warehouse to apply filters early
3. Pre-aggregated fact data in a CTE joining catalog_sales with catalog_returns and filtered dates
4. Used explicit `INNER JOIN` syntax for better optimizer control
5. Maintained all original filters and calculations exactly

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x due to early filtering, dimension isolation, and converting left join to inner join. The rewrite enables partition pruning on date_dim and reduces intermediate result sizes before the expensive join operations.
