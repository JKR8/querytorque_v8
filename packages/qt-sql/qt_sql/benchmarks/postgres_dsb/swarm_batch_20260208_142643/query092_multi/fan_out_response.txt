WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_join_convert
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Focus on filter pushdown and converting comma joins to explicit JOINs for better predicate control, while keeping structure simple.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_correlated_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into CTEs, then join with main fact table and attempt to decorrelate the subquery via CTE materialization.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure the self-join subquery to compute aggregates once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_union_subquery_flatten
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Transform the OR condition on item into UNION branches, flatten the correlated subquery via lateral join, and decompose the self-join pattern.
