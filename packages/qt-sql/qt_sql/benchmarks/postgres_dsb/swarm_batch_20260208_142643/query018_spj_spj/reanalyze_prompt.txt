You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters early into explicit JOINs, isolate selective date dimension, and convert implicit joins to explicit CTEs for better predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_dep_count
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs before joining, using explicit JOIN syntax and materializing filtered dimension sets.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk, cd_dep_count
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'

    SELECT c_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk, c_birth_year
    FROM customer
    WHERE c_birth_month = 1
),

    FROM customer_address
    WHERE ca_state IN ('GA', 'LA', 'SD')
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefilter_materialize
- **Status**: pass (0.78x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into CTEs, then join, potentially decomposing for early aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category = 'Jewelry'
),

### Worker 4: novel_subquery_transform_union
- **Status**: pass (0.80x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Transform IN-list to UNION/EXISTS, decompose MIN aggregates via subqueries, and use decorrelation with materialized CTEs for radical restructuring.

```sql
WITH 
-- Pre-filter dimension tables to reduce join sizes early
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year = 1998
),

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
