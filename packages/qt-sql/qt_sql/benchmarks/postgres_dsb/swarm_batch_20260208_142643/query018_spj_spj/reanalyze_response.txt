FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All workers fell short primarily due to over-reliance on CTEs with PostgreSQL's optimization fence behavior. While CTEs can structure queries, they prevent predicate pushdown, join reordering, and materialization optimizations across the query. The attempts transformed a 6-table join into a series of independent CTE scans that PostgreSQL cannot reorder effectively. Additionally:
1. Worker 3 (0.78x) aggressively materialized all CTEs, forcing full sequential scans of filtered subsets before any joins.
2. Worker 4's UNION approach for IN-list added unnecessary complexity without selectivity gain.
3. All attempts missed the core bottleneck: large catalog_sales scan with late application of selective dimension filters.
4. The original implicit join allows PostgreSQL's optimizer to choose optimal join order based on statistics; CTEs disrupt this.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Lateral joins for early fact reduction**: Use LATERAL to push dimension filters directly into fact table access.
2. **Partial aggregation before final join**: Compute MIN per table where possible, then combine.
3. **Explicit join order forcing with selective filters first**: Manually order joins from most selective to least, bypassing optimizer misestimates.
4. **Index-only scan optimization**: Structure query to enable index-only scans on filtered columns.
5. **Conditional aggregation transformation**: Transform multiple MIN() into single-pass conditional MIN(CASE...).
6. **Batched key join**: Use WHERE EXISTS for dimension keys before joining all columns.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Combine selective dimension pre-filtering via EXISTS subqueries with explicit join ordering that forces most restrictive filters first. Use derived tables instead of CTEs to allow optimizer freedom, and apply LATERAL for correlated filtering on catalog_sales. Structure to enable index usage on cs_sold_date_sk and cs_wholesale_cost simultaneously.

EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Transform dimension filters into EXISTS correlated subqueries applied directly to catalog_sales scan. Use explicit JOIN ordering: date_dim → item → customer_demographics → customer → customer_address. Compute partial minimums in subqueries where possible, then combine via outer query. Avoid CTEs entirely; use derived tables in FROM clause.
