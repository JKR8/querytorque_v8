WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push down selective filters (date, category, marital status) early into CTEs and convert implicit joins to explicit JOINs for clarity and better plan choices.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate dimension tables (date, customer, customer_demographics) into filtered CTEs, then join with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax to reduce intermediate rows.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into separate CTEs, then restructure the self-join to compute aggregated pairs from a single store_sales scan.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Decompose the self-join by pre-aggregating store_sales, then join to items; use EXISTS for customer/dimension correlations and materialize intermediate results.
