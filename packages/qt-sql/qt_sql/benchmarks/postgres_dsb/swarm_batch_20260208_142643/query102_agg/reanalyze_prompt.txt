You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: operator does not exist: integer = character
LINE 29: JOIN store ON inv_warehouse_sk = s_state
                                        ^
HINT:  No operator matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters down early, convert implicit comma joins to explicit ANSI JOINs, and pre-filter selective dimension tables (date_dim, item, customer_address) before joining.

```sql
WITH filtered_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
      AND i_manager_id IN (1, 2, 4, 11, 12, 14, 21, 29, 32, 52)

    SELECT ca_address_sk
    FROM customer_address

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.36x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date_dim filters into CTEs, then pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables using explicit JOIN syntax.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')

- **Status**: pass (1.58x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize all filtered dimension and fact subsets into CTEs, then restructure the self-join on date_dim by computing date ranges in a single pass before final aggregation.

select 
    cd_gender,
    cd_marital_status,

- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure the query by replacing IN lists with UNION ALL subqueries, transform the date self-join into an EXISTS correlated subquery, and decorrelate any dependent joins.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
