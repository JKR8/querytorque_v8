### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter_optimization
- **Status**: fail (0.22x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Apply conservative optimizations by pushing filters earlier, converting implicit joins to explicit joins, and pre-filtering dimension tables to reduce join sizes while maintaining the original query structure.

- **Status**: fail (0.24x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, early_filter_decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective dimension filters (date, item) into materialized CTEs, then restructure the main UNION query with explicit joins to improve join ordering and reduce intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim

- **Status**: fail (0.28x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Use aggressive prefetching by creating multiple materialized CTEs for filtered dimension and fact data, then restructure the self-join pattern to compute aggregates once instead of scanning large fact tables multiple times.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT
        i_item_sk,

- **Error**: column "d_year" does not exist
LINE 18:         d_year,
                 ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply novel structural transformations such as decomposing the self-join into a single aggregation CTE with year grouping, then deriving prev/curr years via conditional aggregation or window functions to eliminate redundant scans and optimize ratio calculations.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
