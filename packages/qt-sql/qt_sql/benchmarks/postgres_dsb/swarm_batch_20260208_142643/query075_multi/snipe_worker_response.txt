**Changes**: Applied dimension prefetching by creating separate CTEs for filtered `item` and `date_dim` tables, pushing down year filtering and category filtering early. This reduces the data volume before expensive joins and enables better join planning. Also converted implicit cross join to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and optimizer benefits.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.0x due to reduced data volume in fact table joins and better use of indexes on filtered dimension tables.
