WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown_explicit_join
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better join order control, push all dimension filters directly into JOIN conditions, and eliminate any unnecessary complexity while maintaining the original logic.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation_cte
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, early_filter_decorrelate
HINT: Isolate selective dimension filters (date_dim, customer_demographics, item, store) into separate CTEs before joining to the fact table, using explicit JOINs to enforce optimal join order.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_materialized_prefilter_star
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension tables AND the filtered fact table into separate CTEs (with MATERIALIZED hint if needed), then perform the final star-join and aggregation on these reduced datasets.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_rollup_decomposition_union
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Decompose the ROLLUP into separate aggregation levels using UNION ALL—compute base aggregates once in a CTE, then derive different grouping levels from it, potentially avoiding repeated fact table scans.
