**Changes**: 
1. Created separate CTEs for filtered date range and filtered items to reduce early join sizes
2. Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing per-item average discount thresholds in a separate CTE
3. Used explicit JOIN syntax with LEFT JOIN to handle items without matching threshold calculations
4. Applied COALESCE to maintain original semantics when no threshold exists (treats as 0)

**Expected speedup**: 2.0-3.0x by eliminating correlated subquery execution and reducing initial join cardinality through dimension prefetching.
