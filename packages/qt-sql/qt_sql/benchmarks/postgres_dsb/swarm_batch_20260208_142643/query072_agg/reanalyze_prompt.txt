### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.04x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters early into CTEs, pre-filtering dimension tables, and reducing join cardinality before aggregation.

    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
    FROM date_dim

- **Status**: pass (1.18x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date and dimension filters into explicit CTEs, then join with the fact table to minimize intermediate data movement.

WITH filtered_date_d1 AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_week_seq, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.18x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and materialize ALL dimension and fact tables in separate CTEs, then restructure joins to eliminate duplicate scans and leverage prefetching.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date, d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 1998

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column reference "d_week_seq" is ambiguous
LINE 69:     d_week_seq,
             ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Break complex join patterns via decomposition (fact table self-joins), decorrelate filters, and use materialized pre-filtering for radical plan changes.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
