**Changes**: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax and created separate CTEs for each dimension table with their selective filters applied early, reducing the join size before the main fact table processing.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x based on similar patterns showing PostgreSQL benefits from pre-filtered dimension CTEs and explicit join syntax.
