## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W2 achieved 1.91x via moderate_dimension_isolation. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query072_spj_spj_snipe

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Apply the same query072 joins and filter slice and return minimum representative keys for SPJ validation.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~326k rows
**Outputs**: [MIN(i_item_sk), MIN(w_warehouse_name), MIN(d1.d_week_seq), MIN(cs_item_sk), MIN(cs_order_number), MIN(inv_item_sk)]
**Dependencies**: catalog_sales, inventory (join), warehouse (join), item (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), promotion (join), catalog_returns (join)
**Joins**: d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
**Filters**: inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity | d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL '3 DAY' | hd_buy_potential = '501-1000' | d1.d_year = 1998 | cd_marital_status = 'M' | cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11 | i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music') | cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_sales], SEQ_SCAN[household_demographics], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(i_item_sk),
  MIN(w_warehouse_name),
  MIN(d1.d_week_seq),
  MIN(cs_item_sk),
  MIN(cs_order_number),
  MIN(inv_item_sk)
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN inventory
  ON (
    cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk
  )
JOIN warehouse
  ON (
    w_warehouse_sk = inv_warehouse_sk
  )
JOIN item
  ON (
    i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
  )
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**Principle:** Staged Reduction for Non-Equi Joins: when queries have expensive non-equi joins, reduce BOTH dimension and fact table sizes via MATERIALIZED CTEs before the join. Combined selectivity dramatically cuts the search space for inequality predicates.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  i_item_desc
      ,w_warehouse_name
      ,d1.d_week_seq
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) no_promo
      ,sum(case when p_promo_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) promo
      ,count(*) total_cnt
from catalog_sales
join inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)
join warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)
join item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
join customer_demographics on (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)
join household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)
join date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)
left outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)
left outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
where d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day'
  and hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
  and d1.d_year = 1998
  and cd_marital_status = 'M'
  and cd_dep_count between 9 and 11
  and i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
group by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq
order by total_cnt desc, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
limit 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_date]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_date, d_week_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 1998
```
[filtered_item]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc FROM item WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
```
[filtered_cd]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11
```
[filtered_hd]:
```sql
SELECT hd_demo_sk FROM household_demographics WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
```
[cs_filtered]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_bill_cdemo_sk, cs_bill_hdemo_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_ship_date_sk, cs_promo_sk, cs_quantity, cs_wholesale_cost, cs_order_number FROM catalog_sales WHERE cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq, SUM(CASE WHEN p.p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo, SUM(CASE WHEN p.p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo, COUNT(*) AS total_cnt FROM cs_filtered cs JOIN inventory inv ON cs.cs_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk JOIN warehouse w ON w.w_warehouse_sk = inv.inv_warehouse_sk JOIN filtered_item i ON i.i_item_sk = cs.cs_item_sk JOIN filtered_cd cd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_hd hd ON cs.cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_date d1 ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk JOIN date_dim d2 ON inv.inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk JOIN date_dim d3 ON cs.cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk LEFT OUTER JOIN promotion p ON cs.cs_promo_sk = p.p_promo_sk LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns cr ON cr.cr_item_sk = cs.cs_item_sk AND cr.cr_order_number = cs.cs_order_number WHERE d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND inv.inv_quantity_on_hand < cs.cs_quantity AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL '3 day' GROUP BY i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq ORDER BY total_cnt DESC, i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**

Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `MIN(i_item_sk)`
  2. `MIN(w_warehouse_name)`
  3. `MIN(d1.d_week_seq)`
  4. `MIN(cs_item_sk)`
  5. `MIN(cs_order_number)`
  6. `MIN(inv_item_sk)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
