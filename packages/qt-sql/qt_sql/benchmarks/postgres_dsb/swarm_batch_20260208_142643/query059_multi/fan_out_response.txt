WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Push selective filters (date range, state list) as early as possible into the query flow, and convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and better join order control by the planner.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate the selective date_dim and store filters into dedicated CTEs, then join them with the fact aggregation. Use explicit JOINs and consider materializing the pre-filtered CTEs.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_self_join_decomposition, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Pre-filter and materialize both dimension and fact data into separate CTEs. Restructure the self-join to compute the base aggregation only once, then derive the two time periods from that single result.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_self_join_elimination
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Eliminate the costly self-join by computing the weekly aggregates once and using window functions or conditional aggregation to create both time period columns (current year and prior year) in a single scan.
