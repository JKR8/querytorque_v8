This forced nested loop joins and full fact table scans despite highly selective dimension filters (0.15% selectivity on store, ~1% on date_dim). The 0.65x-1.05x range indicates CTE overhead outweighed filtering benefits. Worker 4's 1.05x showed marginal gain from explicit column references but couldn't",
