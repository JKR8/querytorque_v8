  "why_it_failed": "The primary failure mechanism was a column resolution error (\"column 'ca_state' does not exist\") that occurred in 3/5 attempts. This happened because workers created CTEs for filtered dimension tables (like customer_address) but only selected a subset of columns (e.g., just `ca_address_sk`), then referenced additional columns (like `ca_state`) from these CTEs in the main query's WHERE clause. Attempts 1, 2, and 5 all made this same structural mistake by referencing columns from CTEs that weren't",
