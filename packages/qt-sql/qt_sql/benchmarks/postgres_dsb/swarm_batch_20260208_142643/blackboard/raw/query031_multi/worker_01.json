  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short because they only addressed dimension table filtering and join syntax, missing the core performance bottleneck: the original query's multi-way self-join pattern (six instances of CTEs) forces repeated scans of aggregated data. While pre-filtering dimensions helped modestly (0.61x-0.74x), the fundamental computational complexity remains. The self-joins create exponential growth in intermediate rows, and the final Cartesian-style joins between ss and ws CTEs multiply the pr",
