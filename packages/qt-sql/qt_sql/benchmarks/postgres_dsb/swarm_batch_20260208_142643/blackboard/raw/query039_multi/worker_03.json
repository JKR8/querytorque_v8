  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch: ** Applied aggressive_prefetch_selfjoin strategy by materializing filtered dimension tables into CTEs, then computing base inventory aggregation once and deriving both sides of the self-join from the same result. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x due to reduced dimension table scans, single aggregation computation, and better join cardinality estimates from pre-filtered CTEs.",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering multiple dimension tables in parallel reduces join fan-out",
