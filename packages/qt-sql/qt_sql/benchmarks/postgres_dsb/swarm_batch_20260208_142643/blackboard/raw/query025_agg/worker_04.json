This reduces intermediate row counts and eliminates redundant joins to the date_dim table.",
  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short due to fundamental misconceptions about PostgreSQL's optimizer behavior with CTEs. Worker 1 (1.00x) showed CTEs provided no benefit because PostgreSQL's optimizer can already push filters into implicit joins. Workers 2-5 (0.68x, 0.81x, 0.47x, 0.69x) performed worse because their CTEs were being materialized by default (PostgreSQL's behavior), creating temporary tables that eliminated index usage and increased I/O. Worker 4's 0.47x was disastrous because it forced material",
