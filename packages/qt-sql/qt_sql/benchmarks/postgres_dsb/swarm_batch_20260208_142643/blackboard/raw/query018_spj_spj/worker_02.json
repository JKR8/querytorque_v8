While CTEs can structure queries, they prevent predicate pushdown, join reordering, and materialization optimizations across the query. The attempts transformed a 6-table join into a series of independent CTE scans that PostgreSQL cannot reorder effectively. Additionally:\n1. Worker 3 (0.78x) aggressively materialized all CTEs, forcing full sequential scans of filtered subsets before any j",
