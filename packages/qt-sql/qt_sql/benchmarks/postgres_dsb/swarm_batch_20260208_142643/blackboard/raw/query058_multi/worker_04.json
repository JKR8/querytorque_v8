Added dimension pre-filtering CTEs for date, item, and customer to reduce join sizes early. The `HAVING COUNT(*) = 3` clause ensures all three channels have data for each (item_id, birth_year) pair, making the self-join implicit rather than explicit.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x due to: 1) eliminating the 3-way self-join ",
