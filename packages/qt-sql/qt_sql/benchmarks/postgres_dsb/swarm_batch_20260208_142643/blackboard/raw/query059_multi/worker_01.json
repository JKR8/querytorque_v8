  "what_worked": "Applied pushdown: ** Created separate CTEs for filtered stores and two date ranges, then computed the two periods' aggregations independently with explicit JOINs and early filter pushdown. This enables PostgreSQL to use hash joins with small dimension tables and process less data overall.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 1.8-2.5x due to reduced intermediate result sizes and better join order control.",
