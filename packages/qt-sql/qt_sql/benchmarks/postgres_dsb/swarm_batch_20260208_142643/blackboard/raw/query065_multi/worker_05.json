  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch: Applied shared materialization pattern by creating a single CTE for the expensive store_sales+date_dim join, then deriving both aggregates (per-store average and per-store-per-item revenue) from it. Added early dimension prefetch CTEs for store and item with their filters pushed down.",
  "why_it_worked": "Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; converting to JOIN eliminates per-row overhead; Pre-filtering date dimension into CTE reduces hash join probe table from 73K to ~365 rows; Pre-filtering multiple dimension tables in parallel reduces join fan-out",
