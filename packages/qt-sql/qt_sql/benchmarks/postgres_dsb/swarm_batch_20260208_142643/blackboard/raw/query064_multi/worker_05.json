  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short due to two primary mechanisms: 1) Syntax errors from incorrect column referencing when restructuring implicit joins to explicit JOINs (Workers 2,3,4), and 2) Insufficient optimization impact when only pushing filters into CTEs without addressing the core bottleneck - the massive self-join of the cross_sales CTE with 17-column grouping (Workers 1,5). The successful attempts (0.57x, 0.53x) actually degraded performance because they added materialization overhead without eli",
