Worker 2 (1.01x) achieved minimal speedup by pre-filtering dimensions but still scanned three fact tables separately with identical dimension filters. Worker 3 (0.06x) catastrophically fused CTEs via LEFT JOINs, creating Cartesian explosion between large fact tables. Worker 4 (0.06x) used UNION ALL but aggregated prematurely before final groupin",
