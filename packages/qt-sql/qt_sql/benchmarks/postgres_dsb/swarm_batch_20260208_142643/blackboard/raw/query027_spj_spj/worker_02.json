This allows PostgreSQL to build small hash tables from highly filtered dimensions before joining with the large fact table.",
  "why_it_failed": "All attempts used CTE-based dimension pre-filtering but failed because PostgreSQL's CTEs act as optimization fences, preventing join order optimization and predicate pushdown into the fact table. This forced nested loop joins and full fact table scans despite highly selective dimension filters (0.15% selectivity on store, ~1% on date_dim). The 0.65x-1.05x range indicates CTE overhead outweighed filtering benefits. Worker 4's 1.05x showed marginal gain from explicit column references but couldn't",
