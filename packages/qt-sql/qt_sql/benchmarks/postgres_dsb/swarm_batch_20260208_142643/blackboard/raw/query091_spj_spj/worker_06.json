Worker 1-2 and 5 showed marginal gains (1.04-1.08x) because CTEs prevent predicate pushdown and join reordering across CTE boundaries, forcing materialization of intermediate results. Worker 3-4 performed worse (0.45-0.58x) due to excessive materialization and EXISTS subqueries that created correlated execution patterns. The core issue: CTEs break the optimizer's ability to leverage s",
