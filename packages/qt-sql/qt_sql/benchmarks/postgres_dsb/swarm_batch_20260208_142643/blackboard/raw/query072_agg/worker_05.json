The core bottleneck remains untouched: the massive join between catalog_sales and inventory with a non\u2011equi condition (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity), which generates a huge intermediate result before filtering. Additionally, the self\u2011join pattern on date_dim (d1, d2, d3) was not optimized; each attempt joined them independently, missing opportunities",
