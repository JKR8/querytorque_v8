  "why_it_failed": "All workers fell short because they focused on dimension pre-filtering without addressing the fundamental bottleneck: the many-to-many join explosion between catalog_sales and inventory. The WHERE condition `inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity` creates a non-equijoin that's inherently expensive, and all attempts preserved this join pattern. Worker 2's 1.91x came closest by pre-joining date_dim tables (d1-d2) but still missed the opportunity to reduce the cardinality before this expensive join. Th",
