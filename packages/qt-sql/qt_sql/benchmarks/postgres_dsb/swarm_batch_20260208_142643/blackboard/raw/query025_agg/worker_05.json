This creates tiny hash tables for date lookups and gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x based on similar patterns in reference examples (pg_dimension_prefetch_star achieved 3.32x, pg_date_cte_explicit_join achieved 2.28x).",
  "why_it_failed": "All attempts fell short due to fundamental misconceptions about PostgreSQL's optimizer behavior with CTEs. Worker 1 (1.00x) showed CTEs provided no benefit because PostgreSQL's optimizer can already push filters into implicit joins. Workers 2-5 (0.68x, 0.81x, 0.47x, 0.69x) performed worse because their CTEs were being materialized by default (PostgreSQL's behavior), creating temporary tables that eliminated index usage and increased I/O. Worker 4's 0.47x was disastrous because it forced material",
