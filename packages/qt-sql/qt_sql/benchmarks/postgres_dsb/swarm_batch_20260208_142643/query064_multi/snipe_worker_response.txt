Changes: Applied pg_dimension_prefetch_star pattern by creating filtered CTEs for selective dimension tables (date_dim for 1998-1999, item, promotion, customer_address, customer_demographics), converted all implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, and pushed year filter into filtered_date CTE to reduce cross_sales aggregation size.

Expected speedup: 2.5x-3.5x due to early filtering of large dimension tables and better join planning with explicit JOINs.
