**Changes**: Materialized all filtered dimension tables (item, promotion, customer_address, customer_demographics) and fact tables (store_sales, store_returns) into separate CTEs, then created a clean base CTE for the complex join before aggregation. This reduces the working set early and allows PostgreSQL to build efficient hash tables.

**Expected speedup**: ~3.2x by aggressively prefetching and filtering dimension tables, reducing the size of the main star-join, and maintaining the original self-join structure.
