**Changes:** 
1. Created separate CTEs for each dimension table with their filters applied early (`filtered_date`, `filtered_store`, `filtered_customer_demographics`, `filtered_customer`)
2. Materialized the fact table join with date dimension into `filtered_store_returns` CTE
3. Pre-computed store averages in `store_averages` CTE to eliminate correlated subquery
4. Converted implicit joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax for better optimizer planning
5. Preserved all original filters and business logic

**Expected speedup:** ~2.5-3.5x by eliminating correlated subquery overhead, reducing join sizes via early filtering, and enabling better hash join planning with tiny dimension CTEs.
