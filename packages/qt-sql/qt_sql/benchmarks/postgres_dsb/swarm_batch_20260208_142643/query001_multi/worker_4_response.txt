**Changes**: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing store-level thresholds in a separate CTE using the same base CTE, then joined directly. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x by eliminating per-row correlated subquery execution and enabling hash joins with pre-aggregated thresholds.
