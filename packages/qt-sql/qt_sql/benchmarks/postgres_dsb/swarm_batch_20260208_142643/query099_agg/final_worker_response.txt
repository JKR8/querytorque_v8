**Changes:**
1. Created CTEs for each dimension table with their filters applied early.
2. Pushed the date range filter into a CTE and joined it directly with catalog_sales to filter rows before aggregation.
3. Moved the bucket aggregation logic into a separate CTE that processes only the filtered fact rows, grouping by foreign keys.
4. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup:** ~2.5-3x by reducing the catalog_sales scan size through early date filtering and performing aggregation before the multi-way dimension joins.
