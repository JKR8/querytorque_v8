WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_joins
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit LEFT JOIN syntax while pushing filters down to tables early in the plan to reduce row counts before joins.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Pre-filter the highly selective date_dim range and item/warehouse dimensions into CTEs, then join with explicit JOIN ordering to minimize intermediate results.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialize
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize all pre-filtered dimension and fact tables into separate CTEs, then restructure the left join using a decomposed approach to avoid redundant catalog_sales scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_leftjoin_to_exists
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform the left outer join to an EXISTS correlated subquery or a UNION ALL pattern to eliminate null-producing joins, and apply pre-filtering in the subqueries for early aggregation.
