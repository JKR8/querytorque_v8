Changes: Rewrote query using LATERAL joins to push customer_address and web_sales filters into fact table access, decomposed OR conditions into three UNION ALL branches with simplified WHERE clauses, materialized date_dim filter in CTE, and preserved all original columns with conditional aggregation in a single pass per branch.
Expected speedup: 2.5-3.5x due to filter pushdown, simplified branch conditions, and reduced scanning of large fact tables.
