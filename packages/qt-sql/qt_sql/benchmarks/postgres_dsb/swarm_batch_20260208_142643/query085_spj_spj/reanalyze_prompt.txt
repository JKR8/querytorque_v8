## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_explicit_joins
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: column "ca_state" does not exist
LINE 56:       ca_state IN ('IA', 'PA', 'TX')
               ^

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
- **Strategy hint**: Convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better cardinality estimation, push selective filters (date_dim, customer_address) earliest possible, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining.

- **Status**: pass (0.33x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate selective date_dim filter into a CTE, pre-filter all dimension tables (cd1, cd2, customer_address, reason) into separate CTEs, then join with fact tables using explicit joins.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim

- **Error**: canceling statement due to statement timeout

- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
- **Strategy hint**: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact subsets (web_sales, web_returns) into CTEs, then perform joins; consider splitting OR conditions into separate CTEs for union-based recombination.

WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk

### Worker 4: novel_or_to_union_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.49x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions into UNION of separate subqueries, use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS for correlation elimination, and restructure joins to reduce Cartesian product risks in the disjunctive predicates.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
