**Changes:** 
- Transformed the complex OR conditions into 9 separate UNION ALL branches (3×3 combinations of demographic and address filters)
- Created a CTE for filtered dates early to reduce join size
- Materialized the core web_sales/web_returns join with date filter into a CTE
- Used explicit JOIN syntax throughout for better optimizer control

**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x due to eliminating Cartesian product risks in OR conditions, allowing better join ordering per branch, and early filtering of fact tables.
