## Optimization Strategy: refined_snipe

**Your approach**: CONTEXT: Best result: W4 achieved 0.49x via novel_or_to_union_restructure. Your goal: optimize the ORIGINAL SQL to >=2.0x. Try a DIFFERENT approach.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Apply the same query085 demographic/state/profit and return-join filters, returning minimum representative keys/measures.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~33k rows
**Outputs**: [MIN(ws_quantity), MIN(wr_refunded_cash), MIN(wr_fee), MIN(ws_item_sk), MIN(wr_order_number), MIN(cd1.cd_demo_sk), MIN(cd2.cd_demo_sk)]
**Dependencies**: web_sales, web_returns (join), web_page (join), customer_demographics AS cd1 (join), customer_demographics AS cd2 (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), reason (join)
**Joins**: ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk | ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk | ws_order_number = wr_order_number | ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk | cd1.cd_demo_sk = wr_refunded_cdemo_sk | cd2.cd_demo_sk = wr_returning_cdemo_sk | ca_address_sk = wr_refunded_addr_sk | r_reason_sk = wr_reason_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 1998
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[web_returns], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(ws_quantity),
  MIN(wr_refunded_cash),
  MIN(wr_fee),
  MIN(ws_item_sk),
  MIN(wr_order_number),
  MIN(cd1.cd_demo_sk),
  MIN(cd2.cd_demo_sk)
FROM web_sales, web_returns, web_page, customer_demographics AS cd1, customer_demographics AS cd2, customer_address, date_dim, reason
WHERE
  ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk
  AND ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk
  AND ws_order_number = wr_order_number
  AND ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND d_year = 1998
  AND cd1.cd_demo_sk = wr_refunded_cdemo_sk

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. early_filter_decorrelate (1.13x)

**Principle:** Early Selection + Decorrelation: push dimension filters into CTE definitions before materialization, and decorrelate correlated subqueries by pre-computing thresholds in separate CTEs. Filters reduce rows early; decorrelation replaces per-row subquery execution with a single pre-computed JOIN.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
         sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
         sr_reason_sk AS ctr_reason_sk,
         SUM(SR_REFUNDED_CASH) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    AND d_year = 2001
    AND sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 236 AND 295
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk
)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1, store, customer, customer_demographics
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return ctr2
    WHERE ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND ctr1.ctr_reason_sk BETWEEN 28 AND 31
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state IN ('MI', 'NC', 'WI')
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
  AND cd_marital_status IN ('W', 'W')
  AND cd_education_status IN ('4 yr Degree', 'College')
  AND cd_gender = 'M'
  AND c_birth_month = 5
  AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1956
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

**AFTER (fast):**
```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
    SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
           sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
           sr_reason_sk AS ctr_reason_sk,
           SUM(SR_REFUNDED_CASH) AS ctr_total_return
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN date_dim ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
    JOIN store ON sr_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE d_year = 2001
      AND s_state IN ('MI', 'NC', 'WI')
      AND sr_return_amt / sr_return_quantity BETWEEN 236 AND 295
    GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_reason_sk
),
store_thresholds AS (
    SELECT ctr_store_sk,
           AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_limit
    FROM customer_total_return
    GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
)
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return ctr1
JOIN store_thresholds st ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = st.ctr_store_sk
JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
JOIN customer_demographics ON c_current_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
JOIN store s ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > st.avg_limit
  AND ctr1.ctr_reason_sk BETWEEN 28 AND 31
  AND s.s_state IN ('MI', 'NC', 'WI')
  AND cd_marital_status = 'W'
  AND cd_education_status IN ('4 yr Degree', 'College')
  AND cd_gender = 'M'
  AND c_birth_month = 5
  AND c_birth_year BETWEEN 1950 AND 1956
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `MIN(ws_quantity)`
  2. `MIN(wr_refunded_cash)`
  3. `MIN(wr_fee)`
  4. `MIN(ws_item_sk)`
  5. `MIN(wr_order_number)`
  6. `MIN(cd1.cd_demo_sk)`
  7. `MIN(cd2.cd_demo_sk)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
