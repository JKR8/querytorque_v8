WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_explicit_joins
EXAMPLES: early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star
HINT: Convert implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better cardinality estimation, push selective filters (date_dim, customer_address) earliest possible, and pre-filter dimension tables before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: pg_date_cte_explicit_join, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter
HINT: Isolate selective date_dim filter into a CTE, pre-filter all dimension tables (cd1, cd2, customer_address, reason) into separate CTEs, then join with fact tables using explicit joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_materialization
EXAMPLES: pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter, pg_dimension_prefetch_star, pg_self_join_decomposition
HINT: Materialize pre-filtered dimension and fact subsets (web_sales, web_returns) into CTEs, then perform joins; consider splitting OR conditions into separate CTEs for union-based recombination.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_to_union_restructure
EXAMPLES: pg_self_join_decomposition, early_filter_decorrelate, pg_date_cte_explicit_join
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION of separate subqueries, use EXISTS/NOT EXISTS for correlation elimination, and restructure joins to reduce Cartesian product risks in the disjunctive predicates.
