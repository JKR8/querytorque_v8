You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and suggested rewrite patterns.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query091_spj_spj

```sql
SELECT
  MIN(cc_call_center_id),
  MIN(cc_name),
  MIN(cc_manager),
  MIN(cr_net_loss),
  MIN(cr_item_sk),
  MIN(cr_order_number)
FROM call_center, catalog_returns, date_dim, customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics
WHERE
  cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk
  AND cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  AND cr_returning_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND ca_address_sk = c_current_addr_sk
  AND d_year = 1999
  AND d_moy = 1
  AND (
    (
      cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_education_status = 'Unknown'
    )
    OR (
      cd_marital_status = 'W' AND cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree'
    )
  )
  AND hd_buy_potential LIKE '1001-5000%'
  AND ca_gmt_offset = -7
```

## DAG Topology

```sql
-- DAG TOPOLOGY
-- Depth 0:
--   main_query (main, 100% cost)
--     outputs: [MIN(cc_call_center_id), MIN(cc_name), MIN(cc_manager), MIN(cr_net_loss), MIN(cr_item_sk), MIN(cr_order_number)]
```

## Performance Profile

**main_query**: 100% of total cost, ~1,000 rows
  operators: SEQ_SCAN[call_center], SEQ_SCAN[catalog_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]

## Suggested Rewrite Strategy

Phase 2 analysis identified these optimization opportunities:

- **main_query** → apply **or_to_union**
  Heuristic: 100.0% cost, flags=[]

## Reference Examples

### 1. LIKE_PREFIX_INDEX_USAGE (unknown)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
-- May not use index with non-C collation
      SELECT * FROM paths WHERE path LIKE '/media/photos/%';
```

**Key insight:** Prefix searches on text columns in non-C collation databases.

### 2. pg_materialized_dimension_fact_prefilter (2.68x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq,
  sum(case when p_promo_sk is null then 1 else 0 end) no_promo,
  sum(case when p_promo_sk is not null then 1 else 0 end) promo,
  count(*) total_cnt
from catalog_sales
join inventory on (cs_item_sk = inv_item_sk)
join warehouse on (w_warehouse_sk=inv_warehouse_sk)
join item on (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
join customer_demographics on (cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk)
join household_demographics on (cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk)
join date_dim d1 on (cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d2 on (inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk)
join date_dim d3 on (cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk)
left outer join promotion on (cs_promo_sk=p_promo_sk)
left outer join catalog_returns on (cr_item_sk = cs_item_sk and cr_order_number = cs_order_number)
where d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq
  and inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity
  and d3.d_date > d1.d_date + interval '3 day'
  and hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
  and d1.d_year = 1998
  and cd_marital_status = 'M'
  and cd_dep_count between 9 and 11
  and i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
  and cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
group by i_item_desc,w_warehouse_name,d1.d_week_seq
order by total_cnt desc, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq
limit 100
```

**Key insight:** When a query has expensive non-equi joins (inv_quantity < cs_quantity, d_week_seq correlation across 3 date_dim instances), reducing BOTH dimension AND fact table sizes before the join dramatically shrinks the search space. MATERIALIZED CTEs on PG12+ force early execution. The fact table CTE (cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN x AND y) removes ~70% of catalog_sales rows before hitting the inventory join. Combined with tiny dimension CTEs (date: ~365 rows from 73K, item: 3 categories, cd/hd: single-value filters), the optimizer gets much smaller inputs for the expensive joins.

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_date]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_date, d_week_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 1998
```
[filtered_item]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_desc FROM item WHERE i_category IN ('Home', 'Men', 'Music')
```
[filtered_cd]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_marital_status = 'M' AND cd_dep_count BETWEEN 9 AND 11
```
[filtered_hd]:
```sql
SELECT hd_demo_sk FROM household_demographics WHERE hd_buy_potential = '501-1000'
```
[cs_filtered]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_bill_cdemo_sk, cs_bill_hdemo_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_ship_date_sk, cs_promo_sk, cs_quantity, cs_wholesale_cost, cs_order_number FROM catalog_sales WHERE cs_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 34 AND 54
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq, SUM(CASE WHEN p.p_promo_sk IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_promo, SUM(CASE WHEN p.p_promo_sk IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS promo, COUNT(*) AS total_cnt FROM cs_filtered cs JOIN inventory inv ON cs.cs_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk JOIN warehouse w ON w.w_warehouse_sk = inv.inv_warehouse_sk JOIN filtered_item i ON i.i_item_sk = cs.cs_item_sk JOIN filtered_cd cd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_hd hd ON cs.cs_bill_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_date d1 ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk JOIN date_dim d2 ON inv.inv_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk JOIN date_dim d3 ON cs.cs_ship_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk LEFT OUTER JOIN promotion p ON cs.cs_promo_sk = p.p_promo_sk LEFT OUTER JOIN catalog_returns cr ON cr.cr_item_sk = cs.cs_item_sk AND cr.cr_order_number = cs.cs_order_number WHERE d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq AND inv.inv_quantity_on_hand < cs.cs_quantity AND d3.d_date > d1.d_date + INTERVAL '3 day' GROUP BY i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq ORDER BY total_cnt DESC, i.i_item_desc, w.w_warehouse_name, d1.d_week_seq LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and
ordering as the original. This is the prime directive.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
Keep all literal values (dates, strings, numbers) exactly as they appear in
the original SQL. Do not round, truncate, or reformat them.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIM_CTE**
When creating a new CTE that scans a dimension table, include at least one
filter predicate. Never materialize an entire dimension without a WHERE clause.

**OR_TO_UNION_LIMIT**
When converting OR predicates to UNION ALL, limit to 4 branches maximum.
Beyond 4, the UNION overhead exceeds the OR scan cost for most planners.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax.
This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do not convert them to
IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes.

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT.
Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
