You are a SQL query rewrite engine for PostgreSQL v16.11-0ubuntu0.24.04.1).

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query084_agg

```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id AS customer_id,
  COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income_band, store_returns
WHERE
  ca_city = 'Lakeview'
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ib_lower_bound >= 69452
  AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
  AND ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Return customers in Lakeview whose current demographic/household/income-band profile matches store-return demographics within the target income range.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~276k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [customer_id, customername] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer, customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), income_band (join), store_returns (join)
**Joins**: c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk | ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk | cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk | hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk | sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
**Filters**: ca_city = 'Lakeview' | ib_lower_bound >= 69452 | ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[household_demographics], SEQ_SCAN[income_band], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id AS customer_id,
  COALESCE(c_last_name, '') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name, '') AS customername
FROM customer, customer_address, customer_demographics, household_demographics, income_band, store_returns
WHERE
  ca_city = 'Lakeview'
  AND c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ib_lower_bound >= 69452
  AND ib_upper_bound <= 69452 + 50000
  AND ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
  AND cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
  AND hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
  AND sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customername`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
