## Role

You are **W3 "Builder"** — Structural optimization — join restructuring, materialization. Restructure join topology and materialize repeated work: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, extract shared scans into CTEs, prefetch dimension tables.

Transform this SQL query from its CURRENT IR structure to a TARGET IR structure using patch operations. Output a single PatchPlan JSON.

**Family**: E+F — date_dim_prefetch+explicit_join_conversion
**Hypothesis**: Repeated date_dim scans with identical filters (d_year=2001, d_qoy<4) across 3 subqueries. Materialize once. | Comma-join obscures join dependencies. Convert to explicit INNER JOINs for better predicate pushdown.

## Patch Operations

| Op | Description | Payload |
|----|-------------|---------|
| insert_cte | Add a new CTE to the WITH clause | cte_name, cte_query_sql |
| replace_from | Replace the FROM clause | from_sql |
| replace_where_predicate | Replace the WHERE clause | expr_sql |
| replace_body | Replace entire query body (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY) | sql_fragment |
| replace_expr_subtree | Replace a specific expression | expr_sql (+ by_anchor_hash) |
| delete_expr_subtree | Remove a specific expression | (target only, no payload) |

## Instructions

Adapt the gold example pattern to match the ORIGINAL SQL above.
Use the TARGET IR as your structural guide — create CTEs matching the target's CTE names and structure.
Preferred approach: insert_cte (x2-3) + replace_from or replace_body.
All SQL in payloads must be complete, executable fragments (no ellipsis).
Use dialect: "duckdb" in the output.
Target all steps at by_node_id: "S0" (the main statement).

Output ONLY the JSON object (no markdown, no explanation):
