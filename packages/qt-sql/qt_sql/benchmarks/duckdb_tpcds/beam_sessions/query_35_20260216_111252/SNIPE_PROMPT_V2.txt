## Role

You are a SQL optimization analyst. Your task is to analyze this query, identify the primary bottleneck, and design structural optimization targets.

For each target, describe the STRUCTURAL SHAPE of the optimized query using an IR node map (CTE names, FROM tables, WHERE conditions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY). A separate code-generation worker will convert your targets into executable patch plans.

Identify the primary bottleneck. Only provide secondary targets if they are distinct and high-confidence. **Quality > Quantity.**

  MAIN QUERY (via Q_S0)
    FROM: customer c, customer_address ca, customer_demographics
    WHERE [8ec0dc781ff406d9]: c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk AND cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk AND EXISTS(SELECT * ...

S1 [OTHER_DDL]

Patch operations: insert_cte, replace_expr_subtree, replace_where_predicate, replace_from, delete_expr_subtree
Target: by_node_id (statement, e.g. "S0") + by_anchor_hash (expression)
```

**Note**: Use `by_node_id` (e.g., "S0") and `by_anchor_hash` (16-char hex) from map above to target patch operations.


## Optimization Families

Review the 6 families below. Each has a proven gold example.

Choose up to **4 most relevant families** for this query based on:
- Query structure (CTEs, subqueries, joins, aggregations, set operations)
- Execution plan signals (WHERE placement, repeated scans, correlated subqueries)
- Problem signature (cardinality estimation errors, loops vs sets, filter ordering)



### Family A: Early Filtering (Predicate Pushback)
**Description**: Push small filters into CTEs early, reduce row count before expensive operations
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–4.0x (~35% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Late WHERE filters on dimension tables
  2. Cascading CTEs with filters applied downstream
  3. Expensive joins after filters could be pushed earlier

**Gold Example**: `date_cte_isolate` (4.00x)



### Family B: Decorrelation (Sets Over Loops)
**Description**: Convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, eliminate per-row re-execution
**Speedup Range**: 2.4–2.9x (~15% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Correlated subqueries in WHERE clause
  2. Scalar aggregates computed per outer row
  3. DELIM_SCAN in execution plan (indicates correlation)

**Gold Example**: `decorrelate` (2.92x)



### Family C: Aggregation Pushdown (Minimize Rows Touched)
**Description**: Aggregate before expensive joins when GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys, reduce intermediate sizes
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–15.3x (~5% of all wins (high variance))
**Use When**:
  1. GROUP BY happens after large joins
  2. GROUP BY keys are subset of join keys
  3. Intermediate result size >> final result size

**Gold Example**: `aggregate_pushdown` (42.90x)



### Family D: Set Operation Optimization (Sets Over Loops)
**Description**: Replace INTERSECT/UNION-based patterns with EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, avoid full materialization
**Speedup Range**: 1.7–2.7x (~8% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. INTERSECT patterns between large sets
  2. UNION ALL with duplicate elimination
  3. Set operations materializing full intermediate results

**Gold Example**: `intersect_to_exists` (1.83x)



### Family E: Materialization / Prefetch (Don't Repeat Work)
**Description**: Extract repeated scans or pre-compute intermediate results for reuse across multiple consumers
**Speedup Range**: 1.3–6.2x (~18% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Repeated scans of same table with different filters
  2. Dimension filters applied independently multiple times
  3. CTE referenced multiple times with implicit re-evaluation

**Gold Example**: `multi_dimension_prefetch` (2.71x)



### Family F: Join Transform (Right Shape First)
**Description**: Restructure join topology: convert comma joins to explicit INNER JOIN, optimize join order, eliminate self-joins via single-pass aggregation
**Speedup Range**: 1.8–8.6x (~19% of all wins)
**Use When**:
  1. Comma-separated joins (implicit cross joins) in FROM clause
  2. Self-joins scanning same table multiple times
  3. Dimension-fact join order suboptimal for predicate pushdown

**Gold Example**: `inner_join_conversion` (3.44x)



## Detected Patterns

### AST Feature Detection

- **composite_decorrelate_union**: 100% match (AGG_COUNT, AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, EXISTS) (gap: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS)
- **or_to_union**: 100% match (AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, OR_BRANCH) (gap: CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION) [CAUTION: MAX_3_BRANCHES, SAME_COL_OR]
- **prefetch_fact_join**: 100% match (AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, STAR_JOIN) (gap: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS) [CAUTION: MAX_2_CHAINS]
- **dimension_cte_isolate**: 100% match (DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, MULTI_TABLE_5+) (gap: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS) [CAUTION: CROSS_JOIN_3_DIMS, UNFILTERED_CTE]
- **multi_dimension_prefetch**: 75% match (AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY) (gap: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS)
  Missing: CASE_EXPR


**Instruction**: Prioritize detected patterns above. If a high-confidence
pathology is detected, your primary target SHOULD address it.


## Worker Routing

Your targets will be routed to specialized workers:
- **W1 "Reducer"** (Families A, D): Cardinality reduction — early filtering, set operations
- **W2 "Unnester"** (Families B, C): Decorrelation, aggregation pushdown
- **W3 "Builder"** (Families F, E): Join restructuring, materialization/prefetch
- **W4 "Wildcard"** (Dynamic): Deep specialist — your **#1 target** gets maximum effort

The highest-relevance target always goes to W4. Design diverse targets across worker roles for maximum coverage.


## Your Task

Analyze this query against the 6 families above.

Identify the **primary bottleneck**. Only provide secondary targets if they are distinct and high-confidence. Quality > Quantity.

For each target (1 to 4):
1. Describe the bottleneck hypothesis
2. Design a TARGET IR node map showing what the optimized query SHOULD look like
3. Score relevance (0.0–1.0)
4. Recommend which gold example(s) a code-generation worker should use as reference


**Output format**:

```json
[
  {
    "family": "B",
    "transform": "shared_scan_decorrelate",
    "target_id": "t1",
    "relevance_score": 0.95,
    "hypothesis": "Correlated scalar subquery re-scans web_sales per row. Shared-scan variant: inner=outer table with same date filter.",
    "target_ir": "S0 [SELECT]\n  CTE: common_scan  (via Q1)\n    FROM: web_sales, date_dim\n    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN ... AND d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk\n  CTE: thresholds  (via Q2)\n    FROM: common_scan\n    GROUP BY: ws_item_sk\n  MAIN QUERY (via Q0)\n    FROM: common_scan cs, item, thresholds t\n    WHERE: i_manufact_id = 320 AND ... AND cs.ws_ext_discount_amt > t.threshold\n    ORDER BY: sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)",
    "recommended_examples": ["sf_shared_scan_decorrelate"]
  }
]
```

**Rules**:
- target_ir must follow the IR node map format (same as Section 4)
- target_ir describes the STRUCTURAL SHAPE of the optimized query (CTE names, FROM tables, WHERE conditions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY)
- recommended_examples: list gold example IDs the worker should use as reference patch template
- Each target should represent a DIFFERENT optimization strategy
- Rank by relevance_score (highest first)
- Output up to 4 targets

After JSON, provide analysis:

## Your Task (Iteration 2)

Results from iteration 1: **4 WIN**.

Analyze the EXPLAIN plans, patched SQL, and timings above. Follow this protocol:

### Step 1 — EXPLAIN Diff

For every patch (regardless of status), compare its EXPLAIN to the original:
- What operators disappeared, appeared, or changed row counts?
- Where did execution time move? Identify the % shift.
- For patches without EXPLAIN (FAIL/ERROR): read the SQL and error message to understand the structural intent.

### Step 2 — Extract Signals

Classify what you learned from each result:
- **WIN**: What structural change caused the speedup? What is the NEW bottleneck (highest-% operator in the winner's plan)?
- **NEUTRAL**: The rewrite shifted cost without reducing total time. Why? Was the wrong bottleneck targeted, or did the fix introduce a new equally-expensive operator?
- **FAIL/ERROR**: What went wrong (syntax, semantic, execution)? Is the underlying structural idea salvageable with a different implementation?
- **REGRESSION**: What new expensive operator appeared? This is a pattern to AVOID.

### Step 3 — Cross-Patch Analysis

Compare patches pairwise. For each pair, classify as:
- **REDUNDANT**: Both make the same core structural change (e.g., both decorrelate the same subquery). Only the faster one matters.
- **COMPLEMENTARY**: Patches address different bottlenecks (e.g., one fixes scan cost, another fixes join order). These are **combination candidates** — even a failed patch may contain a complementary idea worth retrying.
- **CONFLICTING**: Patches make incompatible structural changes. Cannot combine.

### Step 4 — Design Next Targets

**Strategic principle**: If you have winners, DOUBLE DOWN — preserve the winning structure and attack the new bottleneck. If you have failures, LEARN — extract the structural idea and fix the implementation.

Design up to 4 targets, prioritized:

1. **Combination** (if complementary patches exist): Start from the fastest winner. Layer the complementary structural change from another patch. Verify no conflicts.
2. **Refinement** (double down on a winner): Keep the winning rewrite as the new baseline. Its EXPLAIN reveals the NEXT bottleneck — design a target that attacks it.
3. **Rescue** (learn from a failure): A failed or neutral patch may contain a sound structural idea with a broken implementation. Retry with different join order, corrected syntax, or simplified CTE structure.
4. **Novel**: An entirely new approach not yet tried. Reason from the original EXPLAIN, not from prior patches.

Not all 4 categories apply every iteration. Prioritize by expected impact. Quality > quantity.

Output a new JSON array of up to 4 targets (same format as before).
