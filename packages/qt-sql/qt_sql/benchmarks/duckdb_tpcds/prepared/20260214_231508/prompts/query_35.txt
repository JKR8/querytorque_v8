## §I. ROLE

You are a senior query optimization architect. You analyze slow queries by reasoning about data flow: where rows enter the plan, how they multiply or reduce at each operator, and where the engine wastes work relative to the theoretical minimum.

Your diagnostic lens is six principles. Every slow query violates at least one:

1. **MINIMIZE ROWS TOUCHED** — Every row that doesn't contribute to output is waste.
2. **SMALLEST SET FIRST** — Most selective filter applied earliest. Selectivity compounds.
3. **DON'T REPEAT WORK** — Scan once, compute once, materialize once if needed by many.
4. **SETS OVER LOOPS** — Set operations parallelize. Row-by-row re-execution doesn't.
5. **ARM THE OPTIMIZER** — Restructure so it has full intelligence. Don't force plans.
6. **MINIMIZE DATA MOVEMENT** — Large intermediates built then mostly discarded are waste.

Your primary asset is a library of **gold examples** — proven before/after SQL rewrites with measured speedups gathered from hundreds of benchmark runs. Correctly matching a query to the right gold examples is the single highest-leverage step in this process. The gold example's before/after SQL is a structural template — you adapt the pattern to this query. The diagnosis tells you what's wrong; the examples show exactly how to fix it.

You analyze the query, determine the single best optimization strategy, and produce the optimized SQL directly.

### A. Original SQL: query_35 (duckdb)

**Intent:** Profile household dependent metrics by state and customer demographics for customers who purchased in store during 2001 Q1-Q3 and also purchased via web or catalog in the same period.

### D. Estimation Errors

### §2b-i. Cardinality Estimation Routing (Q-Error)

Direction: ZERO_EST (planner estimated 0 — no statistics propagated (CTE/subquery boundary))
Locus: SCAN — worst mismatch at DELIM_SCAN (est=280K, act=0)

Pathology routing: P2, P0
(Locus+Direction routing is 85% accurate at predicting where the winning transform operates)

Structural signals:
  - EST_ZERO: blind to CTE/subquery stats → push predicate into CTE (P0, P7)
  - DELIM_SCAN: correlated subquery the optimizer couldn't decorrelate → P2

IMPORTANT: Cross-check structural signals against the PRUNING GUIDE in §III. If the EXPLAIN shows no nested loops, skip P2. If each table appears once, skip P1. The pruning guide overrides routing suggestions.

## §III. THIS ENGINE

### DuckDB

Evidence-based exploit algorithm. Use Detect rules to match structural features, then apply the Treatments for matching cases.

# DuckDB Rewrite Playbook
# TPC-DS SF1–SF10 field intelligence

## ENGINE STRENGTHS — do NOT rewrite

1. **Predicate pushdown**: filter inside scan node → leave it.
2. **Same-column OR**: handled natively in one scan. Splitting = lethal (0.23x observed).
3. **Hash join selection**: sound for 2–4 tables. Reduce inputs, not order.
4. **CTE inlining**: single-ref CTEs inlined automatically (zero overhead).
5. **Columnar projection**: only referenced columns read.
6. **Parallel aggregation**: scans and aggregations parallelized across threads.
7. **EXISTS semi-join**: early termination. **Never materialize** (0.14x observed).

## GLOBAL GUARDS

1. EXISTS/NOT EXISTS → never materialize (0.14x, 0.54x — semi-join destroyed)
2. Same-column OR → never split to UNION (0.23x, 0.59x — native OR handling)
3. Baseline < 100ms → skip CTE-based rewrites (overhead exceeds savings)
4. 3+ fact table joins → do not pre-materialize facts (locks join order)
5. Every CTE MUST have a WHERE clause (0.85x observed)
6. No orphaned CTEs — remove original after splitting (0.49x, 0.68x — double materialization)
7. No cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs (0.0076x — Cartesian product)
8. Max 2 cascading fact-table CTE chains (0.78x observed)
9. Convert comma joins to explicit JOIN...ON
10. NOT EXISTS → NOT IN breaks with NULLs — preserve EXISTS form

## DOCUMENTED CASES

Cases ordered by safety (zero-regression cases first, then by decreasing risk).

**P0: Predicate Chain Pushback** (SMALLEST SET FIRST) — ~35% of wins

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | Row counts flat through CTE chain, sharp drop at late filter. 2+ stage CTE chain + late predicate with columns available earlier. |
| Gates | Filter ratio >5:1 strong, 2:1–5:1 moderate if baseline >200ms, <2:1 skip. 1 fact = safe, 2 = careful, 3+ = STOP (0.50x). ROLLUP/WINDOW downstream: CAUTION (0.85x). CTE already filtered on this predicate: skip (0.71x). |
| Treatments | date_cte_isolate (12 wins, 1.34x avg), prefetch_fact_join (4 wins, 1.89x avg), multi_dimension_prefetch (3 wins, 1.55x avg), multi_date_range_cte (3 wins, 1.42x avg), shared_dimension_multi_channel (1 win, 1.40x), self_join_decomposition (1 win, 4.76x) |
| Failures | 0.0076x (3 dim CTE cross-join → Cartesian), 0.50x (3-fact join lock), 0.85x (ROLLUP blocked), 0.71x (over-decomposed) |

**P1: Repeated Scans of Same Table** (DON'T REPEAT WORK) — ZERO REGRESSIONS

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | N separate SEQ_SCAN nodes on same table, identical joins, different bucket filters. |
| Gates | Identical join structure across all subqueries, max 8 branches, COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX only (not STDDEV/VARIANCE/PERCENTILE). |
| Treatments | single_pass_aggregation (8 wins, 1.88x avg), channel_bitmap_aggregation (1 win, 6.24x) |
| Failures | None observed. |

**P3: Aggregation After Join** (MINIMIZE ROWS TOUCHED) — ZERO REGRESSIONS

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | GROUP BY input rows >> distinct keys, aggregate node sits after join. |
| Gates | GROUP BY keys ⊇ join keys (CORRECTNESS). Reconstruct AVG from SUM/COUNT when pre-aggregating for ROLLUP. |
| Treatments | aggregate_pushdown, star_join_prefetch. 3 wins (1.3x–42.9x, avg 15.3x). |
| Failures | None observed. |

**P5: LEFT JOIN + NULL-Eliminating WHERE** (ARM THE OPTIMIZER) — ZERO REGRESSIONS

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | LEFT JOIN + WHERE on right-table column (proves right non-null). |
| Gates | No CASE WHEN IS NULL / COALESCE on right-table column. |
| Treatments | inner_join_conversion. 2 wins (1.9x–3.4x, avg 2.7x). |
| Failures | None observed. |

**P6: INTERSECT Materializing Both Sides** (SETS OVER LOOPS) — ZERO REGRESSIONS

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | INTERSECT between 10K+ row result sets. |
| Gates | Both sides >1K rows. |
| Treatments | intersect_to_exists, multi_intersect_exists_cte. 1 win (2.7x). Related: semi_join_exists (1.67x). |
| Failures | None observed. |

**P8: Window Functions in CTEs Before Join** (MINIMIZE ROWS TOUCHED) — ZERO REGRESSIONS

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | N WINDOW nodes inside CTEs, same ORDER BY key, CTEs then joined. |
| Gates | Not LAG/LEAD (depends on pre-join row order), not ROWS BETWEEN with specific frame. SUM() OVER() naturally skips NULLs. |
| Treatments | deferred_window_aggregation. 1 win (1.4x). |
| Failures | None observed. |

**P7: Self-Joined CTE Materialized for All Values** (SMALLEST SET FIRST)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | CTE joined to itself with different WHERE per arm (e.g., period=1 vs period=2). |
| Gates | 2–4 discriminator values, MUST remove original combined CTE after splitting. |
| Treatments | self_join_decomposition (1 win, 4.76x), union_cte_split (2 wins, 1.72x avg), rollup_to_union_windowing (1 win, 2.47x) |
| Failures | 0.49x (orphaned CTE → double materialization), 0.68x (orphaned variant) |

**P2: Correlated Subquery Nested Loop** (SETS OVER LOOPS)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | Nested loop, inner re-executes aggregate per outer row. If EXPLAIN shows hash join on correlation key → already decorrelated → STOP. |
| Gates | NEVER decorrelate EXISTS (0.34x, 0.14x — semi-join destroyed). Preserve ALL WHERE filters. Check if Phase 1 reduced outer to <1000 rows (nested loop may be fast enough). |
| Treatments | decorrelate (3 wins, 2.45x avg), composite_decorrelate_union (1 win, 2.42x) |
| Failures | 0.34x (semi-join destroyed), 0.71x (already decorrelated) |

**P9: Shared Subexpression Executed Multiple Times** (DON'T REPEAT WORK)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | Identical subtrees with identical costs scanning same tables. HARD STOP: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS → NEVER materialize (0.14x). |
| Gates | NOT EXISTS, subquery is expensive (joins/aggregates), CTE must have WHERE. |
| Treatments | materialize_cte. 1 win (1.4x). |
| Failures | 0.14x (EXISTS materialized → semi-join destroyed), 0.54x (correlated EXISTS pairs broken) |

**P4: Cross-Column OR Forcing Full Scan** (MINIMIZE ROWS TOUCHED) — HIGHEST VARIANCE

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Detect | Single scan, OR across DIFFERENT columns, 70%+ rows discarded. CRITICAL: same column in all OR arms → STOP (engine handles natively). |
| Gates | Max 3 branches, cross-column only, no self-join, no nested OR (multiplicative expansion). |
| Treatments | or_to_union. 4 wins (1.4x–6.3x, avg 3.1x). |
| Failures | 0.23x (9 branches from nested OR), 0.41x (nested OR expansion), 0.59x (same-col split), 0.51x (self-join re-executed per branch) |

## §IV. CONSTRAINTS

- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.
- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

**Aggregation:** This query uses COUNT, MAX, SUM — all safe. No STDDEV/VARIANCE traps.

## §V. INVESTIGATE

Work in `<reasoning>`. Follow this investigation process:

**Step 1: Analyze the Current Plan.** Read the cost spine and EXPLAIN in §II.B. Identify the red flags: where is time going? What's the running rowcount at each stage? Where does it fail to decrease?

**Step 2: Read the Map.** Use the query map (§II.C) to understand the data shape. Identify the driving table, best entry point, filter ratios, join ratios, and join directions.

**Step 3: Deduce the Optimal Path.** From the map, work out the ideal join order:

- Start from the best entry point (most selective filter)
- Follow reducing joins first (downward/semi)
- Pick up filters early to shrink the running rowcount at every step
- Defer expanding joins and pure attribute lookups until last
- Compute the running rowcount at each step of your optimal path

**Step 4: Diagnose the Gap.** Compare your optimal path (Step 3) to the actual plan (Step 1). For each divergence:

- Name the violated goal (§I)
- Check if an engine blind spot from §III explains it. If yes, name it. If no, you've found a novel blind spot — describe the mechanism: what information is the optimizer missing or what structural pattern is it failing to optimize?
- Quantify: how many excess rows flow because of this divergence?

This diagnosis is complete and actionable on its own. Steps 1–4 give you everything you need to design an intervention, even for problems you've never seen before.

**Step 5: Match Gold Examples.** This is the highest-leverage step. For each blind spot and goal violation identified in Step 4, search the Example Catalog (§VII.B) for gold examples with matching query structure.

- **Match found**: Use the matching examples as structural templates. Adapt the gold example's before/after SQL pattern to this query — don't invent from scratch when a proven template exists.
- **No match**: Design the intervention from your diagnosis. You know the goal violation, the mechanism, and the excess rowcount — that's sufficient to reason about restructuring. Select the structurally closest examples as partial templates even if no exact match exists.

**Step 6: Select Examples.** For your strategy, select 1–3 examples from the catalog:

*Matching criteria* (in priority order):
1. **Structural similarity** — Does the example's original query have the same shape? (same join pattern, same subquery type, same fact/dim relationship). A multi-channel EXISTS query needs a multi-channel example, not a single-table aggregation example.
2. **Transform relevance** — Does the example demonstrate the specific restructuring this strategy needs? If the strategy is "build keysets per channel," pick examples that build keysets, not examples that push predicates.
3. **Hazard coverage** — Does the example show a pitfall this strategy could hit? An example that failed by materializing EXISTS is MORE valuable for a strategy that's tempted to do that than a safe example.

*Adaptation guidance* — For each assigned example, you MUST specify:
- **APPLY**: Which structural pattern from the example maps to this query (e.g., "the date_dim CTE pattern — isolate qualifying dates first, then join to fact")
- **IGNORE**: Which parts of the example don't apply and WHY (e.g., "ignore the ROLLUP handling — this query has no ROLLUP"). Without this, irrelevant complexity gets copied into the rewrite.
- **ADAPT**: What's different between the example's query and this query that requires modification (e.g., "example has 2 channels, this query has 3 — extend the pattern but don't exceed 2 CTE chains")

*Anti-patterns*:
- Don't assign an example just because it matches the same blind spot if the query structure is fundamentally different
- Don't pad with 3 examples when 1 is a strong match — irrelevant examples dilute attention
- Don't assign examples that demonstrate transforms the strategy ISN'T using

**Step 7: Implement.** Design and implement the single best strategy as working SQL.

Selection rules:
- If the EXPLAIN shows the optimizer already handles something, don't re-do it
- Verify structural prerequisites before assigning transforms

### D. Structural Matches for This Query

Transforms ranked by structural feature overlap with this query. The gap tag shows the example's target blind spot — verify it applies to THIS query's EXPLAIN before using.

- **composite_decorrelate_union** (100%) [targets: CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS] — AGG_COUNT, AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, EXISTS, GROUP_BY, MULTI_TABLE_5+, OR_BRANCH, SCALAR_SUB_2+, TABLE_REPEAT_3+
- **or_to_union** (100%) [targets: CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION] — AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, OR_BRANCH
  ⚠ Max 3 UNION branches — 6+ is lethal (9 branches = 9x fact scans)
  ⚠ NEVER split same-column ORs — engine handles natively
  ⚠ NEVER if self-join present — each branch re-does the self-join
- **prefetch_fact_join** (100%) [targets: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS] — AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, STAR_JOIN
  ⚠ Max 2 cascading fact-table CTE chains — 3rd causes excessive materialization
- **dimension_cte_isolate** (100%) [targets: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS] — DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY, MULTI_TABLE_5+
  ⚠ NEVER cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs — Cartesian explosion
  ⚠ Every CTE must have a WHERE clause — unfiltered CTE = pure overhead
- **multi_dimension_prefetch** (75%) [targets: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS] — AGG_SUM, DATE_DIM, GROUP_BY

### E. What Doesn't Apply

No LEFT JOINs, No INTERSECT, No WINDOW/OVER, No CTE chain in original, No nested loops in EXPLAIN, No correlated subqueries.

**Skip**: P5 (INNER conversion), P6 (set rewrite), P8 (deferred window), P2 (decorrelation).
