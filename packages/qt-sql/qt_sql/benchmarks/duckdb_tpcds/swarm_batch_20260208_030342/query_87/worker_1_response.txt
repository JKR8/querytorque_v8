**Changes**: Extracted date filtering into a CTE (`filtered_dates`) to compute the 12-month window once, then used explicit JOINs to push this filtered dimension early into each sales subquery. This reduces repeated scans of `date_dim` and allows joins to start with fewer rows.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.5–2x due to reduced dimension table scans and earlier filtering of fact table rows.
