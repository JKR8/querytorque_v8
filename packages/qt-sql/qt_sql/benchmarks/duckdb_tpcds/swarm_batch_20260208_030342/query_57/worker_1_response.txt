Changes: Isolated date_dim filtering into a separate CTE to reduce join size early, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimization, simplified the CASE expression in the final filter since avg_monthly_sales > 0 is already guaranteed by the previous condition.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from early date filtering and reduced intermediate data volume.
