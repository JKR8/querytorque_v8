WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables first and push predicates down to reduce intermediate data; use CTEs to avoid recomputing repeated subqueries.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate date and store dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and optimize join ordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact data in CTEs, then restructure aggregations and window functions to minimize passes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, single_pass_aggregation, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform the correlated subquery into a join, consolidate multiple fact table scans, and explore advanced pattern rewrites like INTERSECT-to-EXISTS.
