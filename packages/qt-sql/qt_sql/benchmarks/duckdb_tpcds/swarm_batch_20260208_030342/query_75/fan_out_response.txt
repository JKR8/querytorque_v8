WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Filter dimension tables (item, date_dim) first before joining to large fact tables, push year filters into CTEs, and use CTEs to avoid recomputing identical logic across union branches.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create separate CTEs for filtered date and item dimensions, then reuse them across all three sales channel joins to reduce redundant filtering and enable predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_single_pass
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in dedicated CTEs, then union and aggregate; consider consolidating the two year aggregations into one pass to eliminate the self-join.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, decorrelate, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Split the union into separate CTEs per sales channel for targeted optimization, transform the self-join into a window function to get both years in one row, and explore alternative join structures.
