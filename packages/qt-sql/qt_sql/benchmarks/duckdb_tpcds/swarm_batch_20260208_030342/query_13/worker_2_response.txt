Changes: Isolated all filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address) into separate CTEs with their respective predicates before joining with the fact table (store_sales). This enables better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

Expected speedup: 2.0x-3.0x due to reduced dimension table scans and improved hash join efficiency.
