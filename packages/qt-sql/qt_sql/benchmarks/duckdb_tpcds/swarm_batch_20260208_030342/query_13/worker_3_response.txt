Changes: Restructured query using staged CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address) before joining with the fact table, reducing the working set early and applying OR conditions only to pre-filtered data.

Expected speedup: 2.5-3.5x due to reduced join cardinality and sequential filtering of dimension tables before complex OR evaluation.
