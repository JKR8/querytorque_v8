**Changes**: Restructured into a CTE pipeline: pre-filtered all three dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) into separate CTEs, then joined them with the fact table in a single pre-join CTE, followed by aggregation in a separate CTE. This minimizes full table scans and allows early reduction of fact table rows.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5-3.5x due to reduced dimension table scans and early fact table filtering through selective pre-joins.
