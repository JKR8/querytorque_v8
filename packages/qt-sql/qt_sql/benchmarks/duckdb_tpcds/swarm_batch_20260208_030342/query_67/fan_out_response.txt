WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply conservative filters early to dimension tables, push predicates into subqueries, and use CTEs for clear materialization without risky restructuring.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered date ranges and dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining to fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and join reordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact data in staged CTEs, then consolidate aggregation and window operations to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Experiment with structural transformations: defer window ranking, convert potential OR conditions to UNION ALL, and apply decorrelation patterns even if not directly present.
