Changes: Combined frequent_ss_items and max_store_sales CTEs to scan store_sales once with shared date filter (2000-2003), added pre-filtered date_dim CTEs for both date ranges, converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.
Expected speedup: 2.5-3x reduction in execution time by eliminating redundant store_sales scans and enabling better predicate pushdown.
