You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Identify items sold across all three channels (store, catalog, web) during 2000-2002, then report November 2002 sales per channel for those items where channel sales exceed the 3-year cross-channel average. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics). Aggregates are SUM and COUNT, which are duplicate-safe, but ensure the IN subquery doesn't introduce duplicates. The HAVING filter depends on the scalar avg_sales CTE, which must be computed exactly once.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- EXISTS conditions must check brand/class/category combination, not just item key, to match INTERSECT semantics.
- Ensure the filtered_dates CTE includes d_date_sk for joins.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS subqueries to materialized CTEs; keep as EXISTS.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: Skip if baseline is fast (<100ms), but we lack timing data; assume baseline is large given 9 fact scans.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x regression):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE, eliminate the original UNION.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, sum(sales), sum(number_sales) with ROLLUP.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (item keys, brand/class/category IDs, sales aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep all literal values (2000, 2002, 11, etc.).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filters repeated across CTEs; November filter applied late.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Each fact table scanned 3 times.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- intersect_to_exists: Replace the INTERSECT with EXISTS subqueries as shown in node contracts.
- multi_intersect_exists_cte: Use a shared filtered_dates CTE for all three channels; create separate EXISTS conditions per channel.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `i_brand_id`
  3. `i_class_id`
  4. `i_category_id`
  5. `SUM(sales)`
  6. `SUM(number_sales)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] avg_sales  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute a cross-channel average of quantity*list_price over store, catalog, and web sales for 2000-2002 to serve as the sales threshold.
│   ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, store_sales, catalog_sales)
│   ├── JOIN (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── FILTER (d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2)
│   ├── UNION

├── [CTE] cross_items  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Build the shared item set by intersecting brand/class/category combinations that appear in store, catalog, and web sales during 2000-2002, then map those combinations back to item keys.
│   ├── SCAN (item, web_sales (join), item AS iws (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), store_sales (join), item AS iss (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), catalog_sales (join), item AS ics (join), date_dim AS d2 (join))

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate November 2002 sales for each channel over the cross-channel item set, keep groups above the computed average-sales threshold, union channels, and output rollup subtotals by channel and product hierarchy.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
