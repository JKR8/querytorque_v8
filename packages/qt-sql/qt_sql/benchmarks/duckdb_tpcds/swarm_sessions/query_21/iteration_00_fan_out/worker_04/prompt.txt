You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare inventory levels in 30-day windows before/after 2002-02-27 for low-priced items (0.99-1.49) by warehouse and item, keeping groups where post-period inventory is roughly balanced (ratio 2/3 to 3/2). All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all four tables. The SUM(CASE) aggregation is duplicate-safe, but the ratio filter depends on inv_before > 0. The date filter (d_date ±30 days) must be preserved exactly, and the price filter (i_current_price 0.99-1.49) must remain before aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pivoting period sums requires careful handling to ensure inv_before/inv_after calculated correctly
- Grouping by period_flag then pivoting adds complexity
- Must ensure all necessary columns for final output are preserved
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This strategy doesn't violate any correctness constraints; it restructures aggregation and defers warehouse join but preserves all semantics.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (observed 0.5x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way fact joins, preventing optimizer reordering
   RULE: Do not pre-join inventory with date_dim before other dimension joins if it blocks join reordering
2. dimension_cte_isolate (observed 0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table
3. prefetch_fact_join (observed 0.5x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: Not applicable here (baseline 419ms > 100ms threshold)

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output w_warehouse_name, i_item_id, inv_before, inv_after in same order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any created CTE must include all columns referenced downstream
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve '2002-02-27', 0.99, 1.49, 30 DAY intervals, 2.0/3.0, 3.0/2.0 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Same rows, columns, ordering (w_warehouse_name, i_item_id ASC)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No existing CTEs; creating dimension CTEs can pre-filter before fact join
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (single scan per table)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidating before/after aggregation into one pass with period flag. Ignore that example has multiple scans - we have one scan.
- deferred_window_aggregation: Apply deferring expensive operations (warehouse join) until after aggregation. Ignore window functions - we use aggregation.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply pre-filtering date and item. Ignore keeping all dimensions together - we defer warehouse.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales

from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql

```

### 2. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

```

### 3. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql

```
[main_query]:
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate on-hand inventory in two 30-day windows around 2002-02-27 using CASE splits, then filter warehouse-item groups by the before/after ratio band and return ordered identifiers.
    ├── SCAN (inventory, warehouse, item, date_dim)
    ├── FILTER ((CASE WHEN inv_before > 0 THEN inv_after / inv_before ELSE NULL END) BETWEEN 2.0 / 3.0 AND 3.0 / 2.0)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (w_warehouse_name ASC, i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
