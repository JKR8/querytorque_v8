You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Estimate May 2000 cross-channel demand from high-value store customers by summing catalog and web sales for items that were frequently sold in stores during 2000-2003. All joins are INNER (intersection) - rows must match across all joined tables. Aggregation uses only SUM and COUNT which are duplicate-insensitive, but HAVING COUNT(*) > 4 must be preserved. Filter dependencies: main query filters to d_year=2000 AND d_moy=5; CTEs filter to d_year IN (2000,2001,2002,2003); customer joins use c_customer_sk across all tables.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Grouping by (itemdesc, item_sk, date, customer_sk) may produce many groups (up to 13.8M)
- Must preserve HAVING cnt > 4 after initial aggregation

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do NOT convert IN subqueries to materialized CTEs if they're used as filters - keep as SEMI JOIN
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each has WHERE clause
3. pushdown (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When splitting CTEs, eliminate the original unfiltered version

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, sales in same order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must include all columns referenced downstream
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, d_moy=5, year range 2000-2003, 95/100.0 threshold
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows and ordering
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Predicates not pushed from main query into CTEs (EXPLAIN shows best_ss_customer scans ALL store_sales time, not just 2000-2003)
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned 4 times with overlapping date filters (EXPLAIN shows separate SEQ_SCAN nodes)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple aggregations into one scan with pre-aggregation. Ignore CASE WHEN labeling - we use GROUP BY on all needed dimensions.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply single scan with multiple aggregations concept. Ignore the bucket limit - we have 2 aggregations (cnt and customer_daily_sales).
- pushdown: Apply consolidation of store_sales scans. Ensure we compute both frequent items and customer aggregates in same pass.

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
