You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: For manager_id=1 items sold in December 2002, summarize store extended sales by brand and return brands ranked by descending revenue. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics), requiring matches across all three tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-safe, but join order must preserve correct multiplicities for revenue calculation. The d_moy=12 and d_year=2002 filters are interdependent (both must match), while i_manager_id=1 is independent but must be preserved.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- BETWEEN may be less selective than exact join if date_dim has gaps in surrogate key sequence
  - Must ensure BETWEEN includes all dates for December 2002 (should match EXPLAIN's range 2450816-2452642)
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.5x on q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and joined store_sales to date CTE before 3-way fact table join, preventing optimizer reordering
   RULE: This query has only one fact table, so pre-joining with date CTE is safe
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.85x on q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead without selectivity benefit
   RULE: Ensure every dimension CTE has WHERE clause (date_dim and item both have filters)
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline query <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query's baseline is 256ms > 100ms threshold, CTE overhead acceptable

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output d_year, brand_id, brand, ext_price ordered by d_year, ext_price desc, brand_id
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced by downstream queries (join keys, group by columns, aggregates)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manager_id=1, d_moy=12, d_year=2002 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical 100 rows with same ordering
- ENGINE_GAP_CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date_dim and item predicates pushed into scans but not into store_sales scan - fact table scanned entirely then filtered via joins

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 52 in stream 0 using template query52.tpl
select dt.d_year
 	,item.i_brand_id brand_id
 	,item.i_brand brand
 	,sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
 from date_dim dt
     ,store_sales
     ,item
 where dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
    and store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
    and item.i_manager_id = 1
    and dt.d_moy=12
    and dt.d_year=2002
 group by dt.d_year
 	,item.i_brand
 	,item.i_brand_id
 order by dt.d_year
 	,ext_price desc
 	,brand_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 52 in stream 0 using template query52.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `d_year`
  2. `brand_id`
  3. `brand`
  4. `ext_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with date and item, filter to d_year=2002/d_moy=12 and manager 1, aggregate by brand id/name, and order by highest ext_price.
    ├── SCAN (date_dim AS dt (join), store_sales (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (item.i_manager_id = 1)
    ├── FILTER (dt.d_moy = 12)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (dt.d_year ASC, ext_price DESC, brand_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (d_year, brand_id, brand, ext_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
