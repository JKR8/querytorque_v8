You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare item return quantities across store, catalog, and web channels for weeks containing three reference dates in 2001, reporting each channel's deviation from the cross-channel average. All three CTEs must match on item_id (INNER JOIN intersection). Only SUM aggregates are used, with no FILTER clauses or window functions. The date filter (weeks containing 2001-06-06, 2001-09-02, 2001-11-11) is identical across all three channels and must be preserved exactly.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL of three large tables may increase memory/IO.
- Pivoting via MAX(CASE) requires ensuring one row per (item_id, channel) which GROUP BY guarantees.
- Must preserve all three channels even if some items missing in a channel (INNER JOIN in main query will filter out items not present in all three channels).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: This query is 79ms - borderline. Ensure date CTE is small (<100 rows) and referenced multiple times.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query is 79ms - may still benefit but keep CTE chain minimal.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep joins sequential.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 8 output columns exactly as named.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream joins (item_id, return quantities).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep date literals '2001-06-06','2001-09-02','2001-11-11' unchanged.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match original exactly (same rows, order, columns).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each CTE independently computes same date filter (21 rows) - evident from 9 date_dim scans in EXPLAIN.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 9 times, item scanned 3 times - opportunity to reduce.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply the pattern of extracting shared dimension filters (date) into a common CTE. Ignore the promotion/item filters (not present).
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the pattern of consolidating multiple fact table scans into a single UNION ALL with a channel discriminator, then conditional aggregation. Ignore the CASE WHEN aggregation inside a single scan (here we have separate tables, so UNION ALL is required).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `item_id`
  2. `sr_item_qty`
  3. `sr_dev`
  4. `cr_item_qty`
  5. `cr_dev`
  6. `wr_item_qty`
  7. `wr_dev`
  8. `average`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
