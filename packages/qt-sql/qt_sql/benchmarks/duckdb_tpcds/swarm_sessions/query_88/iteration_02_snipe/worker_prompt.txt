You are a senior SQL optimization architect for DuckDB v1.4.3. You have FULL FREEDOM to design your own approach — you are NOT constrained to any specific logical tree topology or CTE structure. Your job: diagnose WHY previous workers failed to reach 2.0x, identify unexplored optimization angles, and produce an optimized SQL rewrite that reaches the target.

Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — guards prevent silent breakage. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from output.

## Target: >=2.0x speedup

Your target is >=2.0x speedup on this query. This is the bar. Anything below 2.0x is a miss.

## PREVIOUS RETRY ATTEMPT — Learn from this

Your previous retry achieved **0.0x** against a target of **2.0x**.
**Error**: Original query execution failed: Catalog Error: Table with name store_sales does not exist!
Did you mean "sqlite_master"?

LINE 1: SELECT * FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS h8_30_to_9 FROM store_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, store WHERE...
                                                          ^
**Strategy**: retry_1

Diagnose why this approach fell short and try a fundamentally different angle.

## Previous Optimization Attempts
Target: **>=2.0x** | 5 workers tried | none reached target

### W3: Union Consolidation with Single Pass Aggregation (Alternative) → 1.0x ★ BEST [PASS, below target (1.0x)]
- **Examples**: union_cte_split, single_pass_aggregation
- **Approach**: For union_cte_split: We are using UNION ALL to combine the time slices, but note
- **Optimized SQL:**

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count store sales by consecutive half-hour windows from 8:30 to 12:30 at store "ese" for households matching specific dependent/vehicle constraints. The query uses INNER JOINs (intersection) between store_sales, time_dim, store, and household_demographics. Aggregation uses COUNT(*), which is safe for consolidation via conditional aggregation. The time filters are mutually exclusive, so the counts are independent.

## Bottleneck Diagnosis

The query is scan-bound: 8 sequential scans of the entire store_sales table (345.6M rows each) dominate the runtime (230ms each, total ~1840ms). The joins and aggregations are fast (each subquery completes in ~1-2ms after the scan). The optimizer already pushes predicates into dimension scans (time_dim, store, household_demographics) but cannot push the time slice predicates into a single store_sales scan because they are in separate subqueries. The logical-tree cost percentages are misleading because they show each scan as 10% of the total, but the total is 800% of the base time (8 scans).

## Engine Profile

*This is field intelligence gathered from 88 TPC-DS queries at SF1-SF10. Use it to guide your analysis but apply your own judgment — every query is different. Add to this knowledge if you observe something new.*

### Optimizer Strengths (DO NOT fight these)
- **INTRA_SCAN_PREDICATE_PUSHDOWN**: Pushes WHERE filters directly into SEQ_SCAN. Single-table predicates are applied at scan time, zero overhead.
- **SAME_COLUMN_OR**: OR on the SAME column (e.g., t_hour BETWEEN 8 AND 11 OR t_hour BETWEEN 16 AND 17) is handled in a single scan with range checks.
- **HASH_JOIN_SELECTION**: Selects hash joins automatically. Join ordering is generally sound for 2-4 table joins.
- **CTE_INLINING**: CTEs referenced once are typically inlined (treated as subquery). Multi-referenced CTEs may be materialized.
- **COLUMNAR_PROJECTION**: Only reads columns actually referenced. Unused columns have zero I/O cost.
- **PARALLEL_AGGREGATION**: Scans and aggregations parallelized across threads. PERFECT_HASH_GROUP_BY is highly efficient.
- **EXISTS_SEMI_JOIN**: EXISTS/NOT EXISTS uses semi-join with early termination — stops after first match per outer row.

### Optimizer Gaps (opportunities)
- **CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS**: Cannot push predicates from the outer query backward into CTE definitions.
  Opportunity: Move selective predicates INTO the CTE definition. Pre-filter dimensions/facts before they get materialized.
    + Q6/Q11: 4.00x — date filter moved into CTE
    + Q63: 3.77x — pre-joined filtered dates with fact table before other dims
    + Q93: 2.97x — dimension filter applied before LEFT JOIN chain
- **REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION**: Cannot detect when the same fact table is scanned N times with similar filters across subquery boundaries.
  Opportunity: Consolidate N subqueries on the same table into 1 scan with CASE WHEN / FILTER() inside aggregates.
    + Q88: 6.28x — 8 time-bucket subqueries consolidated into 1 scan with 8 CASE branches
    + Q9: 4.47x — 15 separate store_sales scans consolidated into 1 scan with 5 CASE buckets
- **CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS**: Cannot automatically decorrelate correlated aggregate subqueries into GROUP BY + JOIN.
  Opportunity: Convert correlated WHERE to CTE with GROUP BY on the correlation column, then JOIN back.
    + Q1: 2.92x — correlated AVG with store_sk correlation converted to GROUP BY store_sk + JOIN
- **CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION**: Cannot decompose OR conditions that span DIFFERENT columns into independent targeted scans.
  Opportunity: Split cross-column ORs into UNION ALL branches, each with a targeted single-column filter.
    + Q88: 6.28x — 8 time-bucket subqueries with distinct hour ranges (distinct access paths)
    + Q15: 3.17x — (zip OR state OR price) split to 3 targeted branches
    + Q10: 1.49x, Q45: 1.35x, Q41: 1.89x
- **LEFT_JOIN_FILTER_ORDER_RIGIDITY**: Cannot reorder LEFT JOINs to apply selective dimension filters before expensive fact table joins.
  Opportunity: Pre-filter the selective dimension into a CTE, then use the filtered result as the JOIN partner.
    + Q93: 2.97x — filtered reason dimension FIRST, then LEFT JOIN to returns then fact
    + Q80: 1.40x — dimension isolation before fact join
- **UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION**: When a UNION ALL CTE is self-joined N times with each join filtering to a different discriminator, the optimizer materializes the full UNION once and probes it N times, discarding most rows each time.
  Opportunity: Split the UNION ALL into N separate CTEs (one per discriminator value).
    + Q74: 1.36x — UNION of store/web sales split into separate year-partitioned CTEs

### 5. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

## Correctness Invariants (HARD STOPS — non-negotiable)

These 4 constraints are absolute. Even with full creative freedom, you may NEVER violate these:

- **COMPLETE_OUTPUT**: The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
- **CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**: CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.
- **LITERAL_PRESERVATION**: CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.
- **SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**: The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Aggregation Semantics Check (HARD STOP)

- STDDEV_SAMP/VARIANCE are grouping-sensitive — changing group membership changes the result.
- AVG and STDDEV are NOT duplicate-safe.
- FILTER over a combined group != separate per-group computation.
- Verify aggregation equivalence for ANY proposed restructuring.

## Regression Warnings

### regression_q25_date_cte_isolate: date_cte_isolate on q25 (0.5x)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not pre-filter and materialize fact tables when the query has 3+ fact table joins. The optimizer needs freedom to reorder multi-way fact joins and push filters across them.
**Mechanism:** Pre-filtered and joined store_sales to date CTE BEFORE the 3-way fact table join (store_sales <- store_returns <- catalog_sales). By materializing the date-filtered store_sales early, the optimizer loses the ability to push filters across the multi-way fact join and reorder joins optimally.

### regression_q90_materialize_cte: materialize_cte on q90 (0.59x)
**Anti-pattern:** Never convert OR conditions on the SAME column (e.g., range conditions on t_hour) into UNION ALL. The optimizer already handles same-column ORs as a single scan. UNION ALL only helps when branches access fundamentally different tables or columns.
**Mechanism:** Split a simple OR condition (t_hour BETWEEN 10 AND 11 OR t_hour BETWEEN 16 AND 17) into UNION ALL of two separate web_sales scans. This doubles the fact table scan. DuckDB handles same-column OR ranges efficiently in a single scan — the UNION ALL adds materialization overhead with zero selectivity benefit.

### regression_q31_pushdown: pushdown on q31 (0.49x)
**Anti-pattern:** When creating filtered versions of existing CTEs, always REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs. Keeping both causes redundant materialization and 1000x+ cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
**Mechanism:** Created both filtered (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) AND original (ss, ws) versions of the same aggregations. The query does a 6-way self-join matching quarterly patterns (Q1->Q2->Q3). Duplicate CTEs doubled materialization and confused the optimizer's cardinality estimates for the multi-self-join.

## Your Task — Self-Directed Retry

Work through these 3 steps in a `<reasoning>` block, then output your optimized SQL:

1. **DIAGNOSE**: Why did the best worker achieve 1.0x instead of the 2.0x target? What do the EXPLAIN plans reveal about the actual execution bottleneck?
2. **IDENTIFY**: What optimization angles are still unexplored? What did the empirical results reveal that couldn't have been known before seeing the execution plans?
3. **REWRITE**: Produce optimized SQL that exploits the angles you identified. You may build on the best foundation or start fresh.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Verify output schema matches the Column Completeness Contract (same columns, same names, same order).
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Correctness Invariants` (including join/null behavior).
- Verify aggregation equivalence: same rows participate in each group, same aggregate semantics.
- Preserve all literals exactly (numbers, strings, date values).
- Apply `Hazard Flags` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
