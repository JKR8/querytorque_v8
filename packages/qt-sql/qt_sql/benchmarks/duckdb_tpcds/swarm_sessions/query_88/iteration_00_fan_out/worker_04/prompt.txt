You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count store sales in eight consecutive half-hour windows from 8:30-12:30 at store "ese" for households matching three specific dependent/vehicle count combinations. Joins are INNER (all four tables must match). Aggregation is COUNT(*), which is duplicate-safe and grouping-insensitive. Time window filters depend on time_dim joins; store filter depends on store join; household filters depend on household_demographics join.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- GROUP BY window_id changes aggregation grouping but each window is independent in original query (safe).
- MAX pivot is safe because each window_id has exactly one row.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combines scan consolidation with GROUP BY + pivot instead of conditional aggregation)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (observed regression 0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS subqueries to materialized CTEs (query has no EXISTS).
2. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column ORs into UNION ALL doubled fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split household_demographics OR (optimizer already handles).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query must output 8 columns (h8_30_to_9 through h12_to_12_30).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_sold_time_sk, ss_hdemo_sk, ss_store_sk for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Preserve exact values: store name 'ese', hour=8/9/10/11/12, minute thresholds 30, household condition values (-1,4,3, +2).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce identical 8 counts.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows 8 store_sales scans at ~230ms each.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Time predicates (t_hour, t_minute) not pushed into store_sales scan.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple scans into one GROUP BY with discriminator column. Ignore the conditional aggregation (using GROUP BY + pivot instead).
  union_cte_split: Apply splitting by discriminator (window_id) but consolidate into single scan. Ignore the UNION ALL aspect (use GROUP BY).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute eight independent time-slice counts under identical household/store filters and return them in one cross-joined row for side-by-side comparison.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, store)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_hour = 8)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_minute >= 30)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
