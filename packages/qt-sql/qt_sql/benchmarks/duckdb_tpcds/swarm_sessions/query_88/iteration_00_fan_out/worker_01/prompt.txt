You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count store sales in eight consecutive half-hour windows from 8:30-12:30 at store "ese" for households matching three specific dependent/vehicle count combinations. Joins are INNER (all four tables must match). Aggregation is COUNT(*), which is duplicate-safe and grouping-insensitive. Time window filters depend on time_dim joins; store filter depends on store join; household filters depend on household_demographics join.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure time window conditions are exactly as original (8 windows, exact hour/minute boundaries).
- Avoid cross-joining dimension CTEs before fact join (cartesian explosion).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (observed regression 0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS subqueries to materialized CTEs (query has no EXISTS).
2. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column ORs into UNION ALL doubled fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split household_demographics OR (optimizer already handles).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query must output 8 columns (h8_30_to_9 through h12_to_12_30).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_sold_time_sk, ss_hdemo_sk, ss_store_sk for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Preserve exact values: store name 'ese', hour=8/9/10/11/12, minute thresholds 30, household condition values (-1,4,3, +2).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce identical 8 counts.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows 8 store_sales scans at ~230ms each.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Time predicates (t_hour, t_minute) not pushed into store_sales scan.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the pattern of consolidating 8 repeated fact scans into one scan with CASE WHEN window labeling. Ignore the channel-specific logic (this query uses time windows not channels).
  single_pass_aggregation: Apply conditional aggregation with CASE inside COUNT. Ignore any decorrelation aspects.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute eight independent time-slice counts under identical household/store filters and return them in one cross-joined row for side-by-side comparison.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, store)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_hour = 8)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_minute >= 30)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
