You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute average quantity, average sales metrics, and total wholesale cost for 2001 U.S. store sales matching specific demographic/price bands (3 scenarios) AND address/profit bands (3 scenarios). All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches on all dimension tables. Aggregates (AVG, SUM) are duplicate-sensitive, but joins are on foreign keys so no duplication introduced. The two OR groups are independent but both must be satisfied (AND between groups), creating a 3x3 combinatorial filter.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- fact_base CTE may be large (~5.3M rows) and materialized.
  - Each branch re-joins store, customer_demographics, household_demographics, potentially expensive.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION ALL, doubling fact scans without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Only split when OR conditions are on different columns/tables (true here). Limit to 3 branches.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query has 6745ms baseline, acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly: avg(ss_quantity), avg(ss_ext_sales_price), avg(ss_ext_wholesale_cost), sum(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: surrogate keys for joins (ss_store_sk, ss_sold_date_sk, etc.) and the four aggregated columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All literal values (e.g., 'D', 'Unknown', 100.00, 'SD', 'United States', 2001) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical result set (1 row, 4 aggregates).
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: EXPLAIN shows complex FILTER node after joins; OR spans cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, ss_sales_price, hd_dep_count, ca_state, ss_net_profit.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs in original, but creating CTEs could push filters earlier.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Q15 provides UNION ALL splitting; adapt by splitting demographic scenarios. Q63 provides pre-joining filtered dimensions (date, address) with fact; adapt by creating fact_base CTE. Q35 provides shared dimension CTE (date) for multiple branches; adapt by sharing date_cte and addr_cte across branches.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `AVG(ss_quantity)`
  2. `AVG(ss_ext_sales_price)`
  3. `AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)`
  4. `SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter store-sales rows by three OR-connected household/demographic/price scenarios and three OR-connected U.S. state/net-profit scenarios, then return overall aggregate statistics across all qualifying rows.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2001)
    └── OUTPUT (AVG(ss_quantity), AVG(ss_ext_sales_price), AVG(ss_ext_wholesale_cost), SUM(ss_ext_wholesale_cost))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
