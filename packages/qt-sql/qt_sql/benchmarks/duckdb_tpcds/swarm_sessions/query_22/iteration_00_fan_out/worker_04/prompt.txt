You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute average inventory on-hand quantity for dates in month sequence 1188-1199, aggregated hierarchically from product name down to category via ROLLUP. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all three tables. AVG is duplicate-sensitive, but inventory→item is one-to-one via primary key, allowing safe aggregation pushdown. The date filter (d_month_seq) must remain applied before aggregation to ensure correct temporal scope.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must handle division by zero (total_cnt will never be zero due to COUNT aggregation)
- NULL placement in rolled-up columns must match original ROLLUP
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (aggregate_pushdown + rollup_to_union_windowing)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline query <50ms; CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 43s, so CTE overhead negligible - proceed
3. rollup_to_union_windowing (potential regression):
   CAUSE: ROLLUP efficient when dimensions small and groups few; explicit UNION may add overhead
   RULE: Verify 204K groups is large enough to benefit from per-level optimization

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, qoh in same order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (inv_item_sk, i_* columns, inv_quantity_on_hand)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with identical qoh values and NULL placement in rollup
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter is pushed but item has no filter; opportunity to pre-filter item via fact table
- AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN: Aggregation processes 26.5M rows but could be pushed before item join (one-to-one relationship)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply the consolidation principle but for aggregation pushdown. Ignore CASE WHEN.
- rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply UNION ALL of grouping levels, but compute sum/cnt in each branch then compute average once. Adapt to use sum/cnt aggregates.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply dimension pre-filtering, but only date is filtered; item join happens after aggregation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

```

### 2. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;

```

### 3. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,

        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_product_name`
  2. `i_brand`
  3. `i_class`
  4. `i_category`
  5. `qoh`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join inventory with date and item, restrict to the 12-month window, aggregate average on-hand quantity under a product hierarchy ROLLUP, and sort by qoh plus product attributes.
    ├── SCAN (inventory, date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (qoh ASC, i_product_name ASC, i_brand ASC, i_class ASC, i_category ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, qoh)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
