You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute average inventory on-hand quantity for dates in month sequence 1188-1199, aggregated hierarchically from product name down to category via ROLLUP. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all three tables. AVG is duplicate-sensitive, but inventory→item is one-to-one via primary key, allowing safe aggregation pushdown. The date filter (d_month_seq) must remain applied before aggregation to ensure correct temporal scope.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL branches all scan the same 26.5M-row CTE; ensure it's materialized once, not re-executed per branch
- NULL placement must match ROLLUP semantics (NULL in rolled-up columns)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline query <50ms; CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 43s, so CTE overhead negligible - proceed
3. rollup_to_union_windowing (potential regression):
   CAUSE: ROLLUP efficient when dimensions small and groups few; explicit UNION may add overhead
   RULE: Verify 204K groups is large enough to benefit from per-level optimization

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, qoh in same order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (inv_item_sk, i_* columns, inv_quantity_on_hand)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with identical qoh values and NULL placement in rollup
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter is pushed but item has no filter; opportunity to pre-filter item via fact table
- AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN: Aggregation processes 26.5M rows but could be pushed before item join (one-to-one relationship)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply exact pattern - replace ROLLUP with explicit UNION ALL branches per grouping level. Ignore window function aspect (ranking not needed).
- union_cte_split: Apply splitting of a generic CTE into specialized ones, but here we split the ROLLUP into separate aggregation queries. Ignore year filter specialization.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
```
[item_sums]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk GROUP BY ss_item_sk
```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```
[detailed]:
```sql
SELECT net_profit / sales_price AS gross_margin, i_category, i_class, 0 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[category_summary]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, i_category, NULL AS i_class, 1 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0 GROUP BY i_category
```
[grand_total]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, NULL AS i_category, NULL AS i_class, 2 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[all_levels]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM detailed UNION ALL SELECT * FROM category_summary UNION ALL SELECT * FROM grand_total
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy < 2 THEN RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ORDER BY gross_margin ASC) ELSE 1 END AS rank_within_parent FROM all_levels ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100
```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_product_name`
  2. `i_brand`
  3. `i_class`
  4. `i_category`
  5. `qoh`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join inventory with date and item, restrict to the 12-month window, aggregate average on-hand quantity under a product hierarchy ROLLUP, and sort by qoh plus product attributes.
    ├── SCAN (inventory, date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1188 AND 1188 + 11)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (qoh ASC, i_product_name ASC, i_brand ASC, i_class ASC, i_category ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_product_name, i_brand, i_class, i_category, qoh)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
