You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count distinct customer-name/date combinations that occur in all three sales channels within month sequence 1183-1194. INTERSECT requires exact matching of all three columns (including NULLs). All joins are INNER, requiring matches in all joined tables. No aggregation function traps (only COUNT(*)). The d_month_seq filter applies identically to all three channels; moving it earlier preserves semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL of large fact tables (9.6M rows) may be more expensive than separate processing.
  - COUNT(DISTINCT channel) must equal 3, not just presence flags.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (regression_q16: 0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert INTERSECT to materialized CTE that computes full distinct sets if EXISTS alternative exists.
2. date_cte_isolate (regression_q25: 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Keep fact table joins together; only pre-filter dimensions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output single column count(*).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date, and join keys.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: d_month_seq values 1183 and 1183+11 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: INTERSECT must produce same set as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows 3 separate date_dim scans (0.2ms each) with same filter.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows 3 separate customer scans (500K rows each, ~10ms each).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply: Consolidate three channel scans into UNION ALL, then single GROUP BY with COUNT(DISTINCT channel).
  Ignore: The example uses CASE aggregation for different buckets; we use COUNT(DISTINCT channel).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `COUNT(*)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Build distinct customer/date sets per channel over the 12-month sequence, intersect the three sets, and return the final count of shared customer shopping dates.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1183 AND 1183 + 11)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json

  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",

```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
