You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For 2002 widow customers with buy-potential 501-1000, summarize catalog order counts by item/warehouse/week split into promo vs non-promo where inventory was below sold quantity and ship date lag exceeded 5 days. INNER JOINs require all dimension matches; LEFT JOINs to promotion and catalog_returns preserve catalog_sales rows regardless of match. Aggregation uses COUNT(*) and SUM of CASE flags which are duplicate-sensitive if joins change row multiplicity. Filter dependencies: d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5 creates correlation between the two date_dim aliases; d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq links inventory date to sales date.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- date_triplet CTE may produce Cartesian product between d1 and d3 (102K rows) times d2 matches; could be large.
- Must ensure inv_date_sk from date_triplet matches inventory.inv_date_sk exactly.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (0.77x on Q72):
   CAUSE: Forced suboptimal join ordering on complex multi-table query with 5+ joins.
   RULE: Limit to 2 cascading fact-table CTE chains; allow optimizer freedom for remaining joins.
2. multi_dimension_prefetch (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead.
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause that reduces rows.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; join dimensions sequentially to fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt ordered by total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq with LIMIT 100.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: join keys (cs_item_sk, cs_order_number, etc.), filter columns (d_date, cs_quantity), and output columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: hd_buy_potential = '501-1000', d1.d_year = 2002, cd_marital_status = 'W', and numeric 5 in date arithmetic.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows, counts, and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Predicate inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity cannot be pushed into inventory scan (EXPLAIN shows it's applied as join condition after scanning 2.5M rows).
- MULTI_DATE_RANGE_CTE_NEEDED: Query uses date_dim three times with different filters; optimizer already scans each separately but could benefit from pre-computed date relationships.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- multi_date_range_cte: Apply separate CTEs for each date alias but combine into a single date_triplet CTE that pre-joins d1, d2, d3 with their relationships; ignore that d2 is not filtered (include all d2 rows matching d_week_seq).
- date_cte_isolate: Extract date filtering into CTE; but combine all three dates into one CTE due to correlations.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Not applicable (no multi-channel); ignore.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

### 2. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_desc`
  2. `w_warehouse_name`
  3. `d_week_seq`
  4. `no_promo`
  5. `promo`
  6. `total_cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales with inventory, warehouse, item, demographics, date dimensions, optional promotion, and optional returns; apply stockout and ship-lag conditions; then count promo/non-promo rows per item/warehouse/week.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, inventory (join), warehouse (join), item (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), promotion (join), catalog_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_week_seq = d2.d_week_seq)
    ├── FILTER (inv_quantity_on_hand < cs_quantity)
    ├── FILTER (d3.d_date > d1.d_date + 5)
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (total_cnt DESC, i_item_desc ASC, w_warehouse_name ASC, d1.d_week_seq ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_desc, w_warehouse_name, d_week_seq, no_promo, promo, total_cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
