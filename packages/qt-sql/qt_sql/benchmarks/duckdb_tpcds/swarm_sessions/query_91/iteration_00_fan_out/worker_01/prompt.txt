You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For November 2001 catalog returns, aggregate net loss by call center for customers in GMT offset -6 with specific marital/education and household buy-potential profiles. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches across all seven tables. The SUM(cr_net_loss) is duplicate-sensitive; joins must preserve the same multiplicity between customer and catalog_returns as the original foreign-key relationships. The OR filter on customer_demographics (two column-pair combinations) must not be simplified; both branches contribute to the same aggregated groups.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk of doubling customer and catalog_returns joins if not careful—ensure each branch joins independently but same tables.
- Must include cd_marital_status, cd_education_status in outputs for GROUP BY.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact table scans.
   RULE: Only split OR on different columns/tables. This query's OR is on different column pairs (marital+education) within same table—acceptable.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them through the fact or bridging table (customer). This query joins dimensions via customer, safe.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Query outputs cc_call_center_id, cc_name, cc_manager, sum(cr_net_loss). Must preserve column aliases and ordering.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: join keys (surrogate keys), grouping columns (cd_marital_status, cd_education_status), and aggregated columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must copy exact literal values: d_year=2001, d_moy=11, cd_marital_status='M'/'W', cd_education_status='Unknown'/'Advanced Degree', hd_buy_potential like '1001-5000%', ca_gmt_offset=-6.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 21 rows ordered by sum(cr_net_loss) desc.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR condition on different column pairs (marital+education) prevents optimal scan path. EXPLAIN shows single FILTER node with complex expression.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Predicate on customer_demographics is applied after scanning 1.9M rows; pre-filtering into CTE could reduce scan size.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- or_to_union: Apply the split of OR into two branches with focused predicates on customer_demographics. Ignore the self-join aspect (Q15 had three branches).
- composite_decorrelate_union: Ignore the decorrelation of EXISTS; adapt the UNION of key sets after pre-filtering dimensions.
- union_cte_split: Adapt splitting a generic CTE into specialized ones; here split customer_demographics into two CTEs by filter.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

### 2. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
  ca_state,
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_dep_count,
  count(*) cnt1,
  max(cd_dep_count),
  sum(cd_dep_count),
  max(cd_dep_count),
  cd_dep_employed_count,
  count(*) cnt2,
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  sum(cd_dep_employed_count),
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  cd_dep_college_count,
  count(*) cnt3,
  max(cd_dep_college_count),
  sum(cd_dep_college_count),
  max(cd_dep_college_count)

          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                d_year = 2001 and
                d_qoy < 4) and
   (exists (select *

                  ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4) or 
    exists (select * 
            from catalog_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk and
                  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and

```

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Call_Center`
  2. `Call_Center_Name`
  3. `Manager`
  4. `Returns_Loss`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog returns to call center, date, and customer demographic/address dimensions; apply month/year and profile filters; group by call center attributes (and demographic grouping columns); and order by highest return loss.
    ├── SCAN (call_center, catalog_returns (join), date_dim (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join))
    ├── JOIN (cr_call_center_sk = cc_call_center_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+4 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2001)
    ├── FILTER (d_moy = 11)
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUM(cr_net_loss) DESC)
    └── OUTPUT (Call_Center, Call_Center_Name, Manager, Returns_Loss)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
