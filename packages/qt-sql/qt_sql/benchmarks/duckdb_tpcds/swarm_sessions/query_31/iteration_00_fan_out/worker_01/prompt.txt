You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare county-level quarter-over-quarter growth in 2000 web sales versus store sales, returning counties where web growth beats store growth from Q1->Q2 and again from Q2->Q3. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching county and quarter/year. Aggregates are SUMs, safe for restructuring. Filter dependencies: quarter and year filters (d_qoy, d_year) must be preserved; growth ratio filters must compare web to store and must handle division by zero via NULL.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must remove original ss and ws CTEs completely to avoid regression.
- Ensure each quarter-specific CTE includes the date_filter join to get d_qoy filter.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q31_pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) but kept original (ss, ws) versions, causing redundant materialization and cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by quarter, REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs entirely.
2. regression_q74_pushdown (0.68x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION CTE and specialized year-specific CTEs, causing redundant computation.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by discriminator (year/quarter), replace the original CTE — do not keep both.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly the six columns in the original SELECT, ordered by web_q1_q2_increase.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ca_county, d_year, d_qoy, store_sales/web_sales.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_year=2000, d_qoy values 1,2,3, and NULL handling in CASE.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 307 rows with same ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS — CTEs are scanned multiple times with different quarter filters; predicates not pushed into CTE definition.
- ENGINE_GAP: REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION — date_dim and customer_address scanned twice (once per channel).
- ENGINE_GAP: UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION — generic CTE self-joined three times with different quarter filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Apply splitting of generic CTE (ss, ws) into quarter-specific CTEs. Ignore the year splitting aspect — we only have one year (2000).
- multi_date_range_cte: Apply separate date filtering per quarter alias (d1, d2, d3) but we use a single date_filter CTE with a WHERE clause per quarter branch. Ignore the fact that we don't create separate date CTEs for each quarter — we filter inside each channel CTE.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

### 2. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_county`
  2. `d_year`
  3. `web_q1_q2_increase`
  4. `store_q1_q2_increase`
  5. `web_q2_q3_increase`
  6. `store_q2_q3_increase`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] ss  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store extended sales by county, quarter, and year from store_sales with customer address geography.
│   ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim (join), customer_address (join))
│   ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ss_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
