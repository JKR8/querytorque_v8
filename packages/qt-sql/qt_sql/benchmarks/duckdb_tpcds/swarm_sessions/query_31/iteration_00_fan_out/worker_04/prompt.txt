You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare county-level quarter-over-quarter growth in 2000 web sales versus store sales, returning counties where web growth beats store growth from Q1->Q2 and again from Q2->Q3. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching county and quarter/year. Aggregates are SUMs, safe for restructuring. Filter dependencies: quarter and year filters (d_qoy, d_year) must be preserved; growth ratio filters must compare web to store and must handle division by zero via NULL.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- This creates six CTEs, each scanning the fact table with a different quarter filter. This may increase total fact table scan cost if the optimizer cannot push the quarter filter into the scan (but it should via date_filter). However, each fact table scan will be smaller because it's filtered to one quarter.
- Must ensure the date_filter CTE is referenced by all six CTEs and is not materialized multiple times.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q31_pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) but kept original (ss, ws) versions, causing redundant materialization and cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by quarter, REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs entirely.
2. regression_q74_pushdown (0.68x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION CTE and specialized year-specific CTEs, causing redundant computation.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by discriminator (year/quarter), replace the original CTE — do not keep both.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly the six columns in the original SELECT, ordered by web_q1_q2_increase.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ca_county, d_year, d_qoy, store_sales/web_sales.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_year=2000, d_qoy values 1,2,3, and NULL handling in CASE.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 307 rows with same ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS — CTEs are scanned multiple times with different quarter filters; predicates not pushed into CTE definition.
- ENGINE_GAP: REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION — date_dim and customer_address scanned twice (once per channel).
- ENGINE_GAP: UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION — generic CTE self-joined three times with different quarter filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Apply splitting by quarter to eliminate generic CTE self-joins. Ignore the year splitting — we focus on quarters.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply shared dimension CTEs (date_filter, addr_all) to reduce duplicate dimension scans. Ignore the fact that addr_all is unfiltered — it still reduces scans.
- multi_dimension_prefetch: Apply pre-filtering of multiple dimension tables (date and address) before joining with fact tables. Ignore the cross-join hazard — we join dimensions independently with fact tables.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

### 3. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Tuesday') then ss_sales_price else  null end) tue_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_day_name FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_store_id FROM store WHERE s_gmt_offset = -5
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales LIMIT 100
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_county`
  2. `d_year`
  3. `web_q1_q2_increase`
  4. `store_q1_q2_increase`
  5. `web_q2_q3_increase`
  6. `store_q2_q3_increase`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
