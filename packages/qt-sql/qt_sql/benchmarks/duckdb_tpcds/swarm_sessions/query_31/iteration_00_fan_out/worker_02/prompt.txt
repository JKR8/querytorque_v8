You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare county-level quarter-over-quarter growth in 2000 web sales versus store sales, returning counties where web growth beats store growth from Q1->Q2 and again from Q2->Q3. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching county and quarter/year. Aggregates are SUMs, safe for restructuring. Filter dependencies: quarter and year filters (d_qoy, d_year) must be preserved; growth ratio filters must compare web to store and must handle division by zero via NULL.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The addr_all CTE is unfiltered (750K rows). This may not reduce scan cost but reduces duplicate scans. Ensure it does not cause Cartesian explosion.
- The store_agg and web_agg CTEs are still generic (all quarters) and will be self-joined three times. This does not solve the quarter-filtering redundancy.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q31_pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) but kept original (ss, ws) versions, causing redundant materialization and cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by quarter, REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs entirely.
2. regression_q74_pushdown (0.68x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION CTE and specialized year-specific CTEs, causing redundant computation.
   RULE: When splitting a CTE by discriminator (year/quarter), replace the original CTE — do not keep both.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly the six columns in the original SELECT, ordered by web_q1_q2_increase.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ca_county, d_year, d_qoy, store_sales/web_sales.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_year=2000, d_qoy values 1,2,3, and NULL handling in CASE.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 307 rows with same ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS — CTEs are scanned multiple times with different quarter filters; predicates not pushed into CTE definition.
- ENGINE_GAP: REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION — date_dim and customer_address scanned twice (once per channel).
- ENGINE_GAP: UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION — generic CTE self-joined three times with different quarter filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply extracting shared date and address filters into CTEs referenced by both store and web aggregates. Ignore the fact that the original query already filters date_dim — we are just moving the filter into a shared CTE.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply pre-filtering of dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address) into CTEs before joining with fact tables. Ignore the cross-join hazard — we are not cross-joining multiple dimension CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_county`
  2. `d_year`
  3. `web_q1_q2_increase`
  4. `store_q1_q2_increase`
  5. `web_q2_q3_increase`
  6. `store_q2_q3_increase`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
