You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute February 2000 total sales per item (colors powder/green/cyan) across store, catalog, and web channels for addresses at GMT offset -6. INNER JOIN semantics require all dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item) to match for each sale row. Aggregation uses SUM, which is duplicate-safe, but the GROUP BY on i_item_id must be preserved after joins. The item color filter is applied via a semi-join subquery; rewriting must retain exact color values and GMT offset.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_dimensions -> ss_joined -> ss_agg
  filtered_dimensions -> cs_joined -> cs_agg
  filtered_dimensions -> ws_joined -> ws_agg
  (ss_agg, cs_agg, ws_agg) -> union_all -> main_agg -> order_limit
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_dimensions:
    FROM: date_dim, customer_address, item
    JOIN: CROSS JOIN (date_dim, customer_address, item) — but must filter each independently. Actually, we need to combine the three dimension filters without cross-joining. Better: create three separate CTEs and then cross join? That would cause Cartesian explosion. Instead, we can create a CTE that joins date_dim, customer_address, item? There are no join conditions between them. So we must create three CTEs and then join them in each fact join. That's similar to Worker 1. Let's adjust: filtered_dimensions will be a CTE that SELECTs d_date_sk, ca_address_sk, i_item_sk, i_item_id FROM date_dim, customer_address, item WHERE date filters AND customer filters AND item filters. This is a cross join of three small tables (29 * 110K * 3,234) which is huge. So this strategy is dangerous. Instead, we should keep the dimensions separate but share them across channels. That's what Worker 1 does. So for Worker 2, we should use the same three dimension CTEs as Worker 1 but structure the query differently: create a CTE that unions the fact tables with a channel discriminator, then join with the dimension CTEs. That's actually Worker 3. Let's reassign Worker 2 to a different strategy.

Revised Worker 2 strategy: **single_pass_aggregation adaptation** (but fact tables are separate). Instead, we can use a **union_all_consolidation** strategy: union the fact tables first, then join with filtered dimensions once, then aggregate.

Let's redesign Worker 2.

STRATEGY: union_all_consolidation
TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
  filtered_date -> filtered_customer -> filtered_item -> all_sales_joined -> sales_agg -> channel_agg -> main_agg -> order_limit
But note: the join keys are different per channel (ss_addr_sk vs cs_bill_addr_sk vs ws_bill_addr_sk). We need to handle that.

We'll create a CTE "all_sales" that unions the three fact tables with consistent column names.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The union of three large fact tables may be expensive if not reduced by dimensions first. But we join after union, which may cause a large intermediate union.
- Must ensure join keys are correctly mapped (addr_sk matches the appropriate column).
- The original query does per-channel aggregation before union, which reduces data. Our approach does aggregation after union, which may be heavier if the union produces many rows.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact tables.
2. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: Do not convert semi-join subqueries to materialized CTEs; keep as EXISTS or use semi-join.
3. pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs but kept original unfiltered CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When creating filtered CTEs, remove the original unfiltered CTEs.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id and total_sales ordered by total_sales, i_item_id LIMIT 100.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced by downstream joins (e.g., d_date_sk, ca_address_sk, i_item_sk, i_item_id).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: i_color in ('powder','green','cyan'), d_year=2000, d_moy=2, ca_gmt_offset=-6.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly the same rows as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date_dim scanned 3 times, customer_address 3 times, item 6 times — predicates not pushed across CTE boundaries.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: item table scanned 6 times (2 per channel) for the same color filter.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply the idea of extracting shared dimension filters; ignore the multiple channel CTEs (we use a single union).
- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate multiple fact table scans into a single union; ignore the CASE aggregation (we just union).
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Consolidate repeated scans of the same fact table? Not directly applicable because we have different tables, but the pattern of unifying fact sources applies.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `total_sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
