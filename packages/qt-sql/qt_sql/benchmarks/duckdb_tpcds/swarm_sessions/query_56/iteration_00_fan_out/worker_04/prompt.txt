You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute February 2000 total sales per item (colors powder/green/cyan) across store, catalog, and web channels for addresses at GMT offset -6. INNER JOIN semantics require all dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, item) to match for each sale row. Aggregation uses SUM, which is duplicate-safe, but the GROUP BY on i_item_id must be preserved after joins. The item color filter is applied via a semi-join subquery; rewriting must retain exact color values and GMT offset.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_date -> filtered_customer -> filtered_item -> ss_joined -> ss_agg (as before)
  ... similar for cs, ws.
  Then union and aggregate.
But this is similar to Worker 1. Let's try a novel combination: **single CTE for all filtered dimensions and fact pre-join**? That would cross-join dimensions, which is dangerous.

Alternative exploration: **use a materialized CTE for the item color filter and then use it as a semi-join without re-scanning item for the join**. The original query uses a semi-join for the color filter and then an inner join for item. We can combine these into a single join with a filtered item CTE. That's what we already do in Worker 1.

Another exploration: **use a lateral join to fetch item_id only for matching rows**? Not sure.

Given the time, let's assign Worker 4 a strategy that combines dimension CTEs with a union of fact tables and early aggregation pushdown (similar to Worker 2 but with per-channel aggregation preserved). This is a compound strategy.

STRATEGY: union_all_with_dimension_ctes_and_channel_aggregation
TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
  filtered_date, filtered_customer, filtered_item -> all_sales_joined -> sales_agg_by_channel -> channel_agg -> union_all -> main_agg -> order_limit
But we need to preserve the channel distinction for aggregation? Actually, the final aggregation is across channels, so per-channel aggregation is not needed if we group by item_id and channel? Wait, the original does per-channel aggregation, then sums across channels. If we group by item_id and channel, then sum across channels, that's equivalent to grouping by item_id only. So we can do a single aggregation by item_id. That's what Worker 2 does.

So for exploration, let's try a different compound: **use a single CTE that pre-joins all dimensions with each fact table separately, then unions the results**. That's essentially Worker 1.

Given the limited novel options, let's explore a strategy that uses a **temporary table** (not CTE) for filtered dimensions? But we must stay within SQL.

I'll assign Worker 4 to try a strategy that **pre-aggregates the fact tables by dimension keys before joining with dimensions**. This is aggregation pushdown.

STRATEGY: fact_pre_aggregation
TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
  ss_agg_by_keys -> join_with_dimensions -> ss_agg
  cs_agg_by_keys -> join_with_dimensions -> cs_agg
  ws_agg_by_keys -> join_with_dimensions -> ws_agg
  then union and final aggregate.
NODE_CONTRACTS:

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-aggregation on high-cardinality keys (item, date, address) may not reduce rows significantly.
- Must ensure that the pre-aggregation does not lose necessary granularity (it doesn't, because we group by the join keys).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy
</reasoning>

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact tables.
2. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: Do not convert semi-join subqueries to materialized CTEs; keep as EXISTS or use semi-join.
3. pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs but kept original unfiltered CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When creating filtered CTEs, remove the original unfiltered CTEs.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id and total_sales ordered by total_sales, i_item_id LIMIT 100.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced by downstream joins (e.g., d_date_sk, ca_address_sk, i_item_sk, i_item_id).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: i_color in ('powder','green','cyan'), d_year=2000, d_moy=2, ca_gmt_offset=-6.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly the same rows as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date_dim scanned 3 times, customer_address 3 times, item 6 times — predicates not pushed across CTE boundaries.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: item table scanned 6 times (2 per channel) for the same color filter.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply pre-aggregation on fact table before joining dimensions; ignore the CASE aggregation.
- prefetch_fact_join: Use dimension CTEs; ignore the fact that we pre-aggregate fact table.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Use filtered dimension CTEs; ignore the pre-aggregation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales

where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql

```

### 3. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:

```
[main_query]:
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `total_sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
