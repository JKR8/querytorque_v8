You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Profile customers in TX/VA/MI who made store purchases Jan-Mar 2000 but had no web or catalog purchases in same period. INNER JOIN semantics require all three base tables (customer, address, demographics) to match. EXISTS/NOT EXISTS are semi/anti joins with early termination—do NOT materialize full result sets. Aggregation uses COUNT(*) only, duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: date filter (d_year=2000, d_moy 1-3) must apply identically to all three channel subqueries; state filter applies before EXISTS checks.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- NOT IN may have NULL handling issues; ensure customer keys are non-NULL.
- Materializing distinct customer keys per channel may be larger than semi/anti join intermediate results.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combines date_cte_isolate with distinct key materialization and set operations)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (regression_q25_date_cte_isolate: 0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and materialized fact table before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Do NOT pre-join fact tables with date CTE if it forces join order; keep date CTE as dimension-only.
2. materialize_cte (regression_q16_semantic_rewrite: 0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS as semi/anti joins; do NOT materialize channel existence checks.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3 in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (customer keys, demographic columns, date keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, d_moy between 1 and 3, ca_state IN ('TX','VA','MI').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same rows as original query.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 3 times with same filter (EXPLAIN shows 3 separate FILTER nodes on date_dim).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times (opportunity to consolidate to 1 scan).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

composite_decorrelate_union: Extract shared date filter, create distinct customer key CTEs per channel, combine with set operations (NOT IN). Ignore the UNION aspect — Q35 used UNION for EXISTS with OR.
  multi_intersect_exists_cte: Use NOT IN instead of INTERSECT for anti-join. Ignore the cascading INTERSECT — Q14 had INTERSECT.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `cd_gender`
  2. `cd_marital_status`
  3. `cd_education_status`
  4. `cnt1`
  5. `cd_purchase_estimate`
  6. `cnt2`
  7. `cd_credit_rating`
  8. `cnt3`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join customer/address/demographics, enforce store-sales EXISTS and web/catalog NOT EXISTS constraints over the Jan-Mar 2000 window, then group and count by demographic dimensions.
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (ca_state IN ('TX', 'VA', 'MI'))
    ├── FILTER (EXISTS(SELECT * FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000 AND d_moy BETWEEN 1 AND 1 + 2))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_education_status ASC, cd_purchase_estimate ASC, cd_credit_rating ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, cnt1, cd_purchase_estimate, cnt2, cd_credit_rating, cnt3)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
