You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute store-sales revenue per item within a 30-day window starting 2002-05-20 for Sports, Music, and Shoes categories, then calculate each item's percentage contribution within its item class. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics) requiring matches in all three tables. The window function SUM(SUM(...)) OVER uses the same underlying aggregate as the main aggregation; any restructuring must preserve group membership for the window partition. The date filter depends only on date_dim; the category filter depends only on item; breaking these dependencies would change results.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-aggregation by (item, date) must preserve all necessary dimensions for later joins.
- Verify that SUM(daily_revenue) equals original SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) after joins.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 324ms (>100ms), so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially to fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price, itemrevenue, revenueratio in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (especially item attributes and join keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '2002-05-20', interval 30 DAY, categories 'Sports','Music','Shoes'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical 15K rows with same ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date filter not pushed into store_sales scan (345.6M rows scanned).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single fact table scan already; no consolidation opportunity.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of aggregation before joins; ignore the CASE WHEN branching (not needed).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_category`
  4. `i_class`
  5. `i_current_price`
  6. `itemrevenue`
  7. `revenueratio`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales to item and date, filter to the date window and target categories, aggregate revenue per item attributes, and compute class-level revenue share with a window partition on i_class.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_category IN ('Sports', 'Music', 'Shoes'))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-05-20' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_item_id ASC, i_item_desc ASC, revenueratio ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price, itemrevenue, revenueratio)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
