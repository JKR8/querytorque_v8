You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers with 1-5 store sale line items per ticket under specific household demographics (buy potential 501-1000 or Unknown, vehicle count > 0, dep/vehicle ratio > 1), date filters (day-of-month 1-2, years 2000-2002), and store county filters. INNER JOIN semantics require all dimension and customer matches. Aggregation uses COUNT(*) which is duplicate-sensitive if joins multiply rows, but foreign key joins should preserve row counts. Filter on cnt depends on complete grouping after all dimension filters are applied.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- EXISTS may force nested loop joins instead of hash joins
  - DuckDB may not optimize multiple correlated EXISTS efficiently
  - Semi-joins might not push predicates into store_sales scan
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combining EXISTS semi-joins with dimension pre-filtering for potential bloom-filter-like optimization)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs with each other; join each independently with fact table
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <50ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated
   RULE: Acceptable here (baseline 475ms > 100ms threshold)
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR conditions, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Do NOT split hd_buy_potential OR (same column)

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt ordered by cnt DESC, c_last_name ASC.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: All CTEs must include surrogate keys (d_date_sk, s_store_sk, hd_demo_sk) for joins and ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk for aggregation.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact filter values: d_dom 1-2, d_year 2000-2002, s_county list, hd_buy_potential values, hd_vehicle_count > 0, CASE expression.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical 15 rows with same ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows dimension filters applied after fact scan, not used to restrict it.
- DIMENSION_CTE_CROSS_JOIN_HAZARD: Multiple dimension CTEs must not be cross-joined before fact table.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

intersect_to_exists (Q14): Apply EXISTS pattern for filtering; ignore INTERSECT-specific aspects.
  decorrelate (Q1): Apply decorrelation pattern but in reverse - using correlated EXISTS for filtering instead of removing correlation.
  early_filter (Q11): Apply early filtering principle via EXISTS semi-joins.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

**AFTER (fast):**
[cross_items_flat]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_item_sk AS ss_item_sk FROM item i WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM store_sales, item iss, date_dim d1 WHERE ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND iss.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND iss.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND iss.i_category_id = i.i_category_id) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM catalog_sales, item ics, date_dim d2 WHERE cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk AND cs_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d2.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND ics.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND ics.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND ics.i_category_id = i.i_category_id) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales, item iws, date_dim d3 WHERE ws_item_sk = iws.i_item_sk AND ws_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND iws.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND iws.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND iws.i_category_id = i.i_category_id)
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE i_item_sk IN (SELECT ss_item_sk FROM cross_items_flat) ...
```

### 2. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 3. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `c_salutation`
  4. `c_preferred_cust_flag`
  5. `ss_ticket_number`
  6. `cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Count rows per ticket and customer for filtered store-sales transactions, keep counts between 1 and 5, join to customer, and return customer identity with ticket count ordered by highest count.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (cnt BETWEEN 1 AND 5)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cnt DESC, c_last_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
