You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Summarize 1998 warehouse monthly sales and net paid amounts (plus per-square-foot metrics) for shipments handled by carriers GREAT EASTERN or LATVIAN during a target time-of-day window, combining web and catalog channels. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all dimension tables. Aggregation uses SUM with CASE expressions, which are duplicate-safe. Filters on date_dim (d_year=1998), time_dim (t_time range), and ship_mode (sm_carrier IN) must be preserved in each channel branch; missing any breaks equivalence.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Aggregating by ws_warehouse_sk and d_year before joining warehouse assumes one-to-one mapping (true). Must include d_year in output for later grouping.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combining shared dimension CTE, prefetch fact join, and late attribute binding of warehouse).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS to CTEs; this query has none.
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR (time range) into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split t_time BETWEEN; it's a single-column range handled efficiently.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 33 columns (w_warehouse_name through dec_net) in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (warehouse attributes, fact aggregates, dimension keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must copy exact literals: d_year=1998, t_time between 48821 and 48821+28800, sm_carrier IN ('GREAT EASTERN','LATVIAN').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows as original union-aggregate.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date_dim, time_dim, ship_mode scanned twice (once per UNION branch)—predicates not shared across branches.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Dimension tables scanned twice; opportunity to reduce to one scan via shared CTE.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidating aggregates into a single pass per fact table, but keep separate for web and catalog. Ignore the CASE consolidation across channels.
- prefetch_fact_join: Apply pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation. Ignore the warehouse join—defer it.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply shared filtered dimensions CTE.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',

        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `w_warehouse_name`
  2. `w_warehouse_sq_ft`
  3. `w_city`
  4. `w_county`
  5. `w_state`
  6. `w_country`
  7. `ship_carriers`
  8. `year`
  9. `jan_sales`
  10. `feb_sales`
  11. `mar_sales`
  12. `apr_sales`
  13. `may_sales`
  14. `jun_sales`
  15. `jul_sales`
  16. `aug_sales`
  17. `sep_sales`
  18. `oct_sales`
  19. `nov_sales`
  20. `dec_sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate monthly channel metrics from web_sales and catalog_sales under shared warehouse/time/ship-mode filters, union channels, then roll up to warehouse/year/carrier totals including per-sq-ft calculations.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, warehouse, date_dim, time_dim, ship_mode, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (ws_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 1998)
    ├── FILTER (t_time BETWEEN 48821 AND 48821 + 28800)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (w_warehouse_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sq_ft, w_city, w_county, w_state, w_country, ship_carriers, year, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
