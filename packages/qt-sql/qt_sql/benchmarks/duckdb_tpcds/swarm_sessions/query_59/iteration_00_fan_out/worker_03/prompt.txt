You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare day-of-week sales ratios for each store between two consecutive 12-month periods starting at month sequence 1196, aligning weeks exactly 52 apart. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows from both periods. Aggregates are SUM with CASE, which are duplicate-insensitive but depend on week-month inclusion semantics: a week belongs to a period if ANY day in that week falls within the month range. Filter dependencies: month ranges (1196-1207 and 1208-1219) must be preserved exactly; week offset of 52 must be exact; store matching must be exact.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The pivot uses MAX(CASE) because each (store, week, period) has at most one row due to GROUP BY. This is safe.
  - Must adjust week offset: period2 weeks need to be aligned with period1 weeks by adding 52 before pivot? Actually we group by d_week_seq, but period2 weeks are 52 weeks later. We need to join on week offset. Solution: In sales_aggregates_cte, adjust d_week_seq for period2 by subtracting 52, so that weeks align. Then pivot on adjusted week.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline query already <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2898ms >> 100ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2898ms, so acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep dimension CTEs independent and join with fact sequentially.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 10 original columns in exact order: s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1, and 7 ratios.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: d_week_seq, ss_store_sk, sun_sales..sat_sales, s_store_sk, s_store_id, s_store_name, d_month_seq, d_date_sk.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve month range literals 1196, 1196+11, 1196+12, 1196+23 and week offset 52.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows, columns, and ordering as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Month predicates applied after CTE aggregation (EXPLAIN shows date_dim scans filtered by month_seq in main query, not in CTE).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times (1 in CTE + 2 in main query); store scanned twice.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

union_cte_split: Apply the pattern of splitting a generic CTE into specialized ones (here by period). Ignore the UNION aspect — we use CASE pivoting instead of UNION.
  rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply the pattern of replacing a self-join with explicit grouping and pivoting. Ignore the windowing aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name1`
  2. `s_store_id1`
  3. `d_week_seq1`
  4. `sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_sales2`
  5. `mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_sales2`
  6. `tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_sales2`
  7. `wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_sales2`
  8. `thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_sales2`
  9. `fri_sales1 / NULLIF(fri_sales2`
  10. `sat_sales1 / NULLIF(sat_sales2`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
