You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare day-of-week sales ratios for each store between two consecutive 12-month periods starting at month sequence 1196, aligning weeks exactly 52 apart. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows from both periods. Aggregates are SUM with CASE, which are duplicate-insensitive but depend on week-month inclusion semantics: a week belongs to a period if ANY day in that week falls within the month range. Filter dependencies: month ranges (1196-1207 and 1208-1219) must be preserved exactly; week offset of 52 must be exact; store matching must be exact.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The period discriminator (1,2) must be based on month_seq range, not week. A week may have days in both periods? Actually periods are disjoint (12 months each, consecutive). A week cannot span both periods because periods are 12 months apart. But a week could have days in two different months within the same period? That's fine; we label by month_seq range at date level.
  - Must adjust week offset in join: period1 week = period2 week - 52.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline query already <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2898ms >> 100ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2898ms, so acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep dimension CTEs independent and join with fact sequentially.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 10 original columns in exact order: s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1, and 7 ratios.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: d_week_seq, ss_store_sk, sun_sales..sat_sales, s_store_sk, s_store_id, s_store_name, d_month_seq, d_date_sk.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve month range literals 1196, 1196+11, 1196+12, 1196+23 and week offset 52.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows, columns, and ordering as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Month predicates applied after CTE aggregation (EXPLAIN shows date_dim scans filtered by month_seq in main query, not in CTE).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times (1 in CTE + 2 in main query); store scanned twice.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Apply the pattern of consolidating multiple period scans into one CTE with CASE-based period discrimination. Ignore the scalar subquery aspect — this query has no scalar subqueries.
  channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the pattern of labeling rows with a period discriminator and conditional aggregation. Ignore the bitmap aspect — we don't need bitmaps.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name1`
  2. `s_store_id1`
  3. `d_week_seq1`
  4. `sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_sales2`
  5. `mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_sales2`
  6. `tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_sales2`
  7. `wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_sales2`
  8. `thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_sales2`
  9. `fri_sales1 / NULLIF(fri_sales2`
  10. `sat_sales1 / NULLIF(sat_sales2`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] wss  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store sales by week and store into Sunday-through-Saturday sales buckets.
│   ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim (join))
│   ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (d_week_seq, ss_store_sk, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, ...)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build year1 and year2 weekly views from the bucketed data, match same store and week offset by 52, and compute day-level ratio comparisons.
    ├── SCAN (wss, store, date_dim AS d (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_id1 = s_store_id2)
    ├── JOIN (d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 52)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name1 ASC, s_store_id1 ASC, d_week_seq1 ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name1, s_store_id1, d_week_seq1, sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_sales2, mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_sales2, tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_sales2, wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_sales2, thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_sales2, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
