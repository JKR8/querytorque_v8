### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [~]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K — Changed join syntax from comma-separated to explicit INNER JOINs per target logical tree; added table aliases (ws, w, sm, web, d); no structural changes to CTEs (none used).

**Changes**: Only structural change is converting implicit joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax with table aliases as required by the target logical tree. Semantic equivalence is preserved with identical output columns, filters, grouping, and ordering.

**Expected speedup**: Neutral to slight (<1.05x). The explicit JOIN syntax helps DuckDB's optimizer see the join graph clearly, but baseline query performance is already efficient. No materialization overhead introduced since no CTEs were added.
