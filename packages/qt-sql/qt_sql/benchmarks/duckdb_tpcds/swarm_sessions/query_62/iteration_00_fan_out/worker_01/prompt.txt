You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Classify web order shipment latency over a 12-month window from month sequence 1194, grouped by warehouse (first 20 chars), ship mode type, and web site name. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all five tables. Aggregation uses SUM(CASE) which is duplicate-safe but depends on correct grouping by substring of warehouse name. The date filter (d_month_seq) is independent of other dimensions and must remain applied before joining with web_sales.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- If two warehouses share same first 20 characters, this strategy will produce separate rows (since grouped by ws_warehouse_sk). The original groups by substring, potentially merging them. This may break equivalence.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline query already <100ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 381ms, so CTE overhead acceptable, but avoid decomposing already efficient joins.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 381ms, acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with the fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, web_name, and five sum columns.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ws_warehouse_sk, ws_ship_mode_sk, ws_web_site_sk, ws_ship_date_sk, ws_sold_date_sk for fact; d_date_sk for date; w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name for warehouse; sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type for ship_mode; web_site_sk, web_name for web_site.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq values 1194 and 1194+11 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 420 rows ordered by substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, web_name, limited to 100.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The date filter is already pushed, but dimension CTEs could be isolated (though they have no filters).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single fact scan present; no redundancy to eliminate.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply the consolidation of aggregation into a single pass after filtering date, but ignore the multiple subquery aspect.
- pushdown: Apply pushing aggregation below joins, but ignore the consolidation of multiple subqueries.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,`
  2. `sm_type`
  3. `web_name`
  4. `30 days`
  5. `31-60 days`
  6. `61-90 days`
  7. `91-120 days`
  8. `>120 days`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with warehouse, ship mode, web site, and ship date; bucket ship-date minus sold-date into five ranges via CASE sums; and aggregate counts by shipping context.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, warehouse (join), ship_mode (join), web_site (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1194 AND 1194 + 11)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1, 20) ASC, sm_type ASC, web_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name, 1,, sm_type, web_name, 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, >120 days)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
