<reasoning>
CLASSIFY: This is a star-join aggregation query with a single fact table (web_sales) joined to four dimension tables (date_dim, warehouse, ship_mode, web_site). The query filters on date_dim (d_month_seq range) and groups by columns from three dimensions (warehouse substring, ship_mode type, web_site name). It performs conditional aggregation (CASE inside SUM) on a date difference computed from two fact table columns. This is a classic star schema aggregation with late projection of dimension attributes.

EXPLAIN PLAN ANALYSIS:
- Total execution time: 381ms
- Most time-consuming nodes:
    1. SEQ_SCAN web_sales: 83.8ms (22% of total, scans 1.4M of 86.4M rows)
    2. HASH_GROUP_BY: 123.3ms (32% of total, processes 1.4M rows → 420 groups)
    3. HASH_JOIN INNER on ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk: 12.9ms (3%)
- Row count progression:
    - date_dim: 366 rows after filter (from 73K)
    - web_sales: 1.4M rows scanned (filtered by join with date_dim)
    - After all joins: 1.4M rows (no reduction because dimensions are small)
    - After GROUP BY: 420 rows
- The optimizer already pushes the date filter into a SEQ_SCAN (FILTER node on date_dim). It uses hash joins and reorders joins starting with the filtered date_dim. The fact table is scanned once. No repeated scans. All joins are inner joins with perfect referential integrity (fact foreign keys to dimension primary keys).

GAP MATCHING:
1. CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The date filter is already pushed down by the optimizer. However, other dimension tables (warehouse, ship_mode, web_site) have no WHERE clauses but are small (10, 20, 42 rows). Pre-filtering them wouldn't reduce rows. No gap.
2. REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single scan of web_sales. No repeated scans to consolidate.
3. CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: No correlated subqueries.
4. CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: No OR conditions.
5. UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: No UNION ALL or self-joins.
6. AGGREGATION TRAPS: The aggregation uses SUM with CASE expressions. These are duplicate-safe (if joins introduce duplicates, the sum increases proportionally). The GROUP BY includes dimension attributes that are 1:1 with their surrogate keys (since we join on primary keys). However, note that the GROUP BY uses SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name,1,20). If two warehouses share the same first 20 characters, they would be grouped together. The current plan groups after joining, which is correct. Any rewrite must preserve this grouping semantics.

The main bottleneck is the HASH_GROUP_BY on 1.4M rows (123ms). The second largest cost is the web_sales scan (84ms). The joins are relatively cheap. The optimization opportunity is to reduce the number of rows entering the GROUP BY. Currently, we join all dimensions (bringing in 1.4M rows) then group. Since the dimensions are small, we could aggregate on the fact table keys first (reducing to 420 groups), then join to dimensions to fetch descriptive columns. This is an "aggregate_pushdown" strategy.

However, we must be careful: the final GROUP BY uses SUBSTRING(w_warehouse_name,1,20). If we aggregate by w_warehouse_sk first, we lose the ability to group warehouses with the same name prefix. But in TPCDS, warehouse names are likely unique. Still, we must preserve correctness. We can handle this by aggregating by the foreign keys, then joining with warehouse, then doing a second GROUP BY on the substring if necessary. But this adds overhead. Alternatively, we can push the aggregation below all joins except warehouse (since we need the warehouse name for the substring). But warehouse is only 10 rows, so joining it early is cheap.

Another opportunity: the conditional sums compute ws_ship_date_sk - ws_sold_date_sk. This computation happens on 1.4M rows. Could we pre-compute this difference in an early CTE? Not beneficial.

Given the above, I select these four strategies, each attacking a different aspect:

1. **aggregate_pushdown**: Push aggregation below dimension joins (except warehouse, because we need w_warehouse_name for grouping). Aggregate by ws_warehouse_sk, ws_ship_mode_sk, ws_web_site_sk after joining with date_dim, then join with warehouse, ship_mode, web_site, then compute substring and final group if needed. This reduces the rows for subsequent joins from 1.4M to 420.

2. **star_join_prefetch**: Pre-filter all dimension tables into CTEs (date_dim filtered, others as-is), then join them together with web_sales in a single CTE. This is similar to the current plan but explicit CTEs may help the optimizer with cardinality estimation.

3. **minimal_change_baseline**: Keep the original structure but rewrite with explicit JOIN syntax and ensure column completeness. This serves as a regression-safe baseline.

4. **compound_strategy_exploration**: Combine aggregate_pushdown with late_attribute_binding: defer the join to ship_mode and web_site until after aggregation, since their columns (sm_type, web_name) are only used in SELECT and GROUP BY, not in filters. This reduces join cardinality.

All strategies must preserve the exact output columns and ordering.

=== SHARED BRIEFING ===

SEMANTIC_CONTRACT: Classify web order shipment latency over a 12-month window from month sequence 1194, grouped by warehouse (first 20 chars), ship mode type, and web site name. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all five tables. Aggregation uses SUM(CASE) which is duplicate-safe but depends on correct grouping by substring of warehouse name. The date filter (d_month_seq) is independent of other dimensions and must remain applied before joining with web_sales.

BOTTLENECK_DIAGNOSIS: The query is aggregation-bound: HASH_GROUP_BY consumes 32% of runtime (123ms) processing 1.4M rows. The web_sales scan (84ms, 22%) is also significant. Joins are cheap (<13ms each). Cardinality flow: date_dim filter reduces to 366 rows, join with web_sales produces 1.4M rows, subsequent dimension joins do not reduce row count (dimensions are small), aggregation reduces to 420 groups. The optimizer already handles predicate pushdown (date filter into scan) and join reordering (starts with filtered date_dim). Logical-tree cost percentages are misleading: the GROUP BY appears as 32% but actually dominates wall-clock time.

ACTIVE_CONSTRAINTS:
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, web_name, and five sum columns.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ws_warehouse_sk, ws_ship_mode_sk, ws_web_site_sk, ws_ship_date_sk, ws_sold_date_sk for fact; d_date_sk for date; w_warehouse_sk, w_warehouse_name for warehouse; sm_ship_mode_sk, sm_type for ship_mode; web_site_sk, web_name for web_site.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq values 1194 and 1194+11 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 420 rows ordered by substr(w_warehouse_name,1,20), sm_type, web_name, limited to 100.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The date filter is already pushed, but dimension CTEs could be isolated (though they have no filters).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single fact scan present; no redundancy to eliminate.

REGRESSION_WARNINGS:
1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline query already <100ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 381ms, so CTE overhead acceptable, but avoid decomposing already efficient joins.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 381ms, acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with the fact table.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, pushdown

HAZARD_FLAGS:
- If two warehouses share same first 20 characters, this strategy will produce separate rows (since grouped by ws_warehouse_sk). The original groups by substring, potentially merging them. This may break equivalence.

HAZARD_FLAGS:
- Creating CTEs for small dimension tables may add materialization overhead with little benefit (engine may inline them). However, with multiple references (if CTEs are reused), materialization could help. Here each CTE is used once, so likely inlined.
