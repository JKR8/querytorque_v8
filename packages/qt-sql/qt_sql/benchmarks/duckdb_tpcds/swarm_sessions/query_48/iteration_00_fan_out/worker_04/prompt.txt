You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum 1999 store-sales quantity for transactions matching specific demographic-and-price combinations AND specific U.S. state/net-profit bands. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches on all dimensions. SUM is duplicate-safe, but restructuring must preserve row membership in the aggregated set. The OR conditions create 3×3=9 implicit combinations; any rewrite must preserve this logical intersection of two independent OR groups.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Bitmap encoding adds computation but may enable better predicate pushdown.
- Still single fact scan with complex join condition.
- Demo/addr groups must be mutually exclusive (they are).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combines single_pass CASE labeling with dimension bitmap joins to encode OR groups)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION branches, doubling fact scans.
   RULE: Only split ORs on DIFFERENT columns/tables; never split same-column ranges.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Acceptable here (1016ms baseline), but limit to ≤2 cascading fact-table CTEs.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join each to fact separately.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Output must be exactly SUM(ss_quantity).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all join keys and filtered columns referenced downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All literal values (1999, 'U', 'Primary', 100.00, etc.) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical sum.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR spans cd_marital_status/cd_education_status/ss_sales_price and ca_state/ss_net_profit.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: OR conditions prevent predicate pushdown into fact scan.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Adapt CASE labeling to encode OR groups; ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.
  channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use bitmap encoding for dimension groups; ignore the conditional aggregation.
  pushdown: Push dimension filters into bitmap CTEs; ignore the scan consolidation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUM(ss_quantity)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with store, demographics, address, and date; apply the OR-combined demographic/price clauses and OR-combined location/profit clauses; then return the total quantity sum.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store (join), customer_demographics (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 1999)
    └── OUTPUT (SUM(ss_quantity))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
