**Changes**: Restructured the original flat join into a CTE chain that prefilters all dimension tables before joining to the progressively reduced fact table. This follows the target logical tree exactly, applying multi-dimension prefetch and staged fact reduction patterns.

**Expected speedup**: 2-4x due to early reduction of fact table rows via date join and price/profit filtering, followed by hash joins with small pre-filtered dimension CTEs instead of scanning large tables repeatedly.
