You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare day-of-week sales between 1998 and 1999 by week sequence using combined web and catalog sales, returning per-day sales ratios for week pairs exactly 53 weeks apart. All joins are INNER (intersection). Aggregates are SUM with CASE; no grouping-sensitive functions. The year filters (d_year=1998 and d_year=1999) must be preserved exactly; removing either changes result.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must eliminate original wswscs CTE to avoid redundant materialization.
- Ensure wscs UNION is not duplicated (reference same UNION in both year CTEs? Better to define wscs as a CTE to avoid duplication).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting wswscs by year, ELIMINATE the original wswscs CTE entirely.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Acceptable here because baseline is 1974ms (>100ms).
3. multi_dimension_prefetch (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead.
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause (d_year=1998 or 1999).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output d_week_seq1 and 7 rounded ratios in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Every CTE must output d_week_seq and all 7 day sales columns (sun_sales..sat_sales).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep d_year=1998 and d_year=1999 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 2,513 rows ordered by d_week_seq1.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Year filter applied after CTE aggregation (EXPLAIN shows date_dim re-join).
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: CTE wswscs scanned twice with different year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split (Q74): Apply splitting of wswscs into year-specific CTEs; ignore the decorrelation aspect (no correlated subquery).
- pushdown (Q9): Push year filter into the CTE definition; ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.
- date_cte_isolate (Q6): Create filtered date CTEs; ignore the single-pass aggregation (already done).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name

           > case when t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_s_secyear.year_total / t_s_firstyear.year_total else null end

```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)

```

### 3. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

```sql

```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `d_week_seq1`
  2. `ROUND(sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_`
  3. `ROUND(mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_`
  4. `ROUND(tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_`
  5. `ROUND(wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_`
  6. `ROUND(thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_`
  7. `ROUND(fri_sales1 / NULLIF(fri_`
  8. `ROUND(sat_sales1 / NULLIF(sat_`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] wscs  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Combine web and catalog sales into a shared stream of (sold_date_sk, sales_price) rows so both channels are analyzed together.
│   ├── SCAN (web_sales, catalog_sales)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (sold_date_sk, sales_price)
├── [CTE] wswscs  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate the combined sales stream to weekly totals split into Sunday-through-Saturday sales buckets.
│   ├── SCAN (wscs, date_dim (join))
│   ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = sold_date_sk)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (d_week_seq, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Build 1998 and 1999 weekly views from the weekly bucketed totals, align weeks separated by 53, and compute day-by-day sales ratios with two-decimal rounding.
    ├── SCAN (wswscs, date_dim)
    ├── JOIN (d_week_seq1 = d_week_seq2 - 53)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (d_week_seq1 ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (d_week_seq1, ROUND(sun_sales1 / NULLIF(sun_, ROUND(mon_sales1 / NULLIF(mon_, ROUND(tue_sales1 / NULLIF(tue_, ROUND(wed_sales1 / NULLIF(wed_, ROUND(thu_sales1 / NULLIF(thu_, ROUND(fri_sales1 / NULLIF(fri_, ROUND(sat_sales1 / NULLIF(sat_)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
