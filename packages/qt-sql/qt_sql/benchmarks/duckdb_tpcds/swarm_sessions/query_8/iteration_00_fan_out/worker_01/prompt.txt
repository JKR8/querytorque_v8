You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute Q2 1998 net profit per store for stores whose ZIP prefix matches a targeted set of 5-digit ZIPs; the targeted set is the intersection of a fixed list of 5-digit ZIPs and ZIPs having more than 10 preferred customers. JOINs are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses SUM, which is duplicate-safe. The filter on store ZIP prefix (first 2 characters) depends on the INTERSECT result's ZIP prefix; pushing this filter into the INTERSECT computation must preserve semantics (still intersect full 5-digit sets).

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The single-pass rewrite must preserve INTERSECT semantics: original intersects static list (all rows) with grouped preferred customers. The single-pass filters static list BEFORE grouping, which is equivalent because grouping is on same column and condition is on same column.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert INTERSECT to materialized CTE that scans entire customer_address; keep as join or EXISTS.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.
3. pushdown (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside split versions, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When pushing filter into CTE, replace original CTE reference; don't keep both.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output s_store_name and sum(ss_net_profit) ordered by s_store_name.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ca_zip (or substr), s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_zip, d_date_sk, ss_net_profit, and join keys used downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must copy exact ZIP list values, date filters (d_qoy=2, d_year=1998), and c_preferred_cust_flag='Y'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and order must match original.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: customer_address scanned twice (EXPLAIN shows SEQ_SCAN customer_address twice: 476ms for static list, 3ms for group-by side).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Store ZIP prefix filter applied after INTERSECT; could be pushed earlier (EXPLAIN shows filter on substr(s_zip,1,2)=substr(V1.ca_zip,1,2) after INTERSECT result).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply the consolidation of two customer_address scans into one scan with join to customer and filtering by ZIP list. Ignore the CASE aggregation pattern — this query doesn't need per-bucket aggregation.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the principle of reducing multiple scans to one. Ignore the bitmap labeling — we just need a single filtered grouped set.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name`
  2. `SUM(ss_net_profit)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Derive eligible ZIP prefixes from an intersection subquery, join store sales/date/store, constrain to Q2 1998, match store ZIP prefixes to eligible customer ZIP prefixes, and sum net profit per store name.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim (join), store (join), customer_address (join), customer (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_store_sk = s_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_qoy = 2)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 1998)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, SUM(ss_net_profit))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
