You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute August 2000 total sales per Children-category item across store, catalog, and web channels for addresses at GMT offset -7. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all dimension tables. Aggregation uses SUM only, which is duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: date (year=2000, month=8), item (category='Children'), customer_address (gmt_offset=-7) must be applied identically across all three channels.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The UNION ALL of raw fact tables may be large (~1M rows) and could be slower if dimension joins are expensive.
- Must ensure join keys are correctly aliased (item_sk, date_sk, addr_sk).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert the IN subquery (already a semi-join) into a materialized CTE; keep as JOIN or semi-join.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially to the fact table.
3. pushdown (0.49x regression):
   CAUSE: Creating filtered CTEs alongside original CTEs caused redundant materialization and cardinality misestimates.
   RULE: When introducing filtered dimension CTEs, replace original dimension references entirely; do not keep both.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, total_sales ordered by i_item_id, total_sales ASC, LIMIT 100.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream joins and final SELECT (e.g., i_item_id, i_item_sk, d_date_sk, ca_address_sk, sales price columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literals: d_year=2000, d_moy=8, i_category='Children', ca_gmt_offset=-7.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each channel CTE independently scans and filters the same dimension tables (date_dim, item, customer_address), causing redundant work.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Item table scanned 6 times, customer_address scanned 3 times.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate the three channel scans into a single UNION ALL of raw rows before joining dimensions. Ignore the CASE WHEN labeling; we are not pivoting.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the idea of a single scan of the fact tables (via UNION ALL) before joining dimensions. Ignore the bitmap and conditional aggregation.
- pushdown: Push dimension filters into CTEs and join once. Ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `total_sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
