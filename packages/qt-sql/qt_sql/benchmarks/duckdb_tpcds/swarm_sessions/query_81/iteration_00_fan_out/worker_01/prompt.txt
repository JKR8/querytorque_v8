You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find California customers whose 2002 catalog return amount (including tax) exceeds 120% of the average return amount for their return state. All joins are INNER (intersection) except the correlated subquery which compares per state. Aggregation uses SUM and AVG, which are duplicate-safe if join multiplicity unchanged. Filter dependencies: date filter (d_year=2002) applies to returns; ca_state='CA' applies to customer's current address, not return address.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function may require extra sort partition; verify performance against hash group+join.
- Must ensure window AVG is computed over the same set as original subquery (all rows in CTE).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. decorrelate (0.71x on Q1):
   CAUSE: Pre-aggregating GROUP BY into CTEs loses incremental filter pushdown.
   RULE: Do not materialize aggregates if the optimizer already decorrelates efficiently (hash join present).
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominates.
   RULE: Avoid adding CTEs if baseline fast (240ms is borderline; focus on reducing scan cost).
3. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forces full scan.
   RULE: Not applicable; no EXISTS here.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 15 customer/address columns plus ctr_total_return, ordered identically.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream (ctr_customer_sk, ctr_state, ctr_total_return, possibly state_avg).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2002, ca_state='CA', multiplier 1.2.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must match original rows exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: ca_state='CA' filter cannot be pushed into CTE without changing semantics (average must be over all customers).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: CTE scanned twice; opportunity to consolidate scans.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic CTE used for both row source and average; can split.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- deferred_window_aggregation: Apply the principle of computing window function (state average) in the same CTE as the aggregation to avoid separate scan; ignore the FULL OUTER JOIN and carry-forward aspects.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_TO_WINDOW: Replace correlated subquery with window function computing average per state; ignore top-N-per-group pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`
  2. `c_salutation`
  3. `c_first_name`
  4. `c_last_name`
  5. `ca_street_number`
  6. `ca_street_name`
  7. `ca_street_type`
  8. `ca_suite_number`
  9. `ca_city`
  10. `ca_county`
  11. `ca_state`
  12. `ca_zip`
  13. `ca_country`
  14. `ca_gmt_offset`
  15. `ca_location_type`
  16. `ctr_total_return`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
