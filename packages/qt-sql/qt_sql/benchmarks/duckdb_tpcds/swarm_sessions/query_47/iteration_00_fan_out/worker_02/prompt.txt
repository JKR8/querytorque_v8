You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Detect 2001 monthly store-sales outliers by brand/category/store where a month's sales deviate by >10% from that year's average monthly sales, using adjacent-month context. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching keys in all joined tables. The window AVG is computed over the same partition as GROUP BY columns, ensuring each group's average is over its own months only. The final filter depends on avg_monthly_sales computed in v1; pushing it earlier would break window semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-aggregation by (ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sold_date_sk) may not reduce rows significantly (keys are high cardinality). However, it allows early aggregation before expensive dimension joins.
- Must ensure SUM of SUM is correct (no double-counting).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; instead, join each dimension CTE directly with the fact table.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering fact table before multi-way fact joins prevented optimizer reordering.
   RULE: For this query (only one fact table), pre-joining dimensions with fact is safe.
3. or_to_union (0.59x regression):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR into UNION duplicated fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split the date OR (same table, same column) into UNION.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Final output must be exactly the 6 columns from v2: s_store_name, d_year, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales, psum, nsum.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream consumers (e.g., v1 must include i_category, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales, rn for v2's self-join).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literal values: d_year=2001, d_year=2000 (2001-1), d_year=2002 (2001+1), d_moy=12, d_moy=1, deviation threshold 0.1.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows in same order (ORDER BY sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, nsum).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The main query filter `d_year = 2001` cannot be pushed into v1 because v1 needs adjacent months (Dec 2000, Jan 2002). However, dimension filters could be pre-applied via CTEs.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: v1 is scanned 3 times in v2 (self-join). Opportunity to eliminate self-join via LAG/LEAD.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply pre-aggregation of fact table by surrogate keys before joining dimensions; ignore CASE WHEN conditional aggregation (not needed).
- prefetch_fact_join: Use fact_agg as a pre-joined fact CTE; ignore dimension filtering (filters applied later in v1_enhanced).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) > 3188917
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid1, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid2, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid3, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid4, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid5 FROM store_sales
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales

```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
