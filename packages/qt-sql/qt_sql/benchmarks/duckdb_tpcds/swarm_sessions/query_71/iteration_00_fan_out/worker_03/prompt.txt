You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Report brand revenue by time for manager_id=1 items sold in Dec-1998 during breakfast/dinner. JOIN: All INNER joins - intersection semantics (all dimension matches required). Aggregation: Only SUM(ext_price), duplicate-insensitive. Filter dependencies: date_dim filter (d_moy=12,d_year=1998) applies to all 3 channels; item filter (i_manager_id=1) and time filter (t_meal_time IN breakfast/dinner) apply after UNION.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- join_item_time combines two dimensions in one join - optimizer might reorder poorly
- filtered_date might be inlined losing materialization benefit

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query is 421ms, so acceptable to try.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated; also forced suboptimal join order on 3+ fact table joins.
   RULE: This query has 421ms baseline and only 3 independent fact tables (no multi-way fact joins).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_moy=12, d_year=1998, i_manager_id=1, t_meal_time values exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 10K rows with same columns and ordering.
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_brand_id, i_brand, t_hour, t_minute, ext_price ordered by ext_price DESC, i_brand_id.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced downstream.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 3 times (31 rows each) - could pre-filter once.
- ENGINE_GAP_ID: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: dimension filters could be pushed earlier via staged CTEs.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- prefetch_fact_join: Apply staged CTE chain (filter dimension, pre-join with fact); ignore the multi-way fact join warning (this query has independent fact tables).
- pushdown: Apply pushing filters from outer query into CTEs; ignore the scalar subquery consolidation (not present).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `brand_id`
  2. `brand`
  3. `t_hour`
  4. `t_minute`
  5. `ext_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Union channel sales into a common stream with sold time keys, join item and time dimensions, filter to meal times breakfast/dinner, and aggregate ext_price by brand and minute-level time.
    ├── SCAN (item, store_sales (join), date_dim (join), web_sales (join), catalog_sales (join), time_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (sold_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (time_sk = t_time_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manager_id = 1)
    ├── FILTER ((t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t_meal_time = 'dinner'))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ext_price DESC, i_brand_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (brand_id, brand, t_hour, t_minute, ext_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
