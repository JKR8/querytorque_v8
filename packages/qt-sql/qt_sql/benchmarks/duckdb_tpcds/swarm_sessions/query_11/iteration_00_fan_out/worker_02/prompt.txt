You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers whose web sales growth ratio (2002/2001) exceeds their store sales growth ratio (2002/2001), requiring positive 2001 totals in both channels. The query uses INNER JOIN semantics (all four year/channel combinations must match for a customer), with SUM aggregates that are duplicate-insensitive. Filter dependencies: year filters (2001, 2002) and channel filters ('s','w') must be preserved in the four-way self-join, and the growth ratio comparison depends on positive year_total values.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must eliminate original year_total CTE completely to avoid redundant computation
- Each CTE still scans customer table separately (4 times) - opportunity for further optimization

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When splitting CTE by year/channel, ELIMINATE the original generic CTE completely
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <50ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated
   RULE: Baseline here is 9400ms, so transform applicable, but keep CTE chain minimal
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially to fact tables

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output t_s_secyear.customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country in that order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTEs must include customer_id, first_name, last_name, birth_country, dyear, year_total, sale_type for downstream joins
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: dyear=2001 and 2002, sale_type='s'/'w'
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same 100 rows ordered by customer_id, first_name, last_name, birth_country
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned twice (4000ms + 315ms), web_sales twice (1065ms + 46ms) - opportunity to consolidate
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic year_total CTE scanned 4 times with different year/channel filters
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Year/channel filters applied in main query self-joins, not pushed into CTE

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Split by year AND channel into 4 CTEs; eliminate original UNION CTE completely
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Extract date_dim filter into CTE but here we embed in each CTE; ignore sharing across channels
- date_cte_isolate: Push d_year filter into each CTE; ignore creating separate date CTE

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

### 3. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`
  4. `customer_birth_country`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] year_total  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build per-customer yearly totals for store and web channels from extended list price minus discount amount, tagging each row with channel sale type.
│   ├── SCAN (customer, store_sales (join), date_dim (join), web_sales (join))
│   ├── JOIN (c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_preferred_cust_flag, customer_birth_country, customer_login, customer_email_address, dyear, ...)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join 2001 and 2002 totals for both channels by customer, require positive baseline totals, compare web vs store growth ratios, and return matching customer identity fields.
    ├── SCAN (year_total AS t_s_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_s_secyear (join), year_total AS t_w_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_w_secyear (join))

    ├── JOIN (t_s_firstyear.customer_id = t_w_secyear.customer_id)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's')
    ├── FILTER (t_w_firstyear.sale_type = 'w')
    ├── FILTER (+9 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (t_s_secyear.customer_id ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_first_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_last_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_birth_country ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
