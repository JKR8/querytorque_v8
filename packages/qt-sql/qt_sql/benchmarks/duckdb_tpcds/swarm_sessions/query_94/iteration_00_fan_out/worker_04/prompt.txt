You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For web shipments to Oklahoma during a 60-day window from 2000-02-01 on company "pri" sites, report order count, shipping cost, and net profit for multi-warehouse orders with no returns. Joins are INNER (intersection) and SEMI/ANTI (existence filters). Aggregates are duplicate-insensitive (SUM, COUNT DISTINCT). Filter dependencies: multi-warehouse condition must be evaluated on the same order number but different warehouse; returns absence must be evaluated on the same order number.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The EXISTS condition now requires ws2 to also satisfy dimension filters (date, address, website). This changes semantics because original EXISTS does not have those filters. However, since ws1 and ws2 share the same order number, and ws1 already satisfies dimension filters, does requiring ws2 to also satisfy them affect the result? Possibly yes: ws2 could be from a different date/address/website but same order number (unlikely in real data but possible). This rewrite is not semantically equivalent! Must adjust: we cannot push dimension filters into ws2. Therefore, this strategy is risky and may produce wrong results.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This rewrite changes the semantics of the EXISTS condition by adding dimension filters to ws2. In the original query, ws2 is not constrained by date, address, or website. However, in the TPC-DS schema, an order number is associated with a single sale date, ship address, and website? Need to check schema constraints. If ws_order_number determines ws_ship_date_sk, ws_ship_addr_sk, ws_web_site_sk (i.e., all rows for same order have same dimension keys), then pushing filters is safe. But we cannot assume that. Safer approach: do not push dimension filters into ws2; instead, compute multi-warehouse condition on the set of orders that pass dimension filters (as in

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan and losing semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE unless you can push filters into it.
2. single_pass_aggregation (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Not applicable (no OR). But ensure consolidation doesn't introduce UNION branches.
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Baseline is 366ms, so CTE overhead likely acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output "order count", "total shipping cost", "total net profit".
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ws_order_number, ws_ext_ship_cost, ws_net_profit, ws_warehouse_sk, and join keys for downstream consumers.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '2000-2-01', interval 60 DAY, state 'OK', company 'pri'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must be identical to original.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: web_sales scanned twice; opportunity to consolidate.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs exist currently, but creating CTEs may allow predicate pushdown into EXISTS subquery.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- pushdown (Q9): Push dimension filters into the EXISTS subquery (by joining ws2 with filtered_dimensions). This reduces the scan in EXISTS from entire web_sales to filtered set. Ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.
- early_filter (Q11): Filter dimension tables first, then use them in both main and subquery. Apply to both ws1 and ws2.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

and ca_state = 'OK'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `order count`
  2. `total shipping cost`
  3. `total net profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter web sales by ship date range, destination state, and web company; require existence of same order across different warehouses; exclude orders present in web_returns; then aggregate order/profitability metrics.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales AS ws1 (join), date_dim (join), customer_address (join), web_site (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2000-2-01' AND (CAST('2000-2-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
