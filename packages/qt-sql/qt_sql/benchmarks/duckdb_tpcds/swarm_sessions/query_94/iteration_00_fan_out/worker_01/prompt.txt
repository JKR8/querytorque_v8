You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For web shipments to Oklahoma during a 60-day window from 2000-02-01 on company "pri" sites, report order count, shipping cost, and net profit for multi-warehouse orders with no returns. Joins are INNER (intersection) and SEMI/ANTI (existence filters). Aggregates are duplicate-insensitive (SUM, COUNT DISTINCT). Filter dependencies: multi-warehouse condition must be evaluated on the same order number but different warehouse; returns absence must be evaluated on the same order number.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The EXISTS in multi_warehouse_flag may still cause a second scan of candidate_orders (if not optimized). Consider using a window function (COUNT(DISTINCT ws_warehouse_sk) OVER (PARTITION BY ws_order_number)) to flag rows.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan and losing semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE unless you can push filters into it.
2. single_pass_aggregation (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Not applicable (no OR). But ensure consolidation doesn't introduce UNION branches.
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Baseline is 366ms, so CTE overhead likely acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output "order count", "total shipping cost", "total net profit".
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ws_order_number, ws_ext_ship_cost, ws_net_profit, ws_warehouse_sk, and join keys for downstream consumers.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '2000-2-01', interval 60 DAY, state 'OK', company 'pri'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must be identical to original.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: web_sales scanned twice; opportunity to consolidate.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs exist currently, but creating CTEs may allow predicate pushdown into EXISTS subquery.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply consolidation of multiple scans into one CTE (candidate_orders) that pre-filters dimensions; compute multi-warehouse condition within same CTE using EXISTS (but note we still have a correlated subquery; could use window function). Ignore the CASE aggregation pattern.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Apply single scan with dimension filters; ignore the CASE labeling for channels.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `order count`
  2. `total shipping cost`
  3. `total net profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter web sales by ship date range, destination state, and web company; require existence of same order across different warehouses; exclude orders present in web_returns; then aggregate order/profitability metrics.

    └── OUTPUT (order count, total shipping cost, total net profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
