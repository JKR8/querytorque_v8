You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Report per-item and per-store profitability for April 2000 store sales linked to subsequent returns and catalog sales (Apr-Oct 2000). All joins are INNER, requiring matches across all three fact tables and dimensions. Aggregates are SUMs, which are sensitive to row duplication if joins change multiplicities (especially the store_sales to catalog_sales join). The date filters on d2 and d3 depend on the existence of matching returns and catalog sales; moving these filters earlier could break the linkage.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Aggregating before joining store and item assumes the join is one-to-one (true for surrogate keys). Must include ss_item_sk and ss_store_sk in GROUP BY.
- The aggregation may change semantics if the join produces duplicates per (ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk). Verify that the original query's join does not create multiple rows per (item, store) combination beyond those already grouped.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and joined store_sales to date CTE before the 3-way fact table join, materializing early and preventing optimizer from reordering joins and pushing filters across fact tables.
   RULE: Do not materialize fact tables in CTEs before the multi-way fact join. Keep fact tables in main join block or join them late.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_store_id, s_store_name, store_sales_profit, store_returns_loss, catalog_sales_profit.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (especially join keys and aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literals: d_moy=4, d_year=2000, d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 10, etc.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The optimizer already pushes date filters, but CTEs could help control join order.
- REGRESSION_RISK: Pre-filtering fact tables into CTEs before multi-way join caused 0.5x regression on this query (q25).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply the idea of consolidating multiple aggregations into one pass. Here we aggregate early after joins, reducing rows before dimension joins. Ignore the CASE WHEN patterns; we use simple SUM.
- deferred_window_aggregation (Q51): Apply the principle of delaying expensive operations (here dimension joins) until after aggregation. Ignore the window functions.
- pushdown (Q9): Apply pushing aggregates down into the join tree. Ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)

                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql

SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

```

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `s_store_id`
  4. `s_store_name`
  5. `store_sales_profit`
  6. `store_returns_loss`
  7. `catalog_sales_profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
