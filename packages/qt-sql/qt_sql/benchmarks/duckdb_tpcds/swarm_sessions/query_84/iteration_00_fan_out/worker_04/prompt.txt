You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

List customers residing in Oakwood whose household income band falls within 5806-55806 and have matching customer demographics in store returns. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches in all six tables. No aggregation functions exist, so no aggregation traps. Filter dependencies: city filter applies to customer_address, income bounds to income_band, and both propagate via join keys (ca_address_sk, hd_income_band_sk) to customer and household_demographics respectively.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
exact_keys -> sr_filter -> enrich -> top_n
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  exact_keys:
    FROM: customer, customer_address, household_demographics, income_band, customer_demographics
    JOIN: c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN: hd_income_band_sk = ib_income_band_sk
    JOIN: c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
    JOIN: cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
    WHERE: ca_city = 'Oakwood' AND ib_lower_bound >= 5806 AND ib_upper_bound <= 55806
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, cd_demo_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~783
    CONSUMERS: sr_filter
  sr_filter:
    FROM: exact_keys
    WHERE: EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM store_returns WHERE sr_cdemo_sk = exact_keys.cd_demo_sk)
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~783 (but actual matching ~1,158? Need distinct)
    CONSUMERS: enrich
  enrich:
    FROM: sr_filter
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, COALESCE(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name,'') AS customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: same as sr_filter
    CONSUMERS: top_n
  top_n:
    FROM: enrich
    ORDER BY: c_customer_id ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: customer_id, customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 100
    CONSUMERS: final

NODE_CONTRACTS:
exact_keys:
    FROM: customer, customer_address, household_demographics, income_band, customer_demographics
    JOIN: c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
    JOIN: hd_income_band_sk = ib_income_band_sk
    JOIN: c_current_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
    JOIN: cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
    WHERE: ca_city = 'Oakwood' AND ib_lower_bound >= 5806 AND ib_upper_bound <= 55806
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, c_first_name, c_last_name, cd_demo_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~783
    CONSUMERS: sr_filter
  sr_filter:
    FROM: exact_keys
    WHERE: EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM store_returns WHERE sr_cdemo_sk = exact_keys.cd_demo_sk)

    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~783 (but actual matching ~1,158? Need distinct)
    CONSUMERS: enrich
  enrich:
    FROM: sr_filter
    OUTPUT: c_customer_id, COALESCE(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || COALESCE(c_first_name,'') AS customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: same as sr_filter
    CONSUMERS: top_n
  top_n:
    FROM: enrich
    ORDER BY: c_customer_id ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: customer_id, customername
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 100
    CONSUMERS: final

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- EXISTS may force nested loop join instead of hash join, potentially slower.
- Need to ensure output matches original exactly (same 100 rows, same order).
- DISTINCT may be needed if customer has multiple store returns.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs in this query; ensure each CTE joins directly via foreign keys.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 174ms, so CTE overhead may still be acceptable but must be minimized.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output customer_id and customername exactly as original.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, customer attributes).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve 'Oakwood', 5806, 50000 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows in same order.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows store_returns scan uses derived range instead of exact cd_demo_sk list from filtered dimensions.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- intersect_to_exists: Apply converting a join pattern to EXISTS for short-circuiting; ignore INTERSECT-specific aspects.
- decorrelate: This is the inverse - we're introducing a correlated EXISTS, but the pattern of pre-computing keys applies.
- early_filter: Apply filtering dimensions early in exact_keys CTE; ignore the join structure.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

**AFTER (fast):**
[cross_items_flat]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_item_sk AS ss_item_sk FROM item i WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM store_sales, item iss, date_dim d1 WHERE ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk AND d1.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND iss.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND iss.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND iss.i_category_id = i.i_category_id) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM catalog_sales, item ics, date_dim d2 WHERE cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk AND cs_sold_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk AND d2.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND ics.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND ics.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND ics.i_category_id = i.i_category_id) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales, item iws, date_dim d3 WHERE ws_item_sk = iws.i_item_sk AND ws_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk AND d3.d_year BETWEEN 1999 AND 2001 AND iws.i_brand_id = i.i_brand_id AND iws.i_class_id = i.i_class_id AND iws.i_category_id = i.i_category_id)
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE i_item_sk IN (SELECT ss_item_sk FROM cross_items_flat) ...
```

### 2. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 3. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 84 in stream 0 using template query84.tpl
select c_customer_id as customer_id
       , coalesce(c_last_name,'') || ', ' || coalesce(c_first_name,'') as customername
 from customer
     ,customer_address
     ,customer_demographics
     ,household_demographics
     ,income_band
     ,store_returns
 where ca_city	        =  'Oakwood'
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and ib_lower_bound   >=  5806
   and ib_upper_bound   <=  5806 + 50000
   and ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk
   and cd_demo_sk = c_current_cdemo_sk
   and hd_demo_sk = c_current_hdemo_sk
   and sr_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
 order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 84 in stream 0 using template query84.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customername`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join customer, current address, demographics, household demographics, income band, and store returns on demographic keys; apply city and income-band bounds; and output ordered customer name/id fields.
    ├── SCAN (customer, customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), income_band (join), store_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (ca_city = 'Oakwood')
    ├── FILTER (ib_lower_bound >= 5806)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (c_customer_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customername)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
