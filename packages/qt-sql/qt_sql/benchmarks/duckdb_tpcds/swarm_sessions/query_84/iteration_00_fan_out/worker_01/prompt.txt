You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

List customers residing in Oakwood whose household income band falls within 5806-55806 and have matching customer demographics in store returns. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches in all six tables. No aggregation functions exist, so no aggregation traps. Filter dependencies: city filter applies to customer_address, income bounds to income_band, and both propagate via join keys (ca_address_sk, hd_income_band_sk) to customer and household_demographics respectively.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk of CTE materialization overhead on small intermediate results (~795 rows).
- Must preserve all original join conditions exactly.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs in this query; ensure each CTE joins directly via foreign keys.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 174ms, so CTE overhead may still be acceptable but must be minimized.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output customer_id and customername exactly as original.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, customer attributes).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve 'Oakwood', 5806, 50000 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows in same order.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows store_returns scan uses derived range instead of exact cd_demo_sk list from filtered dimensions.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply pre-filtering of each dimension table into separate CTEs; ignore cross-joining them - join sequentially via keys.
- prefetch_fact_join: Apply the CTE chain that progressively reduces data; ignore the multi-fact aspect (only one fact table).
- multi_dimension_prefetch: Apply pre-filtering of multiple dimensions (customer_address, income_band) before joining; ignore store pre-filtering (not in query).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 3. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Tuesday') then ss_sales_price else  null end) tue_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_day_name FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_store_id FROM store WHERE s_gmt_offset = -5
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales LIMIT 100
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customername`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join customer, current address, demographics, household demographics, income band, and store returns on demographic keys; apply city and income-band bounds; and output ordered customer name/id fields.
    ├── SCAN (customer, customer_address (join), customer_demographics (join), household_demographics (join), income_band (join), store_returns (join))
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ib_income_band_sk = hd_income_band_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (ca_city = 'Oakwood')
    ├── FILTER (ib_lower_bound >= 5806)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (c_customer_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customername)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
