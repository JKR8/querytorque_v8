You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Calculate November 1999 promotional-store-sales share for Jewelry in GMT offset -7 by dividing promotion-qualified sales by total sales under the same geography/category constraints. All joins are INNER (intersection) except promotion which is optional for total sales (LEFT JOIN preserves all sales rows). Aggregation uses SUM only (no grouping-sensitive traps). Filters on customer_address (ca_gmt_offset), item (i_category), store (s_gmt_offset), and date_dim (d_year, d_moy) must apply to both promotional and total sales; the promotion filter (p_channel_* OR) applies only to promotional sales.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- LEFT JOIN filtered_promotion must not filter out rows; use LEFT JOIN to preserve all sales for total.
- Ensure filtered_promotion CTE includes only rows matching OR condition; otherwise promotional sum may be incorrect.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact table scans.
   RULE: Only split OR on different columns of the same table, and only on dimension tables (not fact). Here, OR is on promotion table columns, not store_sales.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: CTE materialization overhead dominated on fast baseline (<50ms).
   RULE: Baseline is 54ms; still borderline. Use lightweight CTEs (filter only, no aggregation) to minimize overhead.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output promotions, total, and calculated percentage exactly as original.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, ss_ext_sales_price, promotion flags).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal filters: ca_gmt_offset=-7, i_category='Jewelry', p_channel_dmail='Y', etc., d_year=1999, d_moy=11, s_gmt_offset=-7.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must be identical single row with same numeric values.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Two store_sales scans present (EXPLAIN shows 2x SEQ_SCAN store_sales).
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: Promotion filter ORs on three different columns (p_channel_dmail, p_channel_email, p_channel_tv).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same dimension filters applied in two separate subqueries.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply the pattern of merging multiple subqueries into one CTE with CASE aggregates. Ignore the scalar subquery context; adapt to our two subqueries.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Apply consolidation of repeated fact scans into a single scan with conditional aggregation. Ignore the bitmap labeling; we only have two conditions (promotional vs total).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `promotions`
  2. `total`
  3. `CAST(promotions AS DECIMAL(15,`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
