You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return items in price band [17,47] from manufacturers {639,169,138,339} that had inventory between 100-500 units during 60 days starting 1999-07-09 and also appear in store sales (any time). All joins are INNER (intersection), so an item must match all four tables. No aggregate functions; GROUP BY only removes duplicates from the many-to-many join with store_sales. Filters on i_current_price, i_manufact_id, inv_quantity_on_hand, and d_date are independent and can be pushed early.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- EXISTS may force nested loop joins if optimizer doesn't convert to hash semi-join.
- Ensure EXISTS subqueries are correlated correctly (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk, ss_item_sk = i_item_sk).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (observed regression: 0.5x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering and materializing fact table joins before multi-way fact joins prevents optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Do not materialize store_sales join before other fact tables (none here, but avoid unnecessary CTE chains).
2. dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression: 0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially or with fact table.
3. or_to_union (observed regression: 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR doubled fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split i_manufact_id IN (list) into UNION—it's same-column.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream: i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price, and join keys (inv_item_sk, d_date_sk, ss_item_sk).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Literals '1999-07-09', 17, 30, 100, 500, manufacturer IDs must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, same ordering (i_item_id ASC), same limit (100).
- ENGINE_GAP_SEMI_JOIN_OPTIMIZATION: The INNER JOIN with store_sales inflates rows before grouping; converting to semi-join could avoid this.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

intersect_to_exists: Apply the pattern of replacing an INTERSECT with EXISTS—here replace the inner join with store_sales with EXISTS. Ignore the INTERSECT-specific sorting.
  multi_intersect_exists_cte: Use correlated EXISTS subqueries for inventory/date and store_sales. Ignore the date/channel CTE pre-materialization.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_current_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join item, inventory, date, and store sales; apply price/manufacturer/inventory/date filters; group by item identity; and output qualifying item records.
    ├── SCAN (item, inventory (join), date_dim (join), store_sales (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = inv_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_current_price BETWEEN 17 AND 17 + 30)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",

      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
