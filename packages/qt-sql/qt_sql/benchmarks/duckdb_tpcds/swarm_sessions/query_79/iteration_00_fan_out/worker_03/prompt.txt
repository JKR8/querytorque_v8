You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return Monday ticket-level coupon/profit summaries for 1998-2000 store transactions in medium-sized stores with specific household dependent/vehicle conditions, along with customer names and store city. All joins are INNER, requiring matches on all sides. Aggregates are SUMs, insensitive to duplicates but must preserve group membership defined by ticket, customer, address, and store city. The OR condition on household_demographics (hd_dep_count=5 OR hd_vehicle_count>4) must be preserved; the optimizer may currently apply only one filter.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk that the optimizer may already do this join reordering; rewrite may have no effect.
- Cartesian product of dimension subqueries if incorrectly structured (avoid by joining each directly with fact table).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x on Q90): CAUSE: split same-column time range, doubling fact scans. RULE: Do not split same-column ORs; this query's OR is on different columns, so safe.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.0076x on Q26): CAUSE: cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion. RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join each directly with fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, substr(s_city,1,30), ss_ticket_number, amt, profit in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., s_city, ss_customer_sk, ss_ticket_number).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Preserve literal values: d_dow=1, d_year in (1998,1999,2000), s_number_employees between 200 and 295, hd_dep_count=5, hd_vehicle_count>4.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, and ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION - OR on hd_dep_count and hd_vehicle_count; EXPLAIN shows only hd_dep_count=5 filter.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS - Dimension filters could be pre-applied to reduce fact scan rows.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- Apply filtering dimension tables in subqueries before joining with fact table. Ignore CTE materialization; use subqueries in FROM/JOIN.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20)

                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30)`
  4. `ss_ticket_number`
  5. `amt`
  6. `profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate ticket metrics by customer and store city under date/store/household filters, join to customer names, and order results by customer and profitability.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (c_last_name ASC, c_first_name ASC, SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30) ASC, profit ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_last_name, c_first_name, SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30), ss_ticket_number, amt, profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
