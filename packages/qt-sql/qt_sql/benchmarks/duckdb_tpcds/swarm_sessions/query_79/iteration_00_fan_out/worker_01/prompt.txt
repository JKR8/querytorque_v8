You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return Monday ticket-level coupon/profit summaries for 1998-2000 store transactions in medium-sized stores with specific household dependent/vehicle conditions, along with customer names and store city. All joins are INNER, requiring matches on all sides. Aggregates are SUMs, insensitive to duplicates but must preserve group membership defined by ticket, customer, address, and store city. The OR condition on household_demographics (hd_dep_count=5 OR hd_vehicle_count>4) must be preserved; the optimizer may currently apply only one filter.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Risk of duplicating fact scans if the UNION branches are not optimized to share dimension joins (but each branch will scan store_sales independently).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x on Q90): CAUSE: split same-column time range, doubling fact scans. RULE: Do not split same-column ORs; this query's OR is on different columns, so safe.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.0076x on Q26): CAUSE: cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion. RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join each directly with fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, substr(s_city,1,30), ss_ticket_number, amt, profit in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., s_city, ss_customer_sk, ss_ticket_number).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Preserve literal values: d_dow=1, d_year in (1998,1999,2000), s_number_employees between 200 and 295, hd_dep_count=5, hd_vehicle_count>4.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, and ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION - OR on hd_dep_count and hd_vehicle_count; EXPLAIN shows only hd_dep_count=5 filter.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS - Dimension filters could be pre-applied to reduce fact scan rows.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- Apply splitting OR on different columns into UNION ALL branches. Ignore any decorrelation or date CTE patterns — this query has no correlated subqueries and date filters are simple.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 79 in stream 0 using template query79.tpl
select
  c_last_name,c_first_name,substr(s_city,1,30),ss_ticket_number,amt,profit
  from
   (select ss_ticket_number
          ,ss_customer_sk
          ,store.s_city
          ,sum(ss_coupon_amt) amt
          ,sum(ss_net_profit) profit
    from store_sales,date_dim,store,household_demographics
    where store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    and store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk  
    and store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    and (household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 5 or household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count > 4)
    and date_dim.d_dow = 1
    and date_dim.d_year in (1998,1998+1,1998+2) 
    and store.s_number_employees between 200 and 295
    group by ss_ticket_number,ss_customer_sk,ss_addr_sk,store.s_city) ms,customer
    where ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 order by c_last_name,c_first_name,substr(s_city,1,30), profit
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 79 in stream 0 using template query79.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30)`
  4. `ss_ticket_number`
  5. `amt`
  6. `profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate ticket metrics by customer and store city under date/store/household filters, join to customer names, and order results by customer and profitability.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (c_last_name ASC, c_first_name ASC, SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30) ASC, profit ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_last_name, c_first_name, SUBSTRING(s_city, 1, 30), ss_ticket_number, amt, profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
