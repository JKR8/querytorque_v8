You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare weekly item revenue consistency across store, catalog, and web channels for the week containing 2001-03-24, returning items whose channel revenues are all within +/-10% of each other. All three channel CTEs must match on item_id (INNER JOIN semantics). Only SUM aggregates are used, which are grouping-insensitive to duplicates. The date filter subquery is identical across all three CTEs; any rewrite must preserve that all three channels filter to the exact same week.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure date_week_cte returns exact same dates as original subquery (all dates in the week).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 266ms, so CTE overhead acceptable
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each has WHERE clause

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 8 columns (item_id, ss_item_rev, ss_dev, cs_item_rev, cs_dev, ws_item_rev, ws_dev, average) in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream, especially item_id and revenue aggregates.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal '2001-03-24' exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY ss_items.item_id, ss_item_rev).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each channel CTE independently computes same date filter (EXPLAIN shows 9 date_dim scans).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: item table scanned 3 times with identical unfiltered scans (EXPLAIN shows 3× SEQ_SCAN item).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- date_cte_isolate: Apply the pattern of extracting date filter into shared CTE; ignore that Q6/Q11 had multiple date ranges - here we have one week.
- early_filter: Apply filtering small dimension (date_dim) first; ignore the reason table filter - we only have date.
- pushdown: Apply consolidating repeated date subqueries; ignore the 15+ scalar subqueries - we have 3 channel CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)

                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `item_id`
  2. `ss_item_rev`
  3. `ss_dev`
  4. `cs_item_rev`
  5. `cs_dev`
  6. `ws_item_rev`
  7. `ws_dev`
  8. `average`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
