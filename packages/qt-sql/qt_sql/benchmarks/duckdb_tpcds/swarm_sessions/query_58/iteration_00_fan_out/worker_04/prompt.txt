You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare weekly item revenue consistency across store, catalog, and web channels for the week containing 2001-03-24, returning items whose channel revenues are all within +/-10% of each other. All three channel CTEs must match on item_id (INNER JOIN semantics). Only SUM aggregates are used, which are grouping-insensitive to duplicates. The date filter subquery is identical across all three CTEs; any rewrite must preserve that all three channels filter to the exact same week.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Using multiplication (sales_price * is_store) may have precision issues vs CASE.
- NULLIF in ratio checks to avoid division by zero (original filters would fail on zero revenue).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 266ms, so CTE overhead acceptable
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each has WHERE clause

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 8 columns (item_id, ss_item_rev, ss_dev, cs_item_rev, cs_dev, ws_item_rev, ws_dev, average) in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream, especially item_id and revenue aggregates.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal '2001-03-24' exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY ss_items.item_id, ss_item_rev).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each channel CTE independently computes same date filter (EXPLAIN shows 9 date_dim scans).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: item table scanned 3 times with identical unfiltered scans (EXPLAIN shows 3× SEQ_SCAN item).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- star_join_prefetch: Apply pre-filtering all dimensions (date, item) before fact joins; ignore the multi-table join complexity - we use UNION.
- scan_consolidation_pivot: Apply consolidating multiple channel scans into single pass with discriminator columns; ignore the pivot warning - we use multiplication not CASE.
- single_pass_aggregation: Apply computing all channel aggregates in one GROUP BY; ignore the scalar subquery pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `item_id`
  2. `ss_item_rev`
  3. `ss_dev`
  4. `cs_item_rev`
  5. `cs_dev`
  6. `ws_item_rev`
  7. `ws_dev`
  8. `average`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
