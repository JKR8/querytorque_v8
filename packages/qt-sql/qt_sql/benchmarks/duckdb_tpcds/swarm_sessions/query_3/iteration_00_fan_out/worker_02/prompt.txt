You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute yearly total store sales revenue by brand for items from manufacturer 816 sold in November. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all three tables. The only aggregate is SUM, which is duplicate-insensitive given the current join relationships. Filter dependencies: item.i_manufact_id=816 and dt.d_moy=11 must remain applied to their respective tables; moving these filters could change results.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
explicit_joins -> group_agg -> order_limit
NODE_CONTRACTS:
explicit_joins:
    FROM: store_sales
          INNER JOIN date_dim ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
          INNER JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE: item.i_manufact_id = 816 AND date_dim.d_moy = 11
    OUTPUT: store_sales.ss_sales_price, date_dim.d_year, item.i_brand_id, item.i_brand
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1,211
    CONSUMERS: group_agg
group_agg:
    FROM: explicit_joins
    GROUP BY: d_year, i_brand, i_brand_id
    AGGREGATE: sum(ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
    OUTPUT: d_year, i_brand_id, i_brand, sum_agg
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 67
    CONSUMERS: order_limit
order_limit:
    FROM: group_agg
    ORDER BY: d_year ASC, sum_agg DESC, i_brand_id ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: d_year, i_brand_id AS brand_id, i_brand AS brand, sum_agg
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 67→100
    CONSUMERS: final

NODE_CONTRACTS:

          INNER JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
    WHERE: item.i_manufact_id = 816 AND date_dim.d_moy = 11
    OUTPUT: store_sales.ss_sales_price, date_dim.d_year, item.i_brand_id, item.i_brand

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- No structural changes; low risk but may not improve performance.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and materialized store_sales with date CTE before a 3-way fact table join, losing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table; no multi-fact joins to break.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with the fact table.
3. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Baseline 326ms > 100ms, CTE overhead likely acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output d_year, brand_id, brand, sum_agg in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Every CTE must include all columns referenced downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Keep i_manufact_id=816 and d_moy=11 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs exist currently; introducing CTEs may create optimization fences.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Only one store_sales scan; restructuring must not increase scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

No examples; this is a syntactic rewrite only.

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 3 in stream 0 using template query3.tpl
select dt.d_year 
       ,item.i_brand_id brand_id 
       ,item.i_brand brand
       ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_agg
 from  date_dim dt 
      ,store_sales
      ,item
 where dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
   and store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
   and item.i_manufact_id = 816
   and dt.d_moy=11
 group by dt.d_year
      ,item.i_brand
      ,item.i_brand_id
 order by dt.d_year
         ,sum_agg desc
         ,brand_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 3 in stream 0 using template query3.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `d_year`
  2. `brand_id`
  3. `brand`
  4. `sum_agg`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join date, store sales, and item; filter to November and manufacturer 816; aggregate revenue by year and brand; then return the ordered top rows.
    ├── SCAN (date_dim AS dt (join), store_sales (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (item.i_manufact_id = 816)
    ├── FILTER (dt.d_moy = 11)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (dt.d_year ASC, sum_agg DESC, brand_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (d_year, brand_id, brand, sum_agg)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
