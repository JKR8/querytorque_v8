You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: For returns processed in August 2001, bucket store return latency (days between sale and return) into five ranges and report counts per store identity/address.
JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER; each store_sales row must match a store_returns row (on ticket, item, customer) and both date dimensions (sale date and return date) and store.
Aggregation traps: Aggregates are SUM of CASE expressions counting rows; duplicates from joins would inflate counts, but INNER joins on composite key likely preserve 1:1.
Filter dependencies: The filter d2.d_year=2001 AND d2.d_moy=8 must be applied to store_returns via d2; d1 has no explicit filter but joins on ss_sold_date_sk.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The join order may force store_sales to be joined after store_returns, which is already the optimizer's choice.
  - Materializing intermediate CTEs may add overhead.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25_prefetch_fact_join):
   CAUSE: Pre-joining fact tables with dimension CTEs before multi-way fact joins prevented optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact tables when multiple fact tables exist; this query has only two fact tables (store_sales, store_returns) so may be safe.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (regression_q26_dimension_cte_isolate):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join each dimension with facts separately.
3. date_cte_isolate (regression_q31_date_cte_isolate):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 1095ms, so CTE overhead likely acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output 10 store columns and 5 aggregate columns.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Keep d_year=2001 and d_moy=8 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match exactly.
- ENGINE_GAP_CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The optimizer already pushes d2 filter, but explicit CTEs may allow better join ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP_REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: No repeated scans, but CTE materialization may reduce rescanning of dimensions.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the staged join pipeline: filter dimension (d2), pre-join with fact (store_returns), then join with other fact (store_sales), then join remaining dimensions (d1, store). Ignore any multi-fact join reordering warnings; this query has only two fact tables.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name`
  2. `s_company_id`
  3. `s_street_number`
  4. `s_street_name`
  5. `s_street_type`
  6. `s_suite_number`
  7. `s_city`
  8. `s_county`
  9. `s_state`
  10. `s_zip`
  11. `30 days`
  12. `31-60 days`
  13. `61-90 days`
  14. `91-120 days`
  15. `>120 days`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales, returns, store, and date dimensions; filter return month/year; compute day-difference buckets with CASE expressions; then aggregate bucket counts by detailed store attributes.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), store (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+4 more)
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_year = 2001)
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_moy = 8)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC, s_company_id ASC, s_street_number ASC, s_street_name ASC, s_street_type ASC, s_suite_number ASC, s_city ASC, s_county ASC, s_state ASC, s_zip ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, s_company_id, s_street_number, s_street_name, s_street_type, s_suite_number, s_city, s_county, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
