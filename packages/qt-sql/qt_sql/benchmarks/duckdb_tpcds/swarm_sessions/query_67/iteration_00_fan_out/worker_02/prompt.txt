You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Rank product hierarchy rows by sales within each category over a 12-month period, using rollup aggregates across category/class/brand/product/time/store dimensions and keeping top 100 per category. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all four tables. The SUM aggregation is duplicate-sensitive (joins must not multiply rows incorrectly). The rank filter (rk <= 100) depends on the complete rollup result per category; any rewrite must preserve the same grouping sets and ranking semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL may cause multiple scans of base_agg (9 times), potentially slower than single ROLLUP.
  - Must ensure NULLs are inserted correctly for missing grouping columns.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate on q67 (0.85x):
   CAUSE: Materialized dimension filters into CTEs before a ROLLUP aggregation with window functions, preventing the optimizer from pushing aggregation through joins.
   RULE: Avoid creating dimension CTEs that break the ROLLUP and window computation; if using CTEs, keep the ROLLUP within the same CTE as the fact join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly 10 columns: i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, rk.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream, including dimension attributes and surrogate keys for joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Date filter values (1206, 1206+11) must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, ordering, and limit as original.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Creating CTEs may block aggregation pushdown (regression_q67_date_cte_isolate).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: No repeated scans, but opportunity to reduce rows before ROLLUP.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

rollup_to_union_windowing: Replace ROLLUP with explicit UNION ALL of grouping sets. Generate all 9 levels as per ROLLUP hierarchy.
  single_pass_aggregation: Not directly applicable; ignore the CASE WHEN labeling aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
```
[item_sums]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, SUM(ss_net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk GROUP BY ss_item_sk
```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```
[detailed]:
```sql
SELECT net_profit / sales_price AS gross_margin, i_category, i_class, 0 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[category_summary]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, i_category, NULL AS i_class, 1 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0 GROUP BY i_category
```
[grand_total]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, NULL AS i_category, NULL AS i_class, 2 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[all_levels]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM detailed UNION ALL SELECT * FROM category_summary UNION ALL SELECT * FROM grand_total
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy < 2 THEN RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ORDER BY gross_margin ASC) ELSE 1 END AS rank_within_parent FROM all_levels ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100
```

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20)

                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store sales quantity*price under a multi-level ROLLUP, compute rank by descending sumsales within each category, and retain rows with rank <= 100.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim, store, item)
    ├── FILTER (rk <= 100)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_brand ASC, i_product_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, d_moy ASC, s_store_id ASC, sumsales ASC, rk ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
