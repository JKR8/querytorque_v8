You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute gross margin (sum of net profit / sum of extended sales price) for 2002 store sales in 8 selected states at category/class hierarchy levels, and rank classes within each hierarchy parent by ascending margin. All joins are INNER, requiring matches on all dimension tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-insensitive, allowing safe pre-aggregation by item key. Filters on d_year and s_state must be preserved; changing join order must not affect filter application.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex CTE chain may confuse optimizer.
- Pre-aggregation by ss_item_sk must preserve all needed columns for later grouping.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (regression_q67):
   CAUSE: Materialized dimension filters into CTEs before ROLLUP aggregation with window functions, creating barriers that prevent optimizer pushdown.
   RULE: Avoid creating CTE chains that block aggregation pushdown for ROLLUP+window queries.
2. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way fact joins, losing optimizer's ability to reorder joins and push filters.
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact tables when query has multiple fact table joins (not applicable here - single fact table).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (especially ss_item_sk, i_category, i_class, aggregate sums).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must use exact literals: d_year=2002, s_state IN ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with identical ordering (lochierarchy DESC, case, rank_within_parent ASC).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows sequential dimension joins; pre-filtering dimensions into CTEs could reduce fact scan earlier.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: ROLLUP creates implicit hierarchy levels that could be optimized separately.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- prefetch_fact_join: Apply pre-filtering and pre-joining of fact table with dimensions. Ignore single CTE chain.
- rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply explicit UNION ALL of hierarchy levels. Ignore triple fact scan.
- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate aggregation into single pre-aggregation pass. Apply CASE aggregation pattern not needed here.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store

        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')

group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales

```

### 2. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

```

### 3. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `gross_margin`
  2. `i_category`
  3. `i_class`
  4. `lochierarchy`
  5. `rank_within_parent`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with date, item, and store; filter by year and state list; aggregate gross margin under ROLLUP(i_category, i_class); then apply window ranking within hierarchy levels.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim AS d1 (join), item (join), store (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ss_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_year = 2002)
    ├── FILTER (s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH'))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ASC, rank_within_parent ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
