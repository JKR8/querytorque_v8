You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute gross margin (sum of net profit / sum of extended sales price) for 2002 store sales in 8 selected states at category/class hierarchy levels, and rank classes within each hierarchy parent by ascending margin. All joins are INNER, requiring matches on all dimension tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-insensitive, allowing safe pre-aggregation by item key. Filters on d_year and s_state must be preserved; changing join order must not affect filter application.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Triples store_sales scan if base_join is materialized (3 references).
- Window function must handle NULL i_category/i_class correctly.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (regression_q67):
   CAUSE: Materialized dimension filters into CTEs before ROLLUP aggregation with window functions, creating barriers that prevent optimizer pushdown.
   RULE: Avoid creating CTE chains that block aggregation pushdown for ROLLUP+window queries.
2. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way fact joins, losing optimizer's ability to reorder joins and push filters.
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact tables when query has multiple fact table joins (not applicable here - single fact table).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (especially ss_item_sk, i_category, i_class, aggregate sums).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must use exact literals: d_year=2002, s_state IN ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with identical ordering (lochierarchy DESC, case, rank_within_parent ASC).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows sequential dimension joins; pre-filtering dimensions into CTEs could reduce fact scan earlier.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: ROLLUP creates implicit hierarchy levels that could be optimized separately.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- rollup_to_union_windowing: Replace GROUP BY ROLLUP with explicit UNION ALL of pre-aggregated CTEs at each hierarchy level. Apply exactly.
- union_cte_split: Split implicit ROLLUP into explicit levels. Ignore year-based splitting.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')

```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```

```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `gross_margin`
  2. `i_category`
  3. `i_class`
  4. `lochierarchy`
  5. `rank_within_parent`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with date, item, and store; filter by year and state list; aggregate gross margin under ROLLUP(i_category, i_class); then apply window ranking within hierarchy levels.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim AS d1 (join), item (join), store (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ss_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_year = 2002)
    ├── FILTER (s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH'))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ASC, rank_within_parent ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },

    },

    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
