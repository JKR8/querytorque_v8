You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

(a) Return five quantity-bucket metrics where each bucket chooses average extended sales price when bucket volume exceeds a threshold, otherwise average net profit, for store sales tied to reason key 1.
(b) No JOIN semantics - only uncorrelated scalar subqueries and a trivial reason table filter.
(c) AVG() is duplicate-sensitive but disjoint quantity ranges ensure no overlap; COUNT(*) counts all rows in each range.
(d) The r_reason_sk = 1 filter on reason table must be preserved but is trivial; quantity range thresholds (2972190, 4505785, etc.) are literal constants that must remain unchanged.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- 5 CTEs may each be materialized, adding overhead vs single CTE.
- Must ensure cross joins don't create Cartesian explosion (each CTE returns 1 row, so safe).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do NOT convert scalar subqueries to materialized CTEs that scan entire table - focus on consolidating existing scans.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created duplicate CTEs when optimizer already pushed predicates effectively
   RULE: Check EXPLAIN - if scans already have filters pushed (they do), avoid decomposing further.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve bucket1 through bucket5 column names and calculation logic exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must output all columns needed for CASE expression logic.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Quantity thresholds (2972190, 4505785, 1575726, 3188917, 3525216) and range boundaries (1-20, 21-40, etc.) must remain unchanged.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce exactly one row with five bucket values identical to original.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Query exhibits 15 scans of same fact table with similar WHERE patterns.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Scalar subqueries execute independently with no correlation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Apply specialization per bucket range with separate CTEs; ignore year filtering aspect.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply pattern of independent CTEs per "channel" (bucket); ignore shared dimension extraction.
- rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply explicit separation of different aggregation groups; ignore window functions.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with year_total as (
 select c_customer_id customer_id
       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

       ,stddev_samp(ss_net_paid) year_total
       ,'s' sale_type

 union all

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name

       ,'w' sale_type

         and t_s_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_w_firstyear.year = 1999
         and t_w_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and case when t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_w_secyear.year_total / t_w_firstyear.year_total else null end
           > case when t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_s_secyear.year_total / t_s_firstyear.year_total else null end

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `bucket1`
  2. `bucket2`
  3. `bucket3`
  4. `bucket4`
  5. `bucket5`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — For each quantity range (1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100), compute count and conditional average selection via CASE expressions, producing one output row with bucket1 through bucket5.
    ├── SCAN (reason, store_sales (correlated subquery))
    ├── FILTER (r_reason_sk = 1)
    └── OUTPUT (bucket1, bucket2, bucket3, bucket4, bucket5)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
