You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

(a) Return five quantity-bucket metrics where each bucket chooses average extended sales price when bucket volume exceeds a threshold, otherwise average net profit, for store sales tied to reason key 1.
(b) No JOIN semantics - only uncorrelated scalar subqueries and a trivial reason table filter.
(c) AVG() is duplicate-sensitive but disjoint quantity ranges ensure no overlap; COUNT(*) counts all rows in each range.
(d) The r_reason_sk = 1 filter on reason table must be preserved but is trivial; quantity range thresholds (2972190, 4505785, etc.) are literal constants that must remain unchanged.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- MAX(CASE WHEN...) pivot may be less efficient than direct CASE expressions.
- GROUP BY bucket_id computes aggregates correctly but requires pivot to get single row.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines single-pass aggregation with pivot transformation)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do NOT convert scalar subqueries to materialized CTEs that scan entire table - focus on consolidating existing scans.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created duplicate CTEs when optimizer already pushed predicates effectively
   RULE: Check EXPLAIN - if scans already have filters pushed (they do), avoid decomposing further.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve bucket1 through bucket5 column names and calculation logic exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must output all columns needed for CASE expression logic.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Quantity thresholds (2972190, 4505785, 1575726, 3188917, 3525216) and range boundaries (1-20, 21-40, etc.) must remain unchanged.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce exactly one row with five bucket values identical to original.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Query exhibits 15 scans of same fact table with similar WHERE patterns.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Scalar subqueries execute independently with no correlation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply single scan principle; enhance with bucket labeling.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply bucket labeling and GROUP BY; ignore bitmap aspect.
- scan_consolidation_pivot: Apply GROUP BY with discriminator then pivot; this is the core pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `bucket1`
  2. `bucket2`
  3. `bucket3`
  4. `bucket4`
  5. `bucket5`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — For each quantity range (1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100), compute count and conditional average selection via CASE expressions, producing one output row with bucket1 through bucket5.
    ├── SCAN (reason, store_sales (correlated subquery))
    ├── FILTER (r_reason_sk = 1)
    └── OUTPUT (bucket1, bucket2, bucket3, bucket4, bucket5)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
