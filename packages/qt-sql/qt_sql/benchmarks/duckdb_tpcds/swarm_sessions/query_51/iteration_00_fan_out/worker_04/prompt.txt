You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

(a) Business intent: Compare item-level cumulative daily sales between web and store channels over month sequence 1216-1227, returning dates where web cumulative sales exceed store cumulative sales.
(b) JOIN semantics: FULL OUTER JOIN between web and store CTEs on item_sk and d_date preserves rows from both channels even when one channel has no sales on a given day; missing values become NULL.
(c) Aggregation traps: The window function SUM(SUM(...)) OVER computes running totals; the outer SUM OVER is monotonic and grouping-safe. The final MAX OVER carries forward last non-null cumulative value.
(d) Filter dependencies: The date filter d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216+11 must be applied before joining with fact tables; web/item_sk IS NOT NULL filters are redundant but safe.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- DuckDB may not support IGNORE NULLS in window functions; need a fallback using MAX.
- The cumulative values must be computed as running sums of daily aggregates, not carried forward directly.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q51_date_cte_isolate (0.87x):
   CAUSE: Materializing cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before a join that filters on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering.
   RULE: Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates.
2. regression_q31_pushdown (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Keeping both filtered and original CTEs causes redundant materialization and cardinality misestimates.
   RULE: When creating filtered CTEs, remove the original unfiltered CTEs.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Output must include item_sk, d_date, web_sales, store_sales, web_cumulative, store_cumulative.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output item_sk, d_date, and cumulative sales columns referenced downstream.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Date filter values 1216 and 1216+11 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by item_sk, d_date.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter applied twice (once per channel CTE) causing two date_dim scans (365 rows each) in EXPLAIN.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Not applicable; no UNION CTE.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not applicable; each fact table scanned once per channel.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Combine deferred window and shared dimension patterns. Use LAST_VALUE IGNORE NULLS to carry forward cumulative values in a single window pass, eliminating the need for separate MAX windows. If DuckDB doesn't support IGNORE NULLS, fall back to MAX.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

```

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
