You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count store sales occurring at 8:30+ for households with dependent count 3 in store "ese". JOIN semantics are INNER (all four tables must match). Aggregation is COUNT(*) which is duplicate-safe and grouping-insensitive. Filter dependencies: time_dim filters (t_hour=8, t_minute>=30) are independent of household_demographics (hd_dep_count=3) and store (s_store_name='ese'); all must be satisfied via surrogate key joins.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_time -> main_join -> aggregate -> limit
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_time:
    FROM: time_dim
    WHERE: t_hour = 8 AND t_minute >= 30
    OUTPUT: t_time_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1,800
    CONSUMERS: main_join
  main_join:
    FROM: store_sales
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_time ON ss_sold_time_sk = t_time_sk
          INNER JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
          INNER JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE: household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 3 AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
    OUTPUT: (rows for count)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 7,349
    CONSUMERS: aggregate
  aggregate:
    FROM: main_join
    AGGREGATE: COUNT(*) as cnt
    OUTPUT: cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: limit
  limit:
    FROM: aggregate
    ORDER BY: cnt ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1

NODE_CONTRACTS:
filtered_time:
    FROM: time_dim
    WHERE: t_hour = 8 AND t_minute >= 30
    OUTPUT: t_time_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1,800
    CONSUMERS: main_join
  main_join:
    FROM: store_sales
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_time ON ss_sold_time_sk = t_time_sk
          INNER JOIN household_demographics ON ss_hdemo_sk = hd_demo_sk
          INNER JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    WHERE: household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 3 AND store.s_store_name = 'ese'
    OUTPUT: (rows for count)
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 7,349
    CONSUMERS: aggregate
  aggregate:
    FROM: main_join
    AGGREGATE: COUNT(*) as cnt
    OUTPUT: cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: limit
  limit:
    FROM: aggregate
    ORDER BY: cnt ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: cnt
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- May not reduce fact scan significantly if DuckDB already pushes time filter via hash join.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31): CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings. RULE: Our baseline is 301ms, so proceed but minimize CTE overhead.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26): CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion. RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with the fact table.
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25): CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated. RULE: Our baseline is 301ms, so acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Output is COUNT(*) only.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream joins (surrogate keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Filters must preserve t_hour=8, t_minute>=30, hd_dep_count=3, s_store_name='ese' exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Final count must match exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Dimension filters applied after fact scan; fact table sees no predicates.
- EARLY_FILTER_OPPORTUNITY: Small dimension tables (time_dim 1,800 rows, household_demographics 720 rows, store 14 rows) can be pre-filtered.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- date_cte_isolate (Q6): Apply isolation of time filter into CTE; ignore the multiple year filters.
- early_filter (Q11): Apply principle of filtering time first; ignore the reason table.
- pushdown (Q9): Apply pushing time filter into a CTE; ignore the 15+ scalar subqueries pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)

                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5

```

## Original SQL

```sql

select count(*) 
from store_sales
    ,household_demographics 
    ,time_dim, store
where ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk   
    and ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk 
    and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    and time_dim.t_hour = 8
    and time_dim.t_minute >= 30
    and household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 3
    and store.s_store_name = 'ese'
order by count(*)
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 96 in stream 0 using template query96.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `COUNT(*)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with household demographics, time, and store; apply hour/minute, dependent-count, and store-name filters; and return total qualifying row count.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, household_demographics (join), time_dim (join), store (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_hour = 8)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_minute >= 30)
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── SORT (COUNT(*) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
