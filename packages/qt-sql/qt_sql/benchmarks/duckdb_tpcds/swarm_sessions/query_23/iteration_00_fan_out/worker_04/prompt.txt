You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Estimate May 2000 cross-channel demand from high-value store customers by summing catalog and web sales for items that were frequently sold in stores during 2000-2003. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (implied by WHERE equality). Aggregation traps: Only SUM and COUNT used, all duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: CTEs use d_year IN (2000-2003); main query filters to d_year=2000 AND d_moy=5; cannot push May filter into CTEs.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Early UNION ALL may force materialization of large intermediate result.
- Must ensure date filter (May 2000) is applied before UNION ALL.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This strategy combines proven patterns (channel consolidation, shared dimensions) but applies them in novel combination for this query structure.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime under 100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: If baseline <100ms, avoid creating additional CTEs.
2. union_cte_split (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting, remove original UNION CTE entirely.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Never convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year values (2000,2001,2002,2003) and d_moy=5 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with c_last_name, c_first_name, sales.
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, sales for second query; sum(sales) for first.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced downstream (item_sk, c_customer_sk, etc.).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows CTEs computed independently with 2000-2003 filter, main query filters to May 2000 separately.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned 3x with same date range (2000-2003).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Consolidate catalog and web scans into single UNION ALL with channel label. Apply fully.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Share dimension CTEs (items, customers) across both channels. Apply fully.
- union_cte_split: Create single CTE for all sales data. Apply but keep UNION ALL inside CTE.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUM(sales)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
