You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Estimate May 2000 cross-channel demand from high-value store customers by summing catalog and web sales for items that were frequently sold in stores during 2000-2003. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER (implied by WHERE equality). Aggregation traps: Only SUM and COUNT used, all duplicate-safe. Filter dependencies: CTEs use d_year IN (2000-2003); main query filters to d_year=2000 AND d_moy=5; cannot push May filter into CTEs.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The HAVING clause in top_customers_cte references a max over the same CTE (circular). Must compute max in separate subquery.
- GROUP BY columns must include all non-aggregated columns from consolidated_store_sales.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime under 100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: If baseline <100ms, avoid creating additional CTEs.
2. union_cte_split (0.49x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting, remove original UNION CTE entirely.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Never convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year values (2000,2001,2002,2003) and d_moy=5 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with c_last_name, c_first_name, sales.
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, sales for second query; sum(sales) for first.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced downstream (item_sk, c_customer_sk, etc.).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows CTEs computed independently with 2000-2003 filter, main query filters to May 2000 separately.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned 3x with same date range (2000-2003).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate 3 store_sales scans into 1 CTE that outputs both customer sales and item counts. Apply to store_sales only.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use CASE to compute multiple aggregates in single pass. Ignore channel aspect (we're consolidating store_sales, not catalog/web).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUM(sales)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] frequent_ss_items  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Identify store items that sell more than four times per day/description slice during 2000-2003 to define the frequent-item set.
│   ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim (join), item (join))
│   ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
