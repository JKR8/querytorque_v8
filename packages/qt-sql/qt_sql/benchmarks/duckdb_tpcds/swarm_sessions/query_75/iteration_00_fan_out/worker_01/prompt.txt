You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare 1999 versus 1998 net unit and sales amount performance for Home-category brand/class/manufacturer combinations across all channels after subtracting returns, keeping combinations with at least 10% unit decline. All joins are INNER except returns (LEFT JOIN) which preserves sales rows even without returns. Aggregation uses SUM with COALESCE for NULL returns, grouping by year + product dimensions. The ratio filter CAST(curr_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))/CAST(prev_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))<0.9 must preserve exact decimal division semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must replicate UNION across both year CTEs (three channels each).
  - Ensure returns LEFT JOIN conditions remain identical.
  - Verify CAST in ratio filter preserves decimal division semantics.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (regression_q74_pushdown 0.68x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION CTE and specialized year CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting CTE by year, ELIMINATE the original all_sales CTE entirely.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (regression_q26 0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each has selective WHERE clause.
3. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined store_sales with date CTE before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact tables when query has 3+ fact table joins needing reorder freedom.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 10 columns in original order: prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any created CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: i_category='Home', d_year=1999, d_year=1998, CAST(AS DECIMAL(17,2)), ratio 0.9.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical 100 rows ordered by sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows CTE scanned twice with year filters applied late (curr_yr.d_year=1999, prev_yr.d_year=1998).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows item scanned 3 times (once per channel), date_dim scanned 3 times.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic CTE with all years self-joined with year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

union_cte_split: Apply year-splitting to all_sales CTE; create all_sales_1998 and all_sales_1999. Ignore the decorrelation aspect — no correlated subqueries.
  pushdown: Push year filter into each channel subquery (d_year=1998/1999). Ignore consolidation of multiple subqueries — keep UNION structure.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with year_total as (

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `prev_year`
  2. `year`
  3. `i_brand_id`
  4. `i_class_id`
  5. `i_category_id`
  6. `i_manufact_id`
  7. `prev_yr_cnt`
  8. `curr_yr_cnt`
  9. `sales_cnt_diff`
  10. `sales_amt_diff`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] all_sales  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build channel-neutral yearly sales count and sales amount metrics by brand/class/category/manufacturer using sales minus returns from catalog, store, and web.
│   ├── SCAN (web_sales, item, date_dim, web_returns, catalog_sales, catalog_returns, store_sales, store_returns)
│   ├── FILTER (i_category = 'Home')
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Join 1999 metrics to 1998 metrics on product keys, compute year-over-year differences, filter to curr/prev sales_cnt ratio below 0.9, and order by declines.
    ├── SCAN (all_sales AS curr_yr (join), all_sales AS prev_yr (join))
    ├── JOIN (curr_yr.i_brand_id = prev_yr.i_brand_id)
    ├── JOIN (curr_yr.i_class_id = prev_yr.i_class_id)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (curr_yr.d_year = 1999)
    ├── FILTER (prev_yr.d_year = 1999 - 1)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (sales_cnt_diff ASC, sales_amt_diff ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
