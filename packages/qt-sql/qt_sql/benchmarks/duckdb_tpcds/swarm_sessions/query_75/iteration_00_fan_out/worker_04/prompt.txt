You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare 1999 versus 1998 net unit and sales amount performance for Home-category brand/class/manufacturer combinations across all channels after subtracting returns, keeping combinations with at least 10% unit decline. All joins are INNER except returns (LEFT JOIN) which preserves sales rows even without returns. Aggregation uses SUM with COALESCE for NULL returns, grouping by year + product dimensions. The ratio filter CAST(curr_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))/CAST(prev_yr.sales_cnt AS DECIMAL(17,2))<0.9 must preserve exact decimal division semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure returns LEFT JOIN doesn't create duplicates within brand/class/category/manufacturer/year group.
  - Verify grouping by d_year preserves correct per-year aggregates.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (regression_q74_pushdown 0.68x):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION CTE and specialized year CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting CTE by year, ELIMINATE the original all_sales CTE entirely.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (regression_q26 0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each has selective WHERE clause.
3. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25 0.50x):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined store_sales with date CTE before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact tables when query has 3+ fact table joins needing reorder freedom.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 10 columns in original order: prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any created CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: i_category='Home', d_year=1999, d_year=1998, CAST(AS DECIMAL(17,2)), ratio 0.9.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical 100 rows ordered by sales_cnt_diff, sales_amt_diff.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows CTE scanned twice with year filters applied late (curr_yr.d_year=1999, prev_yr.d_year=1998).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows item scanned 3 times (once per channel), date_dim scanned 3 times.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic CTE with all years self-joined with year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate year aggregation per channel in single pass (already grouped by year). Ignore CASE pivoting — we keep d_year in GROUP BY.
  channel_bitmap_aggregation: Not directly applicable (different fact tables), but adapt consolidation spirit: aggregate once per channel across both years.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `prev_year`
  2. `year`
  3. `i_brand_id`
  4. `i_class_id`
  5. `i_category_id`
  6. `i_manufact_id`
  7. `prev_yr_cnt`
  8. `curr_yr_cnt`
  9. `sales_cnt_diff`
  10. `sales_amt_diff`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] all_sales  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build channel-neutral yearly sales count and sales amount metrics by brand/class/category/manufacturer using sales minus returns from catalog, store, and web.
│   ├── SCAN (web_sales, item, date_dim, web_returns, catalog_sales, catalog_returns, store_sales, store_returns)
│   ├── FILTER (i_category = 'Home')
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (d_year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, sales_cnt, sales_amt)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Join 1999 metrics to 1998 metrics on product keys, compute year-over-year differences, filter to curr/prev sales_cnt ratio below 0.9, and order by declines.
    ├── SCAN (all_sales AS curr_yr (join), all_sales AS prev_yr (join))
    ├── JOIN (curr_yr.i_brand_id = prev_yr.i_brand_id)
    ├── JOIN (curr_yr.i_class_id = prev_yr.i_class_id)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (curr_yr.d_year = 1999)
    ├── FILTER (prev_yr.d_year = 1999 - 1)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (sales_cnt_diff ASC, sales_amt_diff ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (prev_year, year, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, i_manufact_id, prev_yr_cnt, curr_yr_cnt, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
