You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Rank web net paid totals over month sequence 1224-1235 by item category/class hierarchy, producing rollup-level totals and within-parent rank. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics), requiring matches in all three tables. SUM(ws_net_paid) is duplicate-sensitive; any restructuring must preserve exact row participation in each grouping set. The window function partitions by hierarchy level and category (when class is grouped), with ranking based on descending total_sum within each partition.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must compute GROUPING() equivalents manually via constants (0/1) for each level.
- The window function partition logic must match original: partition by (grouping_category+grouping_class) and (CASE WHEN grouping_class=0 THEN i_category END).
- UNION ALL may change row order; must enforce final ORDER BY.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q67_date_cte_isolate (0.85x):
   CAUSE: Materialized dimension filters into CTEs before ROLLUP aggregation with window functions, creating materialization barriers that prevented optimizer pushdown.
   RULE: Avoid materializing CTEs between dimension filters and ROLLUP aggregation when window functions are computed on the aggregated result.
2. regression_q25_date_cte_isolate (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and joined fact table to date CTE before multi-way fact joins, losing optimizer reordering freedom.
   RULE: For simple 3-table star joins (fact + 2 dims), avoid forced CTE join ordering that prevents optimizer from choosing optimal plan.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output total_sum, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: ws_net_paid, i_category, i_class, d_date_sk, ws_sold_date_sk, i_item_sk, ws_item_sk.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224+11 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce identical rows, grouping sets, and ranking as original ROLLUP.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: ROLLUP creates multiple grouping levels that could be split into UNION ALL branches for per-level optimization.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter is already pushed down; opportunity for dimension pre-filtering CTEs exists.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Only one web_sales scan, but could pre-aggregate to reduce 1.4M input to aggregation.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply the explicit UNION ALL of three grouping levels (both, category-only, grand-total). Ignore any year-specific filtering as this query doesn't have that.
- union_cte_split: Adapt the idea of splitting a generic CTE into specialized ones for each grouping level. Ignore the year filter specialization.
- single_pass_aggregation: Use the concept of pre-aggregating at the leaf level (level2_agg) before computing higher levels, but here we compute each level separately from the base joined data.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')

```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```

```sql
SELECT net_profit / sales_price AS gross_margin, i_category, i_class, 0 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```

```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

### 3. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `total_sum`
  2. `i_category`
  3. `i_class`
  4. `lochierarchy`
  5. `rank_within_parent`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with date and item, aggregate ws_net_paid under ROLLUP(i_category, i_class), and apply hierarchy-aware ranking by descending total_sum.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim AS d1 (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ws_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ASC, rank_within_parent ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (total_sum, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
