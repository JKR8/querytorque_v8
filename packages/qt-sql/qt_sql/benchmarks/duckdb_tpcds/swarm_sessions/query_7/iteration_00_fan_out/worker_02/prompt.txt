You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute per-item average purchase metrics for 2001 store sales to female, widowed, college-educated customers under promotions with email or event channel disabled. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all dimension tables. Aggregates are AVG over quantity, list price, coupon amount, and sales price; join-induced duplication must be avoided (foreign-key joins preserve cardinality). The OR condition on promotion channels must preserve NULL-handling: rows where p_channel_email or p_channel_event are NULL are excluded by the OR.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Deduplication required if a promotion row satisfies both channel conditions (email='N' and event='N'). Use DISTINCT on store_sales key before or after UNION.
- Each branch rescans store_sales entirely (345.6M rows), potentially doubling scan cost. Mitigate by pushing date filter into each branch? But date filter is after union in original plan. Consider pushing date join into each branch.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (Q31, 0.49x):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms; CTE materialization overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 707ms, so CTE overhead is acceptable.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (Q26, 0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.
3. or_to_union (Q90, 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Our OR is on different columns (p_channel_email vs p_channel_event), safe to split.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, avg(ss_quantity), avg(ss_list_price), avg(ss_coupon_amt), avg(ss_sales_price).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (foreign keys, grouping columns, aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Filters 'F', 'W', 'College', 'N', 2001 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must be identical in rows, columns, and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date range predicate not pushed into store_sales scan (EXPLAIN shows store_sales scan without filter).
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR on p_channel_email and p_channel_event spans different columns; could be split into UNION ALL.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- or_to_union: Apply splitting OR into UNION ALL branches; ignore the warning about same-column OR (our OR is on different columns). Must handle deduplication if a promotion satisfies both conditions.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl
select i_item_id, 
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
        avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
        avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
 from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'F' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'W' and
       cd_education_status = 'College' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `agg1`
  3. `agg2`
  4. `agg3`
  5. `agg4`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter store sales by customer demographics, promotion-channel flags, and year; then aggregate item-level average purchase metrics and return items in id order.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), item (join), promotion (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status = 'W')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
