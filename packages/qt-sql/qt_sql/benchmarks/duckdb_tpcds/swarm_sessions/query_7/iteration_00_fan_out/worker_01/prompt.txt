You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute per-item average purchase metrics for 2001 store sales to female, widowed, college-educated customers under promotions with email or event channel disabled. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in all dimension tables. Aggregates are AVG over quantity, list price, coupon amount, and sales price; join-induced duplication must be avoided (foreign-key joins preserve cardinality). The OR condition on promotion channels must preserve NULL-handling: rows where p_channel_email or p_channel_event are NULL are excluded by the OR.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure the BETWEEN subqueries on date_cte do not cause correlated execution; consider extracting MIN/MAX into scalar CTE.
- All dimension CTEs must be referenced only once to avoid materialization overhead.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (Q31, 0.49x):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms; CTE materialization overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 707ms, so CTE overhead is acceptable.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (Q26, 0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.
3. or_to_union (Q90, 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Our OR is on different columns (p_channel_email vs p_channel_event), safe to split.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, avg(ss_quantity), avg(ss_list_price), avg(ss_coupon_amt), avg(ss_sales_price).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (foreign keys, grouping columns, aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Filters 'F', 'W', 'College', 'N', 2001 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must be identical in rows, columns, and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date range predicate not pushed into store_sales scan (EXPLAIN shows store_sales scan without filter).
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR on p_channel_email and p_channel_event spans different columns; could be split into UNION ALL.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply pre-filtering of all dimension tables into CTEs; ignore the cross-join warning (we join sequentially).
- prefetch_fact_join: Apply the CTE chain that filters dimensions first, then join with fact table; ignore the multiple fact table chains (we have only store_sales).
- date_cte_isolate: Apply extracting date filter into CTE and using date key range; ignore the decomposition warning (baseline >100ms).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 3. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl
select i_item_id, 
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
        avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
        avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
 from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       ss_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'F' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'W' and
       cd_education_status = 'College' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `agg1`
  3. `agg2`
  4. `agg3`
  5. `agg4`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter store sales by customer demographics, promotion-channel flags, and year; then aggregate item-level average purchase metrics and return items in id order.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), item (join), promotion (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status = 'W')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
