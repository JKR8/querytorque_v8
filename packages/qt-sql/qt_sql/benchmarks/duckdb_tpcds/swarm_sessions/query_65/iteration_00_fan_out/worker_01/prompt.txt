You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: For month sequence 1221-1232, find store-item pairs whose revenue is at most 10% of that store's average item revenue, with store/item descriptive fields. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER intersections (store_sales ↔ date_dim, store ↔ store_sales, item ↔ store_sales). Aggregation trap: The per-store average (sb.ave) is AVG over per-store-item revenues; changing row duplication (e.g., from join reordering) would alter the average. Filter dependencies: The date filter (d_month_seq 1221-1232) must be applied identically to both revenue computations; the revenue filter (<= 0.1 * ave) depends on the store-level average.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Ensure store_avg is computed from store_item_revenue (not directly from fact) to match original AVG over per-item sums.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime under 100ms, CTE materialization overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 3281ms, so acceptable.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline under 50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 3281ms, acceptable.
3. multi_dimension_prefetch (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead.
   RULE: Ensure every dimension CTE has a WHERE clause (date filter already selective).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output s_store_name, i_item_desc, revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand in original order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced by downstream joins, filters, or output.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literals 1221, 1221+11, 0.1 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must be identical to original (100 rows ordered by s_store_name, i_item_desc).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows two SEQ_SCAN on store_sales (259.0ms + 250.1ms) for identical date range.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter repeated in two subqueries; could be shared.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of two store_sales scans into one CTE (date_filtered_sales) that feeds both aggregates. Ignore the CASE conditional aggregation aspect — we don't need per-channel labeling.
  channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply the principle of merging repeated fact scans into a single scan. Ignore the bitmap and channel-specific buckets.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `revenue`
  4. `i_current_price`
  5. `i_wholesale_cost`
  6. `i_brand`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute per-store average item revenue and per-store-item revenue over the same 12-month window, filter low-revenue pairs by the 10% threshold, and join store/item dimensions for output.
    ├── SCAN (store, item (join), store_sales (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (sb.ss_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = sc.ss_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (sc.revenue <= 0.1 * sb.ave)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC, i_item_desc ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, i_item_desc, revenue, i_current_price, i_wholesale_cost, i_brand)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
