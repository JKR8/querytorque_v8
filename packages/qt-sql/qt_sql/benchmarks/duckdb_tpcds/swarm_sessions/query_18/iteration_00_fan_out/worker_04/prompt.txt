You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: For 1998 catalog sales to female customers with advanced degrees and selected birth months in selected states, compute grouped averages of sales/customer metrics with rollups over item and geography. All joins are INNER, requiring matches across all tables. The aggregates are simple AVG over decimal-cast columns; duplication from joins would skew AVG, so row multiplicity must be preserved exactly as the original star join. The c_birth_month and ca_state IN-list filters are independent per table; moving them earlier cannot be lost.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pushing aggregation before joining item changes group membership because item_sk may have multiple i_item_id? No, item_sk is unique to i_item_id, so grouping by cs_item_sk is equivalent to grouping by i_item_id. However, ROLLUP after joining item will produce additional groups? Actually, ROLLUP is over i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county. If we aggregate by cs_item_sk (surrogate key) and then join item, we have i_item_id. The ROLLUP can be performed after the join without issue because the groups are the same.
- But the aggregates are already computed per (cs_item_sk, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county). Rolling up further (e.g., to (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state)) requires averaging the already-averaged values? That is incorrect. We must not pre-aggregate before the ROLLUP. This strategy is risky.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This strategy attempts to push aggregation before joining item, but ROLLUP requires aggregation at multiple levels. Pre-aggregating at the lowest level and then rolling up is mathematically correct only if the rollup is a further aggregation of the same base rows. However, if we pre-aggregate by (cs_item_sk, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county), then rolling up to (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state) would require averaging the pre-aggregated averages weighted by count. This is complex and likely incorrect. Therefore, we must not pre-aggregate before the ROLLUP. Instead, we can defer the item join but keep all base rows. Let's adjust: fact_agg should not aggregate; it should output base rows. Then join item, then rollup. That's just the original star join with CTEs. So we revert to that.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms; CTE materialization overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: Skip if baseline <100ms. Our baseline is 1521ms, so safe.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined fact table before multi-way fact joins, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (catalog_sales), no multi-way fact joins, so safe.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; join dimensions sequentially via fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, and 7 AVG aggregates.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: surrogate keys for joins, plus display/aggregation columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal filters: cd1.cd_gender='F', cd1.cd_education_status='Advanced Degree', c_birth_month IN (10,7,8,4,1,2), d_year=1998, ca_state IN ('WA','GA','NC','ME','WY','OK','IN').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match original row-for-row, including ROLLUP groups and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Filters are currently pushed into dimension scans but the fact table scan remains unfiltered; pre-filtering dimensions into CTEs could enable earlier reduction.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scanned once; no redundant scans to eliminate.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: No correlated subqueries present.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- deferred_window_aggregation: Delay item join until after aggregation; ignore window functions.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Pre-filter dimensions; ignore that aggregation is pushed before item join.
- prefetch_fact_join: Use CTE chain; ignore that aggregation is pushed down.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

```

### 2. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```

```sql

```
[joined_facts]:
```sql

```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 3. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `ca_country`
  3. `ca_state`
  4. `ca_county`
  5. `agg1`
  6. `agg2`
  7. `agg3`
  8. `agg4`
  9. `agg5`
  10. `agg6`
  11. `agg7`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
