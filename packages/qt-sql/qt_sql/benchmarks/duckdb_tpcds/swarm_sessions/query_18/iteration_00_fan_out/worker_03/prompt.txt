You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: For 1998 catalog sales to female customers with advanced degrees and selected birth months in selected states, compute grouped averages of sales/customer metrics with rollups over item and geography. All joins are INNER, requiring matches across all tables. The aggregates are simple AVG over decimal-cast columns; duplication from joins would skew AVG, so row multiplicity must be preserved exactly as the original star join. The c_birth_month and ca_state IN-list filters are independent per table; moving them earlier cannot be lost.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure NULL placeholders for rolled-up columns match ROLLUP semantics (NULL for aggregated-out columns).
- The base_data CTE must be referenced multiple times; ensure it's materialized to avoid repeated joins.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms; CTE materialization overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: Skip if baseline <100ms. Our baseline is 1521ms, so safe.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined fact table before multi-way fact joins, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (catalog_sales), no multi-way fact joins, so safe.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; join dimensions sequentially via fact table.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, and 7 AVG aggregates.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: surrogate keys for joins, plus display/aggregation columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal filters: cd1.cd_gender='F', cd1.cd_education_status='Advanced Degree', c_birth_month IN (10,7,8,4,1,2), d_year=1998, ca_state IN ('WA','GA','NC','ME','WY','OK','IN').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match original row-for-row, including ROLLUP groups and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Filters are currently pushed into dimension scans but the fact table scan remains unfiltered; pre-filtering dimensions into CTEs could enable earlier reduction.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scanned once; no redundant scans to eliminate.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: No correlated subqueries present.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- rollup_to_union_windowing: Replace ROLLUP with explicit UNION ALL of each grouping level; ignore the windowing aspect—this query doesn't need window functions.
- single_pass_aggregation: Compute all aggregates in a single pass per level; ignore the consolidation of multiple fact scans.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Not applicable; ignore the CASE labeling.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `ca_country`
  3. `ca_state`
  4. `ca_county`
  5. `agg1`
  6. `agg2`
  7. `agg3`
  8. `agg4`
  9. `agg5`
  10. `agg6`
  11. `agg7`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales to item, date, customer, two demographic roles, and address; enforce demographic, birth-month, year, and state filters; then compute average metric columns and output ROLLUP totals across item/country/state/county.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, customer_demographics AS cd1 (join), customer_demographics AS cd2 (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+4 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd1.cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd1.cd_education_status = 'Advanced Degree')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_country ASC, ca_state ASC, ca_county ASC, i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, ca_country, ca_state, ca_county, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
