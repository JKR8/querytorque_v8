**Change markers explained:**
- `[+]` ctr_with_avg: New CTE replaces original correlated subquery with window function to compute state average.
- `[~]` main_filter: Changed FROM clause to use new CTE (ctr_with_avg) instead of original CTE (customer_total_return) and removed correlated subquery filter.
- `[~]` top_n: Changed FROM clause to use main_filter CTE.

**Changes:** Replaced the correlated subquery with a window function that computes the state average in a single pass over the grouped data, then multiplies by 1.2 to get the threshold. This eliminates N re-scans of the aggregated data per state.

**Expected speedup:** 2-3× due to eliminating correlated subquery execution per outer row and enabling single-pass aggregation.
