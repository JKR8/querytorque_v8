**Changes:** Restructured original correlated subquery into two CTEs (ctr_aggregate → state_avg) using decorrelation pattern, then joined in main query with explicit INNER JOINs. This eliminates per-state re-execution of the correlated subquery.

**Expected speedup:** 2-4x due to single-pass computation of state averages instead of per-row subquery execution.
