**Change markers:**
- `[!]` New `filtered_customer` CTE added to pre-filter Indiana customers with current address join.
- `[~]` Modified `main_join_with_subquery` to consume `filtered_customer` instead of raw `customer` + `customer_address` join. Removed redundant `customer_address` join and `ca_state = 'IN'` filter (now pushed upstream).

**Changes:** Added `filtered_customer` CTE to pre-join customer with current address and filter `ca_state='IN'` early, reducing the probe side of the main join from 2M customers to ~3.6K Indiana customers. This allows the large `ctr_aggregate` CTE (132K rows) to join against a much smaller filtered customer set.

**Expected speedup:** ~3–4x based on similar early-filter patterns where dimension pre-filtering reduces fact-table probe size by 2–3 orders of magnitude. The correlated subquery still executes per outer row, but the outer row count is reduced from ~132K to ~913 after the join and filter.
