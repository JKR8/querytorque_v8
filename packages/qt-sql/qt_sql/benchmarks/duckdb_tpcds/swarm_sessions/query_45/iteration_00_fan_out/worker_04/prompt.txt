You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum Q2 2000 web sales by customer ZIP and city for customers selected by either a target ZIP prefix list or purchases of items in a designated key-item set. All joins are INNER, requiring matching rows in all dimension tables. The only aggregate is SUM(ws_sales_price), which is duplicate-sensitive; a single sale must not be counted twice if it satisfies both OR conditions. The OR filter depends on customer_address.ca_zip and item.i_item_id via a subquery on i_item_sk.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CASE evaluation overhead may be negligible, but must ensure correctness: a row matching both conditions will have both zip_sales and item_sales equal to ws_sales_price, but we sum ws_sales_price only once.
- The WHERE clause must exclude rows that match neither condition.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Only split OR on different tables/columns; ensure each branch has selective filters.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; use OR or UNION to combine.
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50 ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Baseline 330 ms > 100 ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output ca_zip, ca_city, sum(ws_sales_price) in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., ws_sales_price, ca_zip, ca_city, join keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: ZIP list, i_item_sk list, d_qoy=2, d_year=2000.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, same sums, same ordering.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR spans customer_address and item tables, preventing optimal scan path (EXPLAIN shows MARK joins after fact join).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs in original; predicates on customer_address and item are applied late after large joins.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

channel_bitmap_aggregation: Consolidate two conditions into a single scan with CASE expressions. Ignore bucket limit — we have only two conditions.
  single_pass_aggregation: Use CASE inside aggregates to avoid double-counting. Ignore repeated scans — we have one scan.
  early_filter: Filter dimensions early (date_cte, zip_customers, item_filtered).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

### 3. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_zip`
  2. `ca_city`
  3. `SUM(ws_sales_price)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with customer/address/date/item, apply the OR-based geography-or-item filter, restrict to 2000 Q2, and aggregate sales by ZIP and city.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, customer (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (? op i_item_id)
    ├── FILTER (d_qoy = 2)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_zip ASC, ca_city ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ca_zip, ca_city, SUM(ws_sales_price))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
