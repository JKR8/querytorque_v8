You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare average quantities across store sales, store returns, and catalog sales for matched customer-item flows anchored on April 1999 store sales, grouped by item and store. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches across all three fact tables. AVG is duplicate-sensitive - any restructuring must preserve row-level join cardinality. The date_dim aliases (d1, d2, d3) have independent filters that must remain separated and cannot be combined due to different temporal windows.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- item_cte has no WHERE clause (102K rows) - may add overhead without selectivity benefit
  - Complex 8-way join in fact_join_all may challenge optimizer's join ordering

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (regression_q25_date_cte_isolate):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered store_sales with date CTE before 3-way fact join, losing optimizer's ability to reorder multi-way joins
   RULE: Avoid materializing fact-date CTEs before the multi-way fact table join in queries with 3+ fact tables
2. dimension_cte_isolate (regression_q67_date_cte_isolate):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead without selectivity benefit
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause that actually reduces rows

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_store_id, s_store_name, store_sales_quantity, store_returns_quantity, catalog_sales_quantity
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_item_sk, ss_customer_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_store_sk, sr_item_sk, sr_customer_sk, cs_item_sk, cs_bill_customer_sk for downstream joins
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d1.d_moy=4, d1.d_year=1999, d2.d_moy BETWEEN 4 AND 7, d2.d_year=1999, d3.d_year IN (1999,2000,2001)
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 4 rows with same averages
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Three date_dim aliases with different filters create opportunity for early reduction
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scans 8.5M rows unfiltered - opportunity to pre-filter with d3

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the pattern of pre-filtering ALL dimension tables (date_dim for d1/d2/d3, store, item) into separate CTEs before the main fact table join. Ignore any cross-join or Cartesian explosion risks - this query joins them through fact tables.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `s_store_id`
  4. `s_store_name`
  5. `store_sales_quantity`
  6. `store_returns_quantity`
  7. `catalog_sales_quantity`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join April 1999 store sales to related returns in the following 4-month window and to catalog sales for the same customer/item across 1999-2001, then compute channel-specific average quantities by item/store.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), catalog_sales (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), store (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ss_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+8 more)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_moy = 4)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_year = 1999)
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC, i_item_desc ASC, s_store_id ASC, s_store_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_store_id, s_store_name, store_sales_quantity, store_returns_quantity, catalog_sales_quantity)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
