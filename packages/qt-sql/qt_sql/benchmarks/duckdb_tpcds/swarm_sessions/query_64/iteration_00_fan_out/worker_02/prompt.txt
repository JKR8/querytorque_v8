You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Compare year-over-year store sales (2001 vs 2002) for items whose catalog net sales exceed twice their refunds, under demographic/address/item constraints. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER except the main self-join which is also INNER (intersection). Aggregation traps: No STDDEV_SAMP or FILTER clauses; SUM/COUNT are duplicate-safe but ensure item filter pushdown doesn't break HAVING logic. Filter dependencies: cs_ui HAVING depends on catalog aggregates; cross_sales filters (cd1≠cd2, i_color, price) must preserve marital status inequality.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ELIMINATE the original cross_sales CTE to avoid redundant materialization (regression warning).
- Ensure d2 and d3 filters (date ranges) remain in each year CTE; they are independent of d1 year.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 3175ms >> 100ms, so safe.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reorder.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (store_sales) in cross_sales, no multi-fact join.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting cross_sales by year, ELIMINATE the original generic CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 30+ output columns from original SELECT.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: cross_sales CTE must include all GROUP BY columns plus aggregates for main query self-join.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep exact literal values (i_color list, price 23+10, years 2001/2002).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: cs_ui lacks item filter; cross_sales lacks year filter.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: cross_sales CTE scanned twice with year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Apply by splitting cross_sales into year-specific CTEs (2001, 2002). Ignore the UNION aspect — we're not merging results.
- multi_date_range_cte: Apply by filtering d1 for specific year in each CTE. Ignore creating separate CTEs for d2/d3 — keep them joined inline.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply by reusing cs_ui CTE across both year CTEs. Ignore the multi-channel aspect — we have single channel.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name

         and t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0

### 2. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `product_name`
  2. `store_name`
  3. `store_zip`
  4. `b_street_number`
  5. `b_street_name`
  6. `b_city`
  7. `b_zip`
  8. `c_street_number`
  9. `c_street_name`
  10. `c_city`
  11. `c_zip`
  12. `syear`
  13. `cnt`
  14. `s11`
  15. `s21`
  16. `s31`
  17. `s12`
  18. `s22`
  19. `s32`
  20. `syear`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

├── [CTE] cs_ui  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Identify catalog items whose gross list-price sales exceed twice their refunded/reversed/store-credit return amounts.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
