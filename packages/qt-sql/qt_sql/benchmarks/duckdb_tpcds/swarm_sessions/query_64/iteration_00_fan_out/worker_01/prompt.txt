You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Compare year-over-year store sales (2001 vs 2002) for items whose catalog net sales exceed twice their refunds, under demographic/address/item constraints. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER except the main self-join which is also INNER (intersection). Aggregation traps: No STDDEV_SAMP or FILTER clauses; SUM/COUNT are duplicate-safe but ensure item filter pushdown doesn't break HAVING logic. Filter dependencies: cs_ui HAVING depends on catalog aggregates; cross_sales filters (cd1≠cd2, i_color, price) must preserve marital status inequality.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure cs_ui HAVING still evaluates correctly after joining with filtered_item (no duplicate rows introduced).
- The item price filter has overlapping ranges (23-33 AND 24-38) which simplifies to 24-33. Ensure rewritten filter captures this.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 3175ms >> 100ms, so safe.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reorder.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (store_sales) in cross_sales, no multi-fact join.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting cross_sales by year, ELIMINATE the original generic CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 30+ output columns from original SELECT.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: cross_sales CTE must include all GROUP BY columns plus aggregates for main query self-join.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep exact literal values (i_color list, price 23+10, years 2001/2002).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: cs_ui lacks item filter; cross_sales lacks year filter.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: cross_sales CTE scanned twice with year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply by pushing item filter into cs_ui CTE (consolidate item scan with catalog scan). Ignore the CASE aggregation aspect — we're not merging multiple subqueries.
- star_join_prefetch: Apply by pre-filtering item and cs_ui before joining with store_sales. Ignore the multiple dimension CTE chain — we'll keep all dimension joins together.
- date_cte_isolate: Apply by filtering d1 for years 2001/2002 and date range in prefetched_store_sales. Ignore creating separate date CTE — we'll push filters directly.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 2. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq =

 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state

 order by cnt, a.ca_state

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `product_name`
  2. `store_name`
  3. `store_zip`
  4. `b_street_number`
  5. `b_street_name`
  6. `b_city`
  7. `b_zip`
  8. `c_street_number`
  9. `c_street_name`
  10. `c_city`
  11. `c_zip`
  12. `syear`
  13. `cnt`
  14. `s11`
  15. `s21`
  16. `s31`
  17. `s12`
  18. `s22`
  19. `s32`
  20. `syear`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

├── [CTE] cs_ui  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Identify catalog items whose gross list-price sales exceed twice their refunded/reversed/store-credit return amounts.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
