You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business: Compare year-over-year store sales (2001 vs 2002) for items whose catalog net sales exceed twice their refunds, under demographic/address/item constraints. JOIN semantics: All joins are INNER except the main self-join which is also INNER (intersection). Aggregation traps: No STDDEV_SAMP or FILTER clauses; SUM/COUNT are duplicate-safe but ensure item filter pushdown doesn't break HAVING logic. Filter dependencies: cs_ui HAVING depends on catalog aggregates; cross_sales filters (cd1≠cd2, i_color, price) must preserve marital status inequality.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex CTE structure may confuse optimizer cardinality estimation.
- filtered_dimensions CTE must include all dimension columns needed for GROUP BY and SELECT.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 3175ms >> 100ms, so safe.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer reorder.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (store_sales) in cross_sales, no multi-fact join.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting cross_sales by year, ELIMINATE the original generic CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 30+ output columns from original SELECT.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: cross_sales CTE must include all GROUP BY columns plus aggregates for main query self-join.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep exact literal values (i_color list, price 23+10, years 2001/2002).
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match exactly.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: cs_ui lacks item filter; cross_sales lacks year filter.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: cross_sales CTE scanned twice with year filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- prefetch_fact_join: Apply by creating filtered_dimensions CTE that pre-joins all dimensions except d1, then join with store_sales separately for each year. Ignore the CTE chain length warning — we have only 2 fact CTEs.
- union_cte_split: Apply by creating separate fact CTEs for 2001 and 2002. Ignore the UNION aspect.
- deferred_window_aggregation: Not applicable (no window functions), but inspiration: defer dimension attribute binding until after fact aggregation? Actually we're binding early.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**

### 3. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `product_name`
  2. `store_name`
  3. `store_zip`
  4. `b_street_number`
  5. `b_street_name`
  6. `b_city`
  7. `b_zip`
  8. `c_street_number`
  9. `c_street_name`
  10. `c_city`
  11. `c_zip`
  12. `syear`
  13. `cnt`
  14. `s11`
  15. `s21`
  16. `s31`
  17. `s12`
  18. `s22`
  19. `s32`
  20. `syear`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] cs_ui  [=]  Cost: 33%  Rows: ~1K  — Identify catalog items whose gross list-price sales exceed twice their refunded/reversed/store-credit return amounts.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
