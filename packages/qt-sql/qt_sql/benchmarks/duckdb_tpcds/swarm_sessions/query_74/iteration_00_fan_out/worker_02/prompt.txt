You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers whose year-over-year increase in web-payment variability (1999→2000) exceeds their store-payment variability increase. INNER JOIN semantics require customers to have both store and web sales in both years with positive variability. STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 non-NULL values per (customer, year, channel) group; changing group membership breaks equivalence. Filter dependencies: year=1999 and year=2000 filters must stay with their respective aggregates; positive year_total checks must remain after aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must remove original year_total CTE entirely to avoid redundant scans.
- Each specialized CTE must include all output columns (including year literal).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Created year-specific CTEs but kept original UNION CTE, causing redundant materialization and cardinality errors.
   RULE: When splitting UNION CTE by year, REMOVE the original union CTE entirely.
2. pushdown (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered AND original versions of same aggregations, doubling materialization.
   RULE: When creating filtered CTEs, remove unfiltered originals used in same self-join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (customer_id, first_name, last_name, year, sale_type, year_total).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values 1999, 2000, 's', 'w'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Row count and ordering must match exactly.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Store_sales and web_sales scanned twice each (EXPLAIN shows separate SEQ_SCAN nodes).
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic year_total CTE scanned 4 times with different year/channel filters (EXPLAIN shows separate expansions).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Year filters inside CTE cause repeated scans (EXPLAIN shows same fact table scanned multiple times).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Split generic CTE into year/channel-specific CTEs; ignore the union aspect as we create separate CTEs not a union.
- multi_date_range_cte: Create separate date-filtered CTEs for each year; apply to both store and web channels.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

### 2. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] year_total  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute per-customer yearly standard deviation of net paid for store and web channels in 1999 and 2000.
│   ├── SCAN (customer, store_sales (join), date_dim (join), web_sales (join))
│   ├── JOIN (c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── FILTER (d_year IN (1999, 1999 + 1))
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join customer/channel/year variability rows, require positive 1999 variability baselines, compare web versus store year-over-year ratios, and return matching customer names.
    ├── SCAN (year_total AS t_s_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_s_secyear (join), year_total AS t_w_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_w_secyear (join))

    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's')
    ├── FILTER (t_w_firstyear.sale_type = 'w')
    ├── FILTER (+9 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
