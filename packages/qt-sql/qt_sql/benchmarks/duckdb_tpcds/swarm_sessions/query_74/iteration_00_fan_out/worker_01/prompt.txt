You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers whose year-over-year increase in web-payment variability (1999→2000) exceeds their store-payment variability increase. INNER JOIN semantics require customers to have both store and web sales in both years with positive variability. STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 non-NULL values per (customer, year, channel) group; changing group membership breaks equivalence. Filter dependencies: year=1999 and year=2000 filters must stay with their respective aggregates; positive year_total checks must remain after aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure GROUP BY includes d_year so STDDEV_SAMP is computed per-year.
- The main_join must filter to specific years after aggregation (cannot use conditional aggregation for ratios).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Created year-specific CTEs but kept original UNION CTE, causing redundant materialization and cardinality errors.
   RULE: When splitting UNION CTE by year, REMOVE the original union CTE entirely.
2. pushdown (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered AND original versions of same aggregations, doubling materialization.
   RULE: When creating filtered CTEs, remove unfiltered originals used in same self-join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (customer_id, first_name, last_name, year, sale_type, year_total).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values 1999, 2000, 's', 'w'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Row count and ordering must match exactly.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Store_sales and web_sales scanned twice each (EXPLAIN shows separate SEQ_SCAN nodes).
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic year_total CTE scanned 4 times with different year/channel filters (EXPLAIN shows separate expansions).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Year filters inside CTE cause repeated scans (EXPLAIN shows same fact table scanned multiple times).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple year scans into single GROUP BY with year column; ignore the CASE aggregation pattern because we need per-year STDDEV_SAMP.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply single scan per channel for both years; ignore bitmap technique as we use regular GROUP BY.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] year_total  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute per-customer yearly standard deviation of net paid for store and web channels in 1999 and 2000.
│   ├── SCAN (customer, store_sales (join), date_dim (join), web_sales (join))
│   ├── JOIN (c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── FILTER (d_year IN (1999, 1999 + 1))
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join customer/channel/year variability rows, require positive 1999 variability baselines, compare web versus store year-over-year ratios, and return matching customer names.
    ├── SCAN (year_total AS t_s_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_s_secyear (join), year_total AS t_w_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_w_secyear (join))

    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's')
    ├── FILTER (t_w_firstyear.sale_type = 'w')
    ├── FILTER (+9 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
