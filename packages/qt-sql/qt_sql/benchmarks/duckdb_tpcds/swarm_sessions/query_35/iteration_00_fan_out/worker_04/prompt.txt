You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Profile household dependent metrics by state and customer demographics for customers who purchased in-store during 2001 Q1-Q3 AND also purchased via web OR catalog in the same period. JOINs are INNER (all must match) with EXISTS semi-joins. Aggregation traps: MAX(cd_dep_count) appears twice (lines 7,9) - must preserve duplicate outputs. Filter dependencies: date_dim filters (d_year=2001, d_qoy<4) must apply identically across all sales channels.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
date_range → store_customers → web_catalog_intersect → base_tables_join → group_by  
NODE_CONTRACTS:

    SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk FROM catalog_sales JOIN date_range ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION may change NULL handling vs OR-EXISTS  
- Requires testing edge cases with NULL customer keys

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Materialized EXISTS (0.14x):  
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE destroys semi-join short-circuit  
   RULE: Preserve EXISTS as semi-joins; use WHERE c.c_customer_sk IN (precomputed_keys)  
2. Orphaned CTE (0.49x):  
   CAUSE: Keeping original subquery alongside new CTE causes double materialization  
   RULE: Remove original EXISTS after CTE replacement

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 19 output columns including duplicate MAX()  
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Downstream GROUP BY references cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count  
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: d_year=2001 and d_qoy<4 must remain unchanged  
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: EXISTS semi-join semantics critical for customer filtering  
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS (P2): EXPLAIN shows DELIM_SCAN for sales subqueries  
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS (P0): Q-Error=ZERO_EST at CTE boundary

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- intersect_to_exists: Replace OR with UNION (set operation)  
- multi_intersect_exists_cte: Use date_range in all CTEs

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_state`
  2. `cd_gender`
  3. `cd_marital_status`
  4. `cd_dep_count`
  5. `cnt1`
  6. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  7. `SUM(cd_dep_count)`
  8. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  9. `cd_dep_employed_count`
  10. `cnt2`
  11. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  12. `SUM(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  13. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  14. `cd_dep_college_count`
  15. `cnt3`
  16. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`
  17. `SUM(cd_dep_college_count)`
  18. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 95%  Rows: ~3.1M  — Join customer/address/demographics, enforce multi-channel purchase existence constraints for 2001 quarters 1-3, then group by geography and demographic dependent-count attributes to compute counts/sums/max statistics.
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (EXISTS(SELECT * FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_state ASC, cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_dep_count ASC, cd_dep_employed_count ASC, cd_dep_college_count ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
