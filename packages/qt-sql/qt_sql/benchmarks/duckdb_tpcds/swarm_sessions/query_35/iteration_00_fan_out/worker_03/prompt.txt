You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Profile household dependent metrics by state and demographics for customers who made store purchases in 2001 Q1-Q3 AND also purchased via web OR catalog in same period. JOIN semantics: INNER joins between customer/address/demographics require all three matches; EXISTS conditions act as semi-joins (customer must have at least one matching sale). Aggregation traps: COUNT(*), MAX, SUM on demographic counts are duplicate-safe (row multiplication from joins doesn't change results). Filter dependencies: d_year=2001 AND d_qoy<4 must apply to ALL three sales channels; customer must satisfy store_sales EXISTS AND (web_sales EXISTS OR catalog_sales EXISTS).

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- INTERSECT requires duplicate elimination on full rows (all 7 columns) - expensive
- Three separate customer joins (store, web, catalog) each scan customer table

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (observed regression 0.14x):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan, destroying semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Never convert EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE; preserve as semi-join
2. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR conditions duplicated fact scans without selectivity benefit
   RULE: Only split OR spanning different tables (web vs catalog); never split same-table OR

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly 19 columns as in original SELECT lines 2-19.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include customer_sk for joins and demographic columns for final GROUP BY.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: d_year=2001 and d_qoy<4 must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result set must match original's 100 rows with same ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows date_dim scanned 3x (274 rows each) with same filter - predicate not shared.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR condition spans web_sales and catalog_sales EXISTS on different tables.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

or_to_union: Apply the OR-to-UNION decomposition by splitting web and catalog into separate branches. Ignore the same-column warning — our OR spans different tables (web_sales vs catalog_sales).
  intersect_to_exists: Apply the INTERSECT pattern to represent "store AND (web OR catalog)" as INTERSECT between store_exists and UNION of web/catalog. Ignore the EXISTS conversion — we're using INTERSECT directly.
  date_cte_isolate: Apply the date filter CTE pattern to share across all branches.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

### 2. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

**BEFORE (slow):**

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_state`
  2. `cd_gender`
  3. `cd_marital_status`
  4. `cd_dep_count`
  5. `cnt1`
  6. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  7. `SUM(cd_dep_count)`
  8. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  9. `cd_dep_employed_count`
  10. `cnt2`
  11. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  12. `SUM(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  13. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  14. `cd_dep_college_count`
  15. `cnt3`
  16. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`
  17. `SUM(cd_dep_college_count)`
  18. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join customer/address/demographics, enforce multi-channel purchase existence constraints for 2001 quarters 1-3, then group by geography and demographic dependent-count attributes to compute counts/sums/max statistics.
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (EXISTS(SELECT * FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_state ASC, cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_dep_count ASC, cd_dep_employed_count ASC, cd_dep_college_count ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
