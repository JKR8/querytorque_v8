You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Summarize 30-day performance from 1998-08-05 across store, catalog, and web channels by combining sales, returns, and net profit at channel entity level with rollup subtotals. Store and web channels use LEFT JOIN between sales and returns on entity key (store_sk, web_page_sk); catalog channel uses CROSS JOIN between sales and returns aggregates (potential Cartesian product if key sets differ). All aggregates are SUMs, no duplicate-sensitivity traps. Date filter is identical across all CTEs; dimension tables (store, web_page) are joined only for store and web channels.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must preserve LEFT JOIN semantics: store_combined aggregates both sales and returns per store, but original ss LEFT JOIN sr may have rows with sales but no returns. Our union will include both sides, and aggregation will produce sales and returns even if one side missing (because we union zeros). This matches LEFT JOIN? Actually, LEFT JOIN would have a row for store with sales but no returns, with returns as NULL. Our aggregation will have returns = 0 (because we union zero row for returns? Wait, if a store has sales but no returns, the returns subquery will not contribute any row for that store. So the union will have only sales row, and aggregation will sum returns = 0. That's correct because COALESCE(returns,0) in original. Similarly profit_loss = 0. So it's equivalent.
- For catalog channel, must keep separate cs and cr CTEs and CROSS JOIN them.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and joined fact table before multi-way fact joins, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Do not pre-join fact tables with date CTE if there are multiple fact table joins (this query has no multi-way fact joins, safe).
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline is 486ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact tables.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, id, sales, returns, profit ordered by channel, id with LIMIT 100.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all columns referenced by downstream joins and selects (e.g., s_store_sk, sales, returns, profit_loss).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Date literal '1998-08-05' and interval '30 DAY' must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must preserve LEFT JOIN semantics for store/web channels and CROSS JOIN for catalog channel.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Evidence: date_dim scanned 6 times with same filter (EXPLAIN shows 6 separate SEQ_SCAN date_dim nodes).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (each fact table scanned once).
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Not active.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply conditional aggregation via UNION ALL of fact tables within a channel; ignore the scalar subquery consolidation (not present).
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use CASE WHEN to label sales vs returns within a single scan per fact table? Actually, we are scanning each fact table once, same as original. The consolidation is across fact tables per channel, not across time buckets.
- union_cte_split: Not applicable; ignore the splitting aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `id`
  3. `sales`
  4. `returns`
  5. `profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
