You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return product names from manufacturers 748-788 where at least one item from the same manufacturer matches either of two large OR-pattern attribute bundles across category, color, units, and size. The correlation is an existence check (INNER semantic) that must preserve one-to-many matches. COUNT(*) is safe to replace with EXISTS. The outer i_manufact_id filter must not leak into the subquery's manufacturer matching.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
combined_scan -> distinct_products -> limit
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  combined_scan:
    FROM: item i1 LEFT JOIN LATERAL (SELECT 1 FROM item i2 WHERE i2.i_manufact = i1.i_manufact AND (complex OR condition) LIMIT 1) AS sub ON true
    WHERE: i1.i_manufact_id BETWEEN 748 AND 788 AND sub.column0 IS NOT NULL
    OUTPUT: i1.i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 16
    CONSUMERS: distinct_products
  distinct_products:
    FROM: combined_scan
    GROUP BY: i_product_name
    OUTPUT: i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 16
    CONSUMERS: limit
  limit:
    FROM: distinct_products
    ORDER BY: i_product_name ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ≤100

NODE_CONTRACTS:
combined_scan:
    FROM: item i1 LEFT JOIN LATERAL (SELECT 1 FROM item i2 WHERE i2.i_manufact = i1.i_manufact AND (complex OR condition) LIMIT 1) AS sub ON true
    WHERE: i1.i_manufact_id BETWEEN 748 AND 788 AND sub.column0 IS NOT NULL
    OUTPUT: i1.i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 16
    CONSUMERS: distinct_products
  distinct_products:
    FROM: combined_scan
    GROUP BY: i_product_name
    OUTPUT: i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 16
    CONSUMERS: limit
  limit:
    FROM: distinct_products
    ORDER BY: i_product_name ASC
    LIMIT: 100
    OUTPUT: i_product_name
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ≤100

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- LATERAL may force nested loop join, undoing optimizer's decorrelation.
  - Must ensure LATERAL subquery returns at most one row (LIMIT 1).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (observed regression on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range, doubled fact scans.
   RULE: Do not split same-column ORs; here ORs are on different columns, so safe.
2. materialize_cte (observed regression on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forced full scan.
   RULE: Never convert EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE; here we have COUNT(*) > 0, not EXISTS.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly i_product_name.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include i_manufact for joining and i_product_name for final output.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All string literals in the eight OR patterns must be preserved exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same ≤100 rows ordered by i_product_name.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR spans i_category, i_color, i_units, i_size with eight distinct patterns - splitting may improve predicate evaluation.
- EXISTS_SEMI_JOIN: COUNT(*) > 0 is an existence check; EXISTS may enable early termination.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL: Use LATERAL join for existence check; ignore aggregate computation.
  TOP_N_PER_GROUP_TO_LATERAL: Use LATERAL with LIMIT 1 for existence; ignore top-N grouping.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. CORRELATED_AGGREGATE_TO_LATERAL (unknown)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.name,
             (SELECT SUM(o.amount) FROM orders o 
              WHERE o.customer_id = c.id) AS total_spent
      FROM customers c;
```

### 2. TOP_N_PER_GROUP_TO_LATERAL (unknown)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
SELECT c.id, c.name,
             (SELECT o.order_id FROM orders o 
              WHERE o.customer_id = c.id 
              ORDER BY o.order_date DESC LIMIT 1) AS latest_order
      FROM customers c;
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `(i_product_name)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — For each candidate item, run a correlated count over same-manufacturer items that satisfy the complex attribute bundles, keep manufacturers with count>0, and output distinct product names ordered alphabetically.
    ├── SCAN (item AS i1 (join), item (correlated subquery))
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id BETWEEN 748 AND 748 + 40)
    ├── FILTER ((SELECT COUNT(*) AS item_cnt FROM item WHERE (i_manufact = i1.i_manufact AND ((i_category = 'Women' AND (i_color = 'gainsboro' OR i_color = 'aquamarine') AND (i_units = 'Ounce' OR i_units = 'Dozen') AND (i_size = 'medium' OR i_size = 'economy')) OR (i_category = 'Women' AND (i_color = 'chiffon' OR i_color = 'violet') AND (i_units = 'Ton' OR i_units = 'Pound') AND (i_size = 'extra large' OR i_size = 'small')) OR (i_category = 'Men' AND (i_color = 'chartreuse' OR i_color = 'blue') AND (i_units = 'Each' OR i_units = 'Oz') AND (i_size = 'N/A' OR i_size = 'large')) OR (i_category = 'Men' AND (i_color = 'tan' OR i_color = 'dodger') AND (i_units = 'Bunch' OR i_units = 'Tsp') AND (i_size = 'medium' OR i_size = 'economy')))) OR (i_manufact = i1.i_manufact AND ((i_category = 'Women' AND (i_color = 'blanched' OR i_color = 'tomato') AND (i_units = 'Tbl' OR i_units = 'Case') AND (i_size = 'medium' OR i_size = 'economy')) OR (i_category = 'Women' AND (i_color = 'almond' OR i_color = 'lime') AND (i_units = 'Box' OR i_units = 'Dram') AND (i_size = 'extra large' OR i_size = 'small')) OR (i_category = 'Men' AND (i_color = 'peru' OR i_color = 'saddle') AND (i_units = 'Pallet' OR i_units = 'Gram') AND (i_size = 'N/A' OR i_size = 'large')) OR (i_category = 'Men' AND (i_color = 'indian' OR i_color = 'spring') AND (i_units = 'Unknown' OR i_units = 'Carton') AND (i_size = 'medium' OR i_size = 'economy'))))) > COUNT(*) AS item_cnt (per i_manufact))
    ├── SORT (i_product_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT ((i_product_name))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
