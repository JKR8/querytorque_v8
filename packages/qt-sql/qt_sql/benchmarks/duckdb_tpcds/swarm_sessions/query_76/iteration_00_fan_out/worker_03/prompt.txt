You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count and sum sales for rows with specific NULL foreign-key anomalies across store/web/catalog channels, grouped by channel, affected column name, year, quarter, and item category. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching rows in date_dim and item for each sale. Aggregation uses COUNT(*) and SUM(ext_sales_price) which are duplicate-insensitive. The NULL filters (ss_hdemo_sk IS NULL etc.) must remain on the fact tables before joining to preserve correct rows.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Similar to

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. multi_dimension_prefetch (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead with no selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause that reduces rows.
2. pushdown (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting a UNION CTE, eliminate the original UNION entirely.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category, sales_cnt, sales_amt in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_year, d_qoy, i_category for GROUP BY and join keys for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve NULL filter literals ('ss_hdemo_sk', 'ws_bill_addr_sk', 'cs_warehouse_sk') and channel names.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same rows and ordering.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Dimension tables scanned 3 times each (date_dim 3x, item 3x) per EXPLAIN.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs currently; opportunity to create shared dimension CTEs.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Extract shared dimension filters (date_cte, item_cte) and reference from each channel subquery; ignore promotion filter (not present).
- date_cte_isolate: Isolate date dimension with union of ranges; ignore decomposition warning (we are not decomposing existing CTE).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

### 2. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c

 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `col_name`
  3. `d_year`
  4. `d_qoy`
  5. `i_category`
  6. `sales_cnt`
  7. `sales_amt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Union three channel-specific NULL-condition extracts (ss_hdemo_sk, ws_bill_addr_sk, cs_warehouse_sk), then aggregate anomaly counts and sales amounts by channel/time/category dimensions.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item, date_dim, store_sales, web_sales)
    ├── JOIN (cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── FILTER (cs_warehouse_sk IS NULL)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (channel ASC, col_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, i_category ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category, sales_cnt, sales_amt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
