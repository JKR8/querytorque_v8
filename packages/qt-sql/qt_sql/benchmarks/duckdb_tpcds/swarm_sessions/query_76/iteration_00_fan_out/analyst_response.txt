CLASSIFY:
This is a multi-channel UNION ALL query with identical dimension joins (date_dim, item) but different fact tables and NULL filters on different columns. Each branch scans a large fact table with a NULL filter, joins to date_dim and item, then unions and aggregates. The EXPLAIN shows three independent fact scans (store_sales, web_sales, catalog_sales) each with their own dimension joins. The optimizer does NOT share dimension scans across branches.

EXPLAIN PLAN ANALYSIS:
Total runtime 749ms. Largest exclusive costs:
1. catalog_sales SEQ_SCAN: 288.2ms (38%), 36K rows from 172.8M (highly selective NULL filter)
2. store_sales SEQ_SCAN: 258.6ms (35%), 649K rows from 345.6M (moderately selective)
3. web_sales SEQ_SCAN: 50.9ms (7%), 843 rows from 86.4M (very selective)
4. HASH_GROUP_BY: 61.5ms (8%)
Each dimension table is scanned 3 times:
- date_dim: 3x scans at ~0.3ms each, ~1,800 rows each (fast but redundant)
- item: 3x scans at 0.7ms each, 102K rows each (larger redundant scan)

Row count drops: Fact scans filter by NULL column → reduces rows significantly before joins. After joins, rows stay similar (no extra filtering). Final aggregation reduces from ~686K rows to 660 groups.

The optimizer already pushes NULL filters into SEQ_SCAN (INTRA_SCAN_PREDICATE_PUSHDOWN works). It does NOT share dimension scans across UNION branches.

GAP MATCHING:
1. REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Each dimension table scanned 3 times. Opportunity: consolidate to 1 scan per dimension.
2. CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs currently, but we can create CTEs to share dimension scans.
3. UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: The UNION ALL is generic (same structure per channel). Could split into specialized CTEs, but not beneficial here since each branch already has different fact tables.
4. Engine strengths: DuckDB already pushes filters into scans, uses hash joins efficiently. We should focus on reducing redundant dimension scans and potentially consolidating fact scans.

AGGREGATION TRAP CHECK:
Only COUNT(*) and SUM(ext_sales_price). Both are duplicate-insensitive. Safe to push aggregation down or restructure.

TRANSFORM SELECTION:
Ranked by potential value:
1. star_join_prefetch (dimension_cte_isolate + prefetch_fact_join): Pre-filter date_dim and item into CTEs, then join each fact table to the shared CTEs. Reduces 3x dimension scans to 1x each.
2. single_pass_aggregation (channel_bitmap_aggregation): Consolidate three fact scans into one UNION ALL CTE that labels rows, then join once to dimensions. Reduces 3x dimension joins to 1x.
3. union_consolidation (shared_dimension_multi_channel): Extract shared dimension filters into common CTEs for all channels.
4. pushdown variant: Push aggregation down to each branch before union (aggregate_pushdown). Reduces rows flowing into union and final aggregation.

These are structurally diverse: (1) dimension isolation, (2) fact scan consolidation, (3) dimension sharing, (4) aggregation pushdown.

LOGICAL TREE DESIGN:
Need exhaustive column lists for CTEs. Key columns needed downstream:
- date_dim: d_date_sk (join), d_year, d_qoy (GROUP BY)
- item: i_item_sk (join), i_category (GROUP BY)
- Each fact table: join keys + ext_sales_price + NULL filter column
- Final output: channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category, sales_cnt, sales_amt

CTE materialization: Shared dimension CTEs referenced 3 times will likely be materialized (good). Fact consolidation CTE referenced once may be inlined.

=== SHARED BRIEFING ===

SEMANTIC_CONTRACT:
Count and sum sales for rows with specific NULL foreign-key anomalies across store/web/catalog channels, grouped by channel, affected column name, year, quarter, and item category. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching rows in date_dim and item for each sale. Aggregation uses COUNT(*) and SUM(ext_sales_price) which are duplicate-insensitive. The NULL filters (ss_hdemo_sk IS NULL etc.) must remain on the fact tables before joining to preserve correct rows.

BOTTLENECK_DIAGNOSIS:
Scan-bound: 3 sequential fact table scans consume 80% of runtime (catalog_sales 288ms, store_sales 259ms, web_sales 51ms). Each fact scan filters by a NULL column (selective) but still reads millions of rows. Dimension tables (date_dim, item) are scanned 3 times each redundantly. Cardinality flows: fact scans filter → ~686K rows → join with dimensions (no extra filter) → union → aggregate to 660 groups → limit 100. Optimizer already pushes NULL filters into scans and uses efficient hash joins. Logical-tree costs misleading: store_sales scan shows 35% but catalog_sales is actually higher (38%).

ACTIVE_CONSTRAINTS:
- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category, sales_cnt, sales_amt in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include d_year, d_qoy, i_category for GROUP BY and join keys for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve NULL filter literals ('ss_hdemo_sk', 'ws_bill_addr_sk', 'cs_warehouse_sk') and channel names.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return exactly same rows and ordering.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Dimension tables scanned 3 times each (date_dim 3x, item 3x) per EXPLAIN.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: No CTEs currently; opportunity to create shared dimension CTEs.

REGRESSION_WARNINGS:
1. multi_dimension_prefetch (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead with no selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause that reduces rows.
2. pushdown (0.68x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting a UNION CTE, eliminate the original UNION entirely.

EXAMPLE_ADAPTATION:
- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply pre-filtering of date_dim and item into CTEs; ignore cross-join warning (we are joining fact tables separately, not cross-joining dimension CTEs).
- prefetch_fact_join: Apply staged join pipeline: filter dimensions first, then pre-join each fact table; ignore the 2-chain limit (we have 3 fact tables, but each joins independently).
- date_cte_isolate: Extract date filter into CTE with union of ranges; ignore baseline time warning (749ms > 100ms threshold).
HAZARD_FLAGS:
- date_cte range must cover ALL branches (store/web: 2450816-2452642, catalog: 2450815-2452653) → use 2450815-2452653.
- item_cte has no WHERE clause; ensure materialization overhead doesn't outweigh scan savings (item scan is 0.7ms x3 = 2.1ms total, CTE materialization may be similar).

HAZARD_FLAGS:
- May lose predicate pushdown to date_dim because date range filters are not explicit in joined_sales. However, the join condition sold_date_sk = d_date_sk may still allow DuckDB to infer range from fact table's sold_date_sk values? Uncertain.
- all_sales_cte may be inlined (single reference), losing materialization benefit.

- Must ensure date ranges are per branch (store/web: 2450816-2452642, catalog: 2450815-2452653).
- Final merge must re-aggregate because same (channel, col_name, d_year, d_qoy, i_category) could appear across branches? Actually channel discriminates, so no overlap. Thus final merge could be just UNION ALL without re-aggregation? But we keep to be safe.
