You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Identify 1999 monthly store-sales outliers where monthly sales deviate >10% from the average monthly sales for that (category, brand, store, company) across months. JOIN semantics: INNER joins require matching keys in all four tables; missing matches eliminate rows. Aggregation trap: AVG(SUM(...)) OVER partition must compute average of monthly sums per partition; changing grouping changes denominator. Filter dependency: The CASE filter depends on avg_monthly_sales; NULL when avg_monthly_sales = 0 must be preserved.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure the partition average is mathematically equivalent to AVG OVER (PARTITION BY ...)
- Join between aggregated_with_avg and partition_avg must be on correct columns

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR duplicated fact table scans
   RULE: Do not split OR on same column family (i_category/i_class) unless categories are disjoint and branches have independent selectivity
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added materialization overhead
   RULE: Every dimension CTE must have a WHERE clause that reduces rows
3. date_cte_isolate (0.5x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated
   RULE: This query baseline 592ms, CTE overhead acceptable

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all original columns (i_category, i_class, i_brand, s_store_name, s_company_name, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales)
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, grouping columns, aggregates)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_year=1999, category/class strings exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales, s_store_name LIMIT 100)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Item filter applied after join; pre-filtering item into CTE could push predicate earlier
- SCAN_CONSOLIDATION_PIVOT: Only one scan per table; no consolidation opportunity

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Compute multiple aggregates in one pass; adapt by computing sum_sales and partition average in separate aggregations then join; ignore the CASE WHEN labeling (not needed)
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Consolidate computations; ignore the bucket labeling

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate monthly sales by product/store dimensions, compute average monthly sales with a window function, filter rows with >10% relative deviation, and order by deviation and store.
    ├── SCAN (item, store_sales, date_dim, store)
    ├── FILTER (CASE WHEN (avg_monthly_sales <> 0) THEN (ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales) ELSE NULL END > 0.1)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales ASC, s_store_name ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
