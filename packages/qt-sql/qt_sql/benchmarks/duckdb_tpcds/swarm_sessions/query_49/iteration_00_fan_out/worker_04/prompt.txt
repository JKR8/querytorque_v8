You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Across web, catalog, and store channels for Dec-1999, rank items by return-quantity ratio and return-currency ratio, returning top-10 by either ranking per channel. LEFT JOIN with returns tables preserves items with no returns (COALESCE to 0), but wr_return_amt>10000 filter NULL-rejects returns rows, effectively making it an inner join for matching rows while keeping items without returns (which get 0 in aggregates). Aggregates use COALESCE to 0, making them duplicate-insensitive. Window rankings are computed per-channel after aggregation. The final filter (return_rank≤10 OR currency_rank≤10) must be applied per channel before UNION.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex UNION ALL may inhibit join pushdown; ensure date join happens after UNION.
- Different join keys (order_number vs ticket_number) require NULL handling.
- Must preserve COALESCE semantics for NULL returns.
- Window functions must partition by channel to rank per-channel.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2719ms >> 100ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Do NOT split return_rank≤10 OR currency_rank≤10 into UNION - same derived columns.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join fact to each dimension independently.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (item_sk, date_sk, return columns, etc.).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=1999, d_moy=12, amount thresholds >10000, net_profit>1, net_paid>0, quantity>0.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY 1,4,5,2).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 3 times independently (EXPLAIN shows 3 SEQ_SCAN date_dim nodes).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times for same filter (d_year=1999, d_moy=12).
- SHARED_DIMENSION_MULTI_CHANNEL: All 3 channel branches share identical date_dim filter.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple scans into one UNION ALL with channel discriminator. Ignore the CASE WHEN aggregation (we use UNION ALL of pre-joined data).
- single_pass_aggregation: Apply principle of single scan over combined data. Ignore the scalar subquery consolidation.
- union_cte_split: Reverse pattern - instead of splitting, we consolidate UNION branches. Ignore the splitting aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `item`
  3. `return_ratio`
  4. `return_rank`
  5. `currency_rank`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — For each channel, left-join sales to returns, compute item-level quantity and value return ratios under profitability/volume constraints, rank items by both ratios, keep top-10 by either metric, and union channel outputs.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales AS sts (join), store_returns AS sr (join), date_dim, web_sales AS ws (join), web_returns AS wr (join), catalog_sales AS cs (join), catalog_returns AS cr (join))
    ├── FILTER ((store.return_rank <= 10 OR store.currency_rank <= 10))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (1 ASC, 4 ASC, 5 ASC, 2 ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
