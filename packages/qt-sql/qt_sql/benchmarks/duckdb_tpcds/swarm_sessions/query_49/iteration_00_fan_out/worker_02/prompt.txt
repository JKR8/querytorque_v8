You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Across web, catalog, and store channels for Dec-1999, rank items by return-quantity ratio and return-currency ratio, returning top-10 by either ranking per channel. LEFT JOIN with returns tables preserves items with no returns (COALESCE to 0), but wr_return_amt>10000 filter NULL-rejects returns rows, effectively making it an inner join for matching rows while keeping items without returns (which get 0 in aggregates). Aggregates use COALESCE to 0, making them duplicate-insensitive. Window rankings are computed per-channel after aggregation. The final filter (return_rank≤10 OR currency_rank≤10) must be applied per channel before UNION.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Moving wr_return_amt>10000 into JOIN ON clause must preserve semantics: items without returns still included with return_qty=0.
- Ensure COALESCE in web_joined_returns OUTPUT handles NULL returns correctly.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2719ms >> 100ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Do NOT split return_rank≤10 OR currency_rank≤10 into UNION - same derived columns.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; join fact to each dimension independently.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (item_sk, date_sk, return columns, etc.).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=1999, d_moy=12, amount thresholds >10000, net_profit>1, net_paid>0, quantity>0.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering (ORDER BY 1,4,5,2).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 3 times independently (EXPLAIN shows 3 SEQ_SCAN date_dim nodes).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times for same filter (d_year=1999, d_moy=12).
- SHARED_DIMENSION_MULTI_CHANNEL: All 3 channel branches share identical date_dim filter.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply exactly - extract shared date filter into CTE used by all channels. Ignore the item/promotion filters (not present).
- prefetch_fact_join: Apply staged join pipeline: filtered_dates CTE -> join with sales -> then join with returns. Ignore subsequent dimension joins (none).
- multi_dimension_prefetch: Apply principle of pre-filtering dimension (date) into CTE before fact join. Ignore multiple dimensions (only date).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

**Principle:** Shared Dimension Extraction: when multiple channel CTEs (store/catalog/web) apply identical dimension filters, extract those shared filters into one CTE and reference it from each channel. Avoids redundant dimension scans.

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)

		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales

```

```

### 3. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,

        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `item`
  3. `return_ratio`
  4. `return_rank`
  5. `currency_rank`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — For each channel, left-join sales to returns, compute item-level quantity and value return ratios under profitability/volume constraints, rank items by both ratios, keep top-10 by either metric, and union channel outputs.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales AS sts (join), store_returns AS sr (join), date_dim, web_sales AS ws (join), web_returns AS wr (join), catalog_sales AS cs (join), catalog_returns AS cr (join))
    ├── FILTER ((store.return_rank <= 10 OR store.currency_rank <= 10))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (1 ASC, 4 ASC, 5 ASC, 2 ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (channel, item, return_ratio, return_rank, currency_rank)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
