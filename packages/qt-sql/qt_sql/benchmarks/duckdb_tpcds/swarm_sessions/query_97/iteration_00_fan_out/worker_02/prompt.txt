You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare customer-item coverage between store and catalog channels over month sequence 1214-1225 by counting store-only, catalog-only, and overlapping customer-item pairs. The FULL OUTER JOIN preserves all rows from both sides, with NULLs indicating absence in one channel; the three conditional sums count membership in each bucket. Aggregation uses SUM of 0/1 flags (duplicate-safe). The date filter (d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214+11) must be applied identically to both store_sales and catalog_sales before grouping.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Three separate EXISTS subqueries may rescan catalog_distinct/store_distinct multiple times; ensure they are CTEs to avoid recomputation.
- Must preserve COUNT(*) semantics (counts distinct pairs, which matches original because inputs are already distinct).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2311ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only two independent fact tables joined via FULL OUTER JOIN, no multi-way fact joins, so safe.
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Not applicable; no OR conditions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly three columns: store_only, catalog_only, store_and_catalog.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must output customer_sk and item_sk for downstream join/aggregation.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq values 1214 and 1214+11.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must match original row counts for each bucket.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned twice (once per CTE) with same filter; opportunity to share.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active; each fact table scanned once.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Not active.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- intersect_to_exists: Apply the pattern of replacing set operations with EXISTS semi-joins. Ignore INTERSECT specific; we emulate FULL OUTER JOIN counts via EXISTS/ NOT EXISTS.
- multi_intersect_exists_cte: Use separate EXISTS checks for each bucket, pre-materializing distinct sets. Ignore cascading INTERSECT.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `store_only`
  2. `catalog_only`
  3. `store_and_catalog`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
