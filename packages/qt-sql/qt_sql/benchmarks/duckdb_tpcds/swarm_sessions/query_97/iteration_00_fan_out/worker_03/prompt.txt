You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare customer-item coverage between store and catalog channels over month sequence 1214-1225 by counting store-only, catalog-only, and overlapping customer-item pairs. The FULL OUTER JOIN preserves all rows from both sides, with NULLs indicating absence in one channel; the three conditional sums count membership in each bucket. Aggregation uses SUM of 0/1 flags (duplicate-safe). The date filter (d_month_seq between 1214 and 1214+11) must be applied identically to both store_sales and catalog_sales before grouping.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

    CONSUMERS: none

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Scalar subqueries may force materialization of store_agg and catalog_agg CTEs; could be expensive.
- DuckDB may optimize correlated EXISTS into semi-joins; ensure CTEs are defined before main SELECT.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 2311ms, so CTE overhead acceptable.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only two independent fact tables joined via FULL OUTER JOIN, no multi-way fact joins, so safe.
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Not applicable; no OR conditions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly three columns: store_only, catalog_only, store_and_catalog.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must output customer_sk and item_sk for downstream join/aggregation.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq values 1214 and 1214+11.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result must match original row counts for each bucket.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned twice (once per CTE) with same filter; opportunity to share.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active; each fact table scanned once.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Not active.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate multiple aggregations into single query using scalar subqueries that reference pre-aggregated CTEs. Ignore CASE aggregation within single scan; we have separate scans but reuse CTEs.
- pushdown: Push date filter into CTEs and compute distinct sets once, then reuse in scalar subqueries. Ignore consolidation of multiple subqueries; we have three scalar subqueries.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**

                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales

                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)

```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `store_only`
  2. `catalog_only`
  3. `store_and_catalog`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
