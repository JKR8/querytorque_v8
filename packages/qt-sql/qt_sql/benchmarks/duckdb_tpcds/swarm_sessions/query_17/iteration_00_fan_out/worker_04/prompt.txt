You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For items sold in stores during 2001Q1 that were later returned (2001Q1-Q3) and then re-purchased via catalog (2001Q1-Q3) by the same customer, compute per-item-per-state statistical distributions (count, avg, stddev, cov) of quantities across all three channels. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics) requiring matches across all 3 fact tables. Aggregates (STDDEV_SAMP/AVG) are grouping-sensitive to row duplication from joins. The date filters (d1='2001Q1', d2/d3 IN quarters) are independent per alias but share the same date_dim base table.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The self-LEFT JOIN pattern may explode cardinality if not carefully constrained.
- Must ensure the WHERE clause (3-way match) replicates original INNER join semantics.
- UNION ALL changes nullability of columns (store_sk, ticket_number).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This exploration tests consolidation of 3 fact table scans into a labeled UNION structure with post-join filtering, which differs from failed patterns that involved EXISTS materialization or same-column OR splitting.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered store_sales to date CTE before 3-way fact join, preventing optimizer from reordering multi-way fact joins.
   RULE: Avoid forcing early fact-table CTE chains when query has 3+ fact table joins (this query has 3).
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially to fact tables.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 14 aggregate columns + 3 grouping columns exactly as named.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each CTE must output all keys (date_sk, item_sk, store_sk, customer_sk, ticket_number) needed for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact quarter strings '2001Q1','2001Q2','2001Q3'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_state.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows 3 separate date_dim scans (91, 274, 274 rows) - could be pre-materialized.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times (cheap but redundant).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply consolidation of multiple channel scans into labeled UNION ALL. Ignore the CASE WHEN aggregation pivot.
- single_pass_aggregation: Apply single scan per fact table but consolidate through UNION. Ignore that we still scan 3 tables.
- union_cte_split: Apply splitting by channel via UNION ALL. Ignore the year-splitting aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

### 3. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `s_state`
  4. `store_sales_quantitycount`
  5. `store_sales_quantityave`
  6. `store_sales_quantitystdev`
  7. `store_sales_quantitycov`
  8. `store_returns_quantitycount`
  9. `store_returns_quantityave`
  10. `store_returns_quantitystdev`
  11. `store_returns_quantitycov`
  12. `catalog_sales_quantitycount`
  13. `catalog_sales_quantityave`
  14. `catalog_sales_quantitystdev`
  15. `catalog_sales_quantitycov`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Link store sales to matching returns and catalog sales through customer/item relationships and quarter filters, then aggregate multi-channel quantity distribution statistics per item and state.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), catalog_sales (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), date_dim AS d2 (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), store (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ss_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+8 more)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_quarter_name = '2001Q1')
    ├── FILTER (d2.d_quarter_name IN ('2001Q1', '2001Q2', '2001Q3'))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC, i_item_desc ASC, s_state ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_state, store_sales_quantitycount, store_sales_quantityave, store_sales_quantitystdev, store_sales_quantitycov, store_returns_quantitycount, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
