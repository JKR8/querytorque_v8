You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Rank December 1999 store-sales revenue by brand/manufacturer for manager_id=2 items purchased by customers whose current ZIP differs from the selling store ZIP prefix. All joins are INNER (intersection), so all tables must match. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-sensitive but safe because grouping is at item brand level. The ZIP mismatch filter depends on both customer_address and store tables; moving it earlier could break join semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Aggregating before ZIP mismatch filter may increase group count (customer/store included in GROUP BY). Verify SUM remains correct (it does because ext_price is at sale level, and grouping includes customer/store).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x regression):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x regression):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query's baseline is 388ms (>100ms), so transform is acceptable.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x regression):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: No EXISTS in this query, but avoid materializing filters that could stay as semi-joins.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_brand_id, i_brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact, ext_price in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, grouping columns, filters like ca_zip, s_zip).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep d_moy=12, d_year=1999, i_manager_id=2 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows ordered by ext_price DESC, i_brand, i_brand_id, i_manufact_id, i_manufact.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Optimizer pushes predicates into scans but not across CTE boundaries. Creating dimension CTEs can reduce fact probe size.
- LATE_ATTRIBUTE_BINDING_OPPORTUNITY: Customer and customer_address columns only used in ZIP mismatch filter and final output, not in WHERE/GROUP BY.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- deferred_window_aggregation: Apply delaying expensive operations (ZIP check) until after aggregation; ignore window function aspect.
- early_filter: Apply filtering date and item early; ignore that customer/store filtering is deferred.
- dimension_cte_isolate: Apply isolating date and item filters; ignore that customer/address are not isolated.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk

     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative

                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative

```

**AFTER (fast):**

```
[store_daily]:
```sql

```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 19 in stream 0 using template query19.tpl
select i_brand_id brand_id, i_brand brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact,
 	sum(ss_ext_sales_price) ext_price
 from date_dim, store_sales, item,customer,customer_address,store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
   and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
   and i_manager_id=2
   and d_moy=12
   and d_year=1999
   and ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk 
   and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
   and substr(ca_zip,1,5) <> substr(s_zip,1,5) 
   and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk 
 group by i_brand
      ,i_brand_id
      ,i_manufact_id
      ,i_manufact
 order by ext_price desc
         ,i_brand
         ,i_brand_id
         ,i_manufact_id
         ,i_manufact
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 19 in stream 0 using template query19.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `brand_id`
  2. `brand`
  3. `i_manufact_id`
  4. `i_manufact`
  5. `ext_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with date, item, customer, address, and store; filter by month/year, manager id, and ZIP-prefix mismatch; aggregate extended sales price by brand/manufacturer attributes; and order by descending revenue.
    ├── SCAN (date_dim, store_sales (join), item (join), customer (join), customer_address (join), store (join))
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_manager_id = 2)
    ├── FILTER (d_moy = 12)
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ext_price DESC, i_brand ASC, i_brand_id ASC, i_manufact_id ASC, i_manufact ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (brand_id, brand, i_manufact_id, i_manufact, ext_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {

    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
