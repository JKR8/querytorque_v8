You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Identify manufacturers with quarterly sales volatility in month sequence 1200-1211 for selected category/class/brand bundles by flagging quarter totals that deviate more than 10% from manufacturer average quarterly sales. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics). The window function AVG(SUM(...)) OVER must compute the average of per-manufacturer quarterly totals exactly as the original grouping (i_manufact_id, d_qoy). The final filter depends on the window result, so cannot be pushed below window.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The prefact_cte may still scan 5.4M rows (store filter may not reduce scan if not pushed). The item filter is applied after the join, so no reduction in fact scan.
- This strategy may not reduce the store_sales scan cost compared to original.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (observed regression: 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR doubled fact table scans without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Do not split OR into UNION ALL if it would cause multiple fact table scans.
2. date_cte_isolate (observed regression: 0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline already optimized (date predicate pushed), CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: Avoid creating date CTE if date filter already pushed down (it is in this plan).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_manufact_id, sum_sales, avg_quarterly_sales.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., i_manufact_id, d_qoy, ss_sales_price, join keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values for d_month_seq (1200..1211), item categories/classes/brands, and threshold 0.1.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, columns, ordering (avg_quarterly_sales ASC, sum_sales ASC, i_manufact_id ASC) with LIMIT 100.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Item and store filters are applied after join in current plan; pre-filtering into CTEs could reduce join probe size.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Fact table scanned once; no redundancy.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- prefetch_fact_join: Apply the concept of pre-joining fact with some dimensions (date, store) before joining others (item); ignore the multi-channel aspect.
- early_filter: Apply filtering of date and store early; ignore the reason table filter.
- pushdown: Apply consolidating joins into a CTE chain; ignore the multiple subquery consolidation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql

```

```sql

OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...)))

```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store sales by manufacturer and quarter under the item-attribute filters, compute manufacturer average quarterly sales via window function, and keep rows with relative deviation above 10%.
    ├── SCAN (item, store_sales, date_dim, store)
    ├── FILTER (CASE WHEN avg_quarterly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_quarterly_sales) / avg_quarterly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (avg_quarterly_sales ASC, sum_sales ASC, i_manufact_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
