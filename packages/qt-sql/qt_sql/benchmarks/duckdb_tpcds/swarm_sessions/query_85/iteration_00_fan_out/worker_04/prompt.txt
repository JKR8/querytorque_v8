You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

For web returns in year 2000 with matched refunded/returning customer demographics, compute reason-level averages of quantity, refunded cash, and fee under specific marital/education/price profiles and US state/profit ranges. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches from all eight tables. AVG aggregates are duplicate-sensitive but joins preserve original web_sales↔web_returns cardinality. Filter dependencies: ws_sales_price and ws_net_profit filters depend on web_sales table; cd1 and cd2 filters must match exactly; ca_state filters depend on customer_address table.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Each branch still rescans web_sales and web_returns (3 scans each).
- filtered_cd1/cd2 CTEs are shared but each branch filters further – may cause redundant materialization.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines dimension_cte_isolate + or_to_union)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact table scans with no selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Only split ORs that span DIFFERENT columns/tables. Here, OR branches involve different marital/education values AND different price ranges – valid for splitting.
2. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them sequentially with fact table. Ensure each CTE has WHERE clause.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output substr(r_reason_desc,1,20), avg(ws_quantity), avg(wr_refunded_cash), avg(wr_fee) in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream: join keys, filter columns, and output columns.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: 'M', '4 yr Degree', 100.00, 150.00, 'S', 'Secondary', 50.00, 100.00, 'W', 'Advanced Degree', 150.00, 200.00, 'United States', state lists, profit ranges, d_year=2000.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 13 rows with same averages and ordering.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR conditions span cd_marital_status, cd_education_status, ws_sales_price, ca_state, ws_net_profit – prevents optimal scan path.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: ws_sales_price and ws_net_profit filters appear as late FILTER nodes, not pushed into web_sales scan.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

composite_decorrelate_union: Apply shared dimension CTEs (date, address) across multiple UNION branches; ignore EXISTS decorrelation – no correlated subqueries.
  single_pass_aggregation: Apply consolidation of demographic filters into filtered_cd1/cd2 CTEs; ignore CASE aggregation – not needed.
  channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply branch-specific filtering in separate scans; ignore bitmap technique – use UNION ALL.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc, 1, 20`
  2. `AVG(ws_quantity)`
  3. `AVG(wr_refunded_cash)`
  4. `AVG(wr_fee)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales, web returns, web page, two demographic roles, address, date, and reason; enforce OR-based marital/education/price clauses plus OR-based state/profit clauses; then aggregate reason-level averages.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, web_returns (join), web_page (join), customer_demographics AS cd1 (join), customer_demographics AS cd2 (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join), reason (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws_web_page_sk = wp_web_page_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_item_sk = wr_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+6 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2000)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc, 1, 20) ASC, AVG(ws_quantity) ASC, AVG(wr_refunded_cash) ASC, AVG(wr_fee) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (SUBSTRING(r_reason_desc, 1, 20, AVG(ws_quantity), AVG(wr_refunded_cash), AVG(wr_fee))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
