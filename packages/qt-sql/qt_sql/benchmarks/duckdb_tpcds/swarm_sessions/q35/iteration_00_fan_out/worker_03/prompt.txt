## Optimization Strategy: aggressive_multi_channel_prefetch

**Your approach**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then decorrelate EXISTS conditions into pre-aggregated customer sets per channel.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

### DuckDB Engine Characteristics

- **Columnar storage**: SELECT only the columns you need. Removing unused columns from intermediate CTEs reduces memory and speeds scans.
- **CTE inlining**: DuckDB inlines CTEs by default (no materialization fence). A CTE referenced once is zero-cost. A CTE referenced multiple times may be re-executed — consider whether re-execution or explicit materialization is cheaper.
- **FILTER clause**: Use `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)` instead of `SUM(CASE WHEN cond THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`. FILTER is native syntax, skips branch evaluation, and enables better vectorized execution.
- **Predicate pushdown limits**: The optimizer pushes simple predicates into base table scans but CANNOT push filters through multi-level CTEs, window functions, or UNION ALL. You must move filters inside manually.
- **Hash joins**: DuckDB uses hash joins for most equi-joins. Build the smaller side first — put the filtered dimension CTE on the build side.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Join customer/address/demographics, enforce multi-channel purchase existence constraints for 2001 quarters 1-3, then group by geography and demographic dependent-count attributes to compute counts/sums/max statistics.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), cd_dep_employed_count, cnt2, ...] — ordered by ca_state ASC, cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_dep_count ASC, cd_dep_employed_count ASC, cd_dep_college_count ASC
**Dependencies**: customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join)
**Joins**: c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk | cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk
**Filters**: EXISTS(SELECT * FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4)
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[customer_demographics]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  ca_state,
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_dep_count,
  COUNT(*) AS cnt1,
  MAX(cd_dep_count),
  SUM(cd_dep_count),

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```

```

### 2. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: pushdown on q31 (0.49xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When creating filtered versions of existing CTEs, always REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs. Keeping both causes redundant materialization and 1000x+ cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
**Why it regressed:** Created both filtered (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) AND original (ss, ws) versions of the same aggregations. The query does a 6-way self-join matching quarterly patterns (Q1->Q2->Q3). Duplicate CTEs doubled materialization and confused the optimizer's cardinality estimates for the multi-self-join.

### Warning 2: pushdown on q74 (0.68xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When splitting a UNION CTE by year, you MUST remove or replace the original UNION CTE. Keeping both the split and original versions causes redundant materialization and extreme cardinality misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Created year-specific CTEs (store_sales_1999, store_sales_2000, etc.) but KEPT the original year_total union CTE alongside them. The optimizer materializes both the split versions and the original union, resulting in redundant computation. Projection cardinality estimates show 10^16x errors from the confused CTE graph.

### Warning 3: semantic_rewrite on q16 (0.14xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Never materialize GROUP BY aggregates with HAVING clauses on fact tables before filtering those fact tables through dimension joins.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized a GROUP BY self-join (HAVING MIN() <> MAX()) on the entire fact table BEFORE applying date/address/call_center filters. The original query filters catalog_sales first via correlated EXISTS clauses, then checks warehouse conditions. Pre-materializing the unfiltered self-join creates a massive intermediate result the optimizer cannot cost-estimate correctly.


## Filter Pushdown Heuristic

SQL optimizers CANNOT push filters through multi-level CTEs, window functions, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or UNION ALL boundaries. You must move them manually. Apply these rules:

1. **Static filter on CTE output → move inside CTE**
   If the final SELECT (or an outer CTE) filters on a column produced by an inner CTE with a literal/constant value, move that WHERE clause inside the CTE definition. This reduces the intermediate result set.

2. **Date/dimension filter → push to earliest scan**
   If a date or dimension filter appears in the final query, push it into the CTE that first joins with the dimension table. Pre-filtering the dimension table into a small CTE and joining early is even better.

3. **Repeated filter across CTEs → extract shared CTE**
   If the same filter predicate (e.g., `d_year = 2001`) appears in multiple subqueries or CTEs, extract the filtered result into one shared CTE and reference it everywhere.

4. **Filter after GROUP BY → push before GROUP BY**
   If a HAVING clause or post-aggregation filter can be expressed as a pre-aggregation WHERE, move it before GROUP BY to reduce rows entering the aggregation.

5. **Filter after window function → cannot push through**
   Window functions require the full partition to compute. Do NOT push filters before window functions unless the filter is on partition columns only (which narrows partitions without changing results).

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**
Never apply or_to_union when the query contains a self-join (the same table appears twice with different aliases). Splitting self-join queries into UNION branches forces each branch to independently perform the self-join, doubling or tripling execution time. Observed 0.51x regression on Q23.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_MATERIALIZED_KEYWORD_PG**
Do NOT use the AS MATERIALIZED keyword on CTEs. Write plain CTEs: 'name AS (SELECT ...)'. PostgreSQL automatically materializes CTEs when beneficial. Forcing materialization on small dimension CTEs (< 1000 rows) adds temp-table I/O overhead that causes regressions (0.69x observed). The proven gold examples use plain CTEs without MATERIALIZED.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**PREFETCH_MULTI_FACT_CHAIN**
When using prefetch_fact_join, do not create more than 2 cascading CTEs that each reference a fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales, etc.). Each CTE in the chain materializes a large intermediate result. Observed 0.78x regression on Q4 from 3 cascading fact CTEs.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**SINGLE_PASS_AGGREGATION_LIMIT**
When applying single_pass_aggregation (consolidating repeated scans into CASE WHEN aggregates), use at most 8 CASE branches. Beyond 8 branches, the per-row CASE evaluation overhead can negate the benefit of reducing table scans. If the original query has more than 8 distinct filter conditions, keep some scans separate rather than forcing all into one pass.

**UNION_CTE_SPLIT_MUST_REPLACE**
When applying union_cte_split (splitting UNION into CTEs), the original UNION must be eliminated from the main query. The main query should reference the split CTEs, not duplicate the UNION branches. If the rewritten query has more UNION ALL operations than the original, the rewrite is incorrect.

**DECORRELATE_MUST_FILTER_FIRST**
When decorrelating a correlated subquery into a JOIN, ensure all original WHERE filters are preserved in the replacement CTE or JOIN condition. A decorrelation without selective filters creates a cross-product that is larger than the original per-row correlated execution. The replacement CTE must filter to at most the same cardinality as the original subquery.

**DIMENSION_CTE_SAME_COLUMN_OR**
Do not create dimension CTEs to isolate OR conditions that filter the same column. The optimizer handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan. Only apply dimension_cte_isolate when filters span different columns or different dimension tables.

**EARLY_FILTER_CTE_BEFORE_CHAIN**
When creating an early_filter CTE, ensure it is actually referenced in the main query chain. The original unfiltered table reference must be replaced with the CTE reference. Do not create CTEs that filter a table if the main query still joins the original unfiltered table — this adds overhead without benefit.

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_CROSS_JOIN_DIMENSIONS**
NEVER combine multiple dimension tables into a single CTE via CROSS JOIN, Cartesian product, or JOIN ON TRUE. Even small dimensions (30 dates × 200 items × 20 promos = 120K rows) create huge intermediate results that prevent index use on fact tables. Always keep each dimension as a SEPARATE CTE: filtered_date AS (...), filtered_item AS (...), filtered_promotion AS (...). This was validated at 3.32x with separate CTEs vs 0.0076x with a merged CROSS JOIN CTE.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**OR_TO_UNION_SELF_JOIN**

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_state`
  2. `cd_gender`
  3. `cd_marital_status`
  4. `cd_dep_count`
  5. `cnt1`
  6. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  7. `SUM(cd_dep_count)`
  8. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  9. `cd_dep_employed_count`
  10. `cnt2`
  11. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  12. `SUM(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  13. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  14. `cd_dep_college_count`
  15. `cnt3`
  16. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`
  17. `SUM(cd_dep_college_count)`
  18. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.
