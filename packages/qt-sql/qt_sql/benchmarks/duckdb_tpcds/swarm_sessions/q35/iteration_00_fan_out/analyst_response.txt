WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply safe filter pushdown and early dimension table filtering to reduce join sizes before tackling correlated subqueries.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, materialize_cte
HINT: Isolate shared date dimension filtering into CTEs and pre-filter multiple dimension tables separately to optimize join order.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_channel_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, composite_decorrelate_union, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then decorrelate EXISTS conditions into pre-aggregated customer sets per channel.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, channel_bitmap_aggregation, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Transform OR-connected EXISTS into UNION ALL branches, then consolidate multiple channel scans into a single-pass aggregation or bitmap-based customer identification.
