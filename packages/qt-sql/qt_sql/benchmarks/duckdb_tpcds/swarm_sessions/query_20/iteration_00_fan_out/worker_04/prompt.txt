You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute catalog sales revenue per item for Shoes/Books/Women categories within a 30-day window starting 2002-01-26, then calculate each item's percentage contribution within its item class. INNER JOIN semantics require all dimension matches. SUM aggregates are duplicate-safe. The revenueratio depends on class-level totals; moving filters must preserve class membership. The i_category filter on item must be applied before computing class totals.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function computed during aggregation may not be faster than separate step.
- Risk of materialization overhead from multiple CTEs.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate on q25 (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and materialized fact table before 3-way fact join, losing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Avoid materializing fact table CTEs when query has multiple fact joins (not applicable here).
2. date_cte_isolate on q67 (0.85x):
   CAUSE: Materialized dimension CTEs before ROLLUP/window, preventing pushdown.
   RULE: Avoid dimension CTEs before window functions if baseline <100ms.
3. prefetch_fact_join on q25 (0.50x):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Skip CTE transforms if baseline <100ms unless proven win.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output all 7 columns with original aliases and ordering.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (item attributes, cs_ext_sales_price, join keys).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact date '2002-01-26', interval 30 DAY, and category list.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must produce identical 100 rows with same ordering.
- ENGINE_GAP: CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS (potential) - predicates on item and date_dim could be pushed earlier via CTEs.
- ENGINE_GAP: REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION (not active) - single scans already.
- ENGINE_GAP: WINDOW_OPTIMIZATION (active) - window function over 14K rows is costly.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply: Combine prefetch (dimension CTEs) with window computation inside same aggregation step.
  Ignore: The deferred_window_aggregation defers window; we compute window during aggregation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_category`
  4. `i_class`
  5. `i_current_price`
  6. `itemrevenue`
  7. `revenueratio`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales to item and date, filter to the date window and target categories, aggregate revenue per item attributes, and compute class-level revenue share using a window partition on i_class.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_category IN ('Shoes', 'Books', 'Women'))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) AND (CAST('2002-01-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_item_id ASC, i_item_desc ASC, revenueratio ASC)

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
