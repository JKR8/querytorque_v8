You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find South Dakota customers whose total 2000 store-return fees at a given store exceed 120% of that store's average customer return total. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches on both sides. Aggregates are SUM and AVG without FILTER clauses, safe to restructure. The store filter (s_state='SD') depends only on store table and can be pushed before fact table joins.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function computed per store may add overhead for large groups.
- Must ensure window function AVG(SUM(...)) OVER is correct semantically (same as separate GROUP BY).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combines star_join_prefetch with window function for single-pass store average computation)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q1_decorrelate (0.71x):
   CAUSE: Pre-aggregating GROUP BY into CTEs when query uses correlated comparison loses incremental filter pushdown.
   RULE: Do NOT create separate store_averages CTE unless we also push store filter into the CTE to reduce aggregation input.
2. regression_q25_date_cte_isolate (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering fact table before multi-way joins prevents optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (store_returns), so pre-filtering safe.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly c_customer_id ordered ascending.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (store_sk, customer_sk, total_return).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, s_state='SD', multiplier 1.2.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 customer IDs in same order.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Store filter applied after CTE materialization (EXPLAIN shows store filter in separate HASH_JOIN after CTE_SCAN).
- GLOBAL GUARD RAIL #5: Baseline 0.113s (<100ms) suggests CTE overhead could dominate; but store filter reduces CTE rows 70%, worth testing.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate aggregation and store average computation into single GROUP BY with window function; ignore the multiple subquery consolidation (this query has one).
- deferred_window_aggregation: Compute window function (store average) after filtering; but here window is computed in same step as aggregation (cannot defer).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

                  from store_sales

```

### 2. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
