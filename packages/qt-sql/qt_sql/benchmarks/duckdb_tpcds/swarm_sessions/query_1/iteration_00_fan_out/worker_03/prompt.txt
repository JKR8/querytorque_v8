You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find South Dakota customers whose total 2000 store-return fees at a given store exceed 120% of that store's average customer return total. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches on both sides. Aggregates are SUM and AVG without FILTER clauses, safe to restructure. The store filter (s_state='SD') depends only on store table and can be pushed before fact table joins.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Combining store filter into CTE reduces rows but may prevent optimizer from reordering joins (only one fact table, safe).
- Must ensure date_dim join remains in CTE (required for d_year filter).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q1_decorrelate (0.71x):
   CAUSE: Pre-aggregating GROUP BY into CTEs when query uses correlated comparison loses incremental filter pushdown.
   RULE: Do NOT create separate store_averages CTE unless we also push store filter into the CTE to reduce aggregation input.
2. regression_q25_date_cte_isolate (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering fact table before multi-way joins prevents optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (store_returns), so pre-filtering safe.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly c_customer_id ordered ascending.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (store_sk, customer_sk, total_return).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, s_state='SD', multiplier 1.2.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 customer IDs in same order.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Store filter applied after CTE materialization (EXPLAIN shows store filter in separate HASH_JOIN after CTE_SCAN).
- GLOBAL GUARD RAIL #5: Baseline 0.113s (<100ms) suggests CTE overhead could dominate; but store filter reduces CTE rows 70%, worth testing.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- dimension_cte_isolate: Pre-filter store and date dimensions, but combine them into single CTE with fact join; ignore warning about cross-joining dimension CTEs.
- early_filter: Filter dimension tables (store, date_dim) first, then join to fact table; apply to both dimensions simultaneously.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 1 in stream 0 using template query1.tpl
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 1 in stream 0 using template query1.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
