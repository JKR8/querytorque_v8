You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute the ratio of AM to PM web order counts for households with two dependents viewing medium-length pages, comparing 10:00-11:59 versus 16:00-17:59 time windows. All joins are INNER (intersection semantics), requiring matching rows in all four tables. The only aggregates are COUNT(*), which are duplicate-insensitive. The time windows are disjoint (a sale cannot be in both), allowing safe consolidation with conditional aggregation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Ensure time windows are disjoint; use OR in filtered_time CTE, not UNION ALL.
- The PM scan was much slower; single scan may exhibit mixed performance.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (0.59x regression on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range (t_hour BETWEEN ... OR ...) into UNION ALL, doubling fact table scans.
   RULE: Never split same-column ORs on time ranges into UNION ALL for this query.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly am_pm_ratio column.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., time keys for joins).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: t_hour 10/11/16/17, hd_dep_count=2, wp_char_count 5000-5200.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical ratio value.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Two web_sales scans present (evidence: EXPLAIN shows SEQ_SCAN web_sales twice, 44.2ms + 290.3ms).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply the pattern of replacing multiple scalar subqueries with a single CTE using conditional aggregates. Ignore the complex multi-table join structure; focus on the CASE/ FILTER inside COUNT.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Apply the consolidation of multiple fact scans into one with CASE labels. Ignore the bitmap aggregation aspect; use simple conditional COUNT.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `am_pm_ratio`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Calculate qualifying web-sales counts for the AM and PM windows in two aggregate subqueries and divide AM count by PM count to produce am_pm_ratio.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, web_page)
    ├── JOIN (ws_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_ship_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk)

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
