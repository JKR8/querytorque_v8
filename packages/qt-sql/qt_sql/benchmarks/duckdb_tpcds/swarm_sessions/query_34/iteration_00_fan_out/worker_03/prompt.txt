You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customer tickets with 15-20 line items under specific day-of-month (days 1-3 or 25-28), county, household buy-potential (0-500 or 1001-5000), vehicle count >0, and dependent/vehicle ratio >1.2 over years 1998-2000. JOIN semantics: all joins are INNER (intersection), so all dimension filters must match. Aggregation: COUNT(*) is duplicate-sensitive; any join that increases row multiplicity per (ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk) will inflate counts. Filter dependencies: the CASE filter on hd_vehicle_count depends on hd_vehicle_count >0 (already in WHERE), and uses hd_dep_count/hd_vehicle_count >1.2.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Reordering joins may conflict with optimizer's cost-based decision.
- Must ensure fact_store_join doesn't blow up row count (store join is selective).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. or_to_union (Q90: 0.59x):
   CAUSE: Split same-column OR (time range) into UNION ALL, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR on d_dom (same column) or hd_buy_potential (same column).
2. dimension_cte_isolate (Q26: 0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs, causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join dimension CTEs; join them through fact table.
3. date_cte_isolate (Q31: 0.49x):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline 557ms, CTE overhead acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, filters, output columns).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: d_dom ranges, hd_buy_potential strings, hd_vehicle_count >0, 1.2 ratio, years 1998-2000, county list.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, same ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Predicates on dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) could be isolated into CTEs to guarantee early filtering before fact join.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- early_filter (Q11): Apply filtering of small dimension table (store) first, then join with fact. IGNORE the reason table — we have store.
- dimension_cte_isolate (Q26): Apply pre-filtering of store dimension. IGNORE the other dimensions — we handle them sequentially.
- prefetch_fact_join (Q63): Apply staged join but starting with most selective dimension (store). IGNORE the date-first order.

## Original SQL

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `c_salutation`
  4. `c_preferred_cust_flag`
  5. `ss_ticket_number`
  6. `cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Count line items per ticket and customer for filtered store-sales rows, retain ticket groups with counts between 15 and 20, join to customer, and output ordered identity and ticket fields.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (cnt BETWEEN 15 AND 20)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (c_last_name ASC, c_first_name ASC, c_salutation ASC, c_preferred_cust_flag DESC, ss_ticket_number ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_last_name, c_first_name, c_salutation, c_preferred_cust_flag, ss_ticket_number, cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
