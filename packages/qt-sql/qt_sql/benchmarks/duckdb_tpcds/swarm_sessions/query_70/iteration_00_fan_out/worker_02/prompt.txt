You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Rank state and county net profit over month sequence 1213-1224 for top-performing states, using hierarchy-aware rollups and within-parent ranking. INNER joins require all three tables (store_sales, date_dim, store) to match. Aggregation uses SUM(ss_net_profit) which is duplicate-sensitive but safe if join multiplicity preserved. The subquery's top-5 state filter depends on the same date range and store filter as main query.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must handle NULLs in s_state/s_county for levels 1 and 2 correctly
- UNION ALL may change row order; must maintain ORDER BY as in original

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do not convert IN subquery to materialized CTE if it can remain as semi-join
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Do not split OR on same column (d_month_seq range is single predicate)
3. date_cte_isolate (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 1465ms, CTE overhead acceptable

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output total_sum, s_state, s_county, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent exactly
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_net_profit, s_state, s_county, and grouping indicators
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224, s_store_sk<=100, ranking<=5 must be preserved
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Same rows and ordering (lochierarchy desc, case when, rank_within_parent)
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned twice in EXPLAIN
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Subquery and main query share filters but computed separately
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: ROLLUP aggregation is expensive single operation

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

rollup_to_union_windowing: Apply explicit UNION ALL of three aggregation levels; ignore the window function placement (keep at end).
union_cte_split: Apply splitting of generic aggregation into specialized CTEs per level; ignore the year filter aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
```
[item_sums]:

```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```
[detailed]:
```sql
SELECT net_profit / sales_price AS gross_margin, i_category, i_class, 0 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[category_summary]:
```sql

```
[grand_total]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, NULL AS i_category, NULL AS i_class, 2 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[all_levels]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM detailed UNION ALL SELECT * FROM category_summary UNION ALL SELECT * FROM grand_total
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy < 2 THEN RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ORDER BY gross_margin ASC) ELSE 1 END AS rank_within_parent FROM all_levels ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100
```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `total_sum`
  2. `s_state`
  3. `s_county`
  4. `lochierarchy`
  5. `rank_within_parent`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store net profit by ROLLUP(s_state, s_county) for the target months, restrict states to a top-ranked set from a subquery, and compute hierarchy-level ranks with window functions.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim AS d1 (join), store (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11)
    ├── FILTER (? op s_state)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END ASC, rank_within_parent ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (total_sum, s_state, s_county, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
