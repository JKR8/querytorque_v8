You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Rank state and county net profit over month sequence 1213-1224 for top-performing states, using hierarchy-aware rollups and within-parent ranking. INNER joins require all three tables (store_sales, date_dim, store) to match. Aggregation uses SUM(ss_net_profit) which is duplicate-sensitive but safe if join multiplicity preserved. The subquery's top-5 state filter depends on the same date range and store filter as main query.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure state_derived aggregates from county_base, not from joined_fact directly (to avoid double work)
- ranking computed on state_sum must match original subquery logic
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines single-pass scanning with early state aggregation derivation)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do not convert IN subquery to materialized CTE if it can remain as semi-join
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Do not split OR on same column (d_month_seq range is single predicate)
3. date_cte_isolate (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query baseline is 1465ms, CTE overhead acceptable

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output total_sum, s_state, s_county, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent exactly
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_net_profit, s_state, s_county, and grouping indicators
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1224, s_store_sk<=100, ranking<=5 must be preserved
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Same rows and ordering (lochierarchy desc, case when, rank_within_parent)
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: store_sales scanned twice in EXPLAIN
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Subquery and main query share filters but computed separately
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: ROLLUP aggregation is expensive single operation

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

single_pass_aggregation: Apply the single scan of store_sales; ignore the CASE WHEN conditional aggregation.
decorrelate: Apply the decorrelation of the IN subquery by pre-computing top states; ignore the EXISTS pattern.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) end bucket3,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) > 3188917
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid1, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid2, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid3, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid4, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid5 FROM store_sales
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql

   ,store
 where
    d1.d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
 and s_state in
             ( select s_state
               from  (select s_state as s_state,
 			    rank() over ( partition by s_state order by sum(ss_net_profit) desc) as ranking
                      from   store_sales, store, date_dim
                      where  d_month_seq between 1213 and 1213+11
 			    and d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
 			    and s_store_sk  = ss_store_sk
                      group by s_state
                     ) tmp1 
               where ranking <= 5
             )
 group by rollup(s_state,s_county)
 order by
   lochierarchy desc
  ,case when lochierarchy = 0 then s_state end
  ,rank_within_parent
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 70 in stream 0 using template query70.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `total_sum`
  2. `s_state`
  3. `s_county`
  4. `lochierarchy`
  5. `rank_within_parent`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate store net profit by ROLLUP(s_state, s_county) for the target months, restrict states to a top-ranked set from a subquery, and compute hierarchy-level ranks with window functions.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, date_dim AS d1 (join), store (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d1.d_month_seq BETWEEN 1213 AND 1213 + 11)
    ├── FILTER (? op s_state)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN s_state END ASC, rank_within_parent ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (total_sum, s_state, s_county, lochierarchy, rank_within_parent)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
