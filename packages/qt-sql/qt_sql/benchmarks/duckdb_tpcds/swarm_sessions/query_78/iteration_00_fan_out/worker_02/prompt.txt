You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare store channel quantity/value against combined web+catalog for same customer-item-year in 2000, excluding returned transactions. JOIN semantics: store CTE (ss) is driving left side; web/catalog CTEs left-joined on year-item-customer intersection. Aggregation trap: SUM aggregates are duplicate-insensitive but must preserve same group membership (year, item_sk, customer_sk). Filter dependencies: year=2000 filter applies to all channels; NULL check on return keys filters non-returned rows; main query's OR(ws_qty>0, cs_qty>0) must remain after joins.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL may increase intermediate rows (8.8M vs original 4.9M+1.3M+2.6M separately).
- Must ensure each branch includes correct column aliases for consistent joins.
- Pivoting via self-joins on sales_combined may be costly if not indexed.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (regression_q31_pushdown):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs but kept original unfiltered versions, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When creating date_2000 CTE, remove original date_dim joins from channel CTEs and join to date_2000 instead.
2. pushdown (regression_q74_pushdown):
   CAUSE: Split UNION CTE by year but kept original UNION CTE, causing redundant computation.
   RULE: When splitting CTEs by year, eliminate the original generic CTE entirely.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output ss_item_sk, ratio, store_qty, store_wholesale_cost, store_sales_price, other_chan_qty, other_chan_wholesale_cost, other_chan_sales_price in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each channel CTE must output sold_year, item_sk, customer_sk, qty, wc, sp for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Year value 2000 must remain exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Same rows, ordering (8-column ORDER BY), and limit 100.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each CTE independently scans date_dim filtered to year=2000 (3 scans of same 366 rows).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times; opportunity to share.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: consolidate multiple fact scans into UNION ALL with same structure; ignore CASE pivoting (different tables).
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: apply consolidation of repeated scans; ignore bitmap technique (not needed).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ss_item_sk`
  2. `ratio`
  3. `store_qty`
  4. `store_wholesale_cost`
  5. `store_sales_price`
  6. `other_chan_qty`
  7. `other_chan_wholesale_cost`
  8. `other_chan_sales_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] cs  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate yearly non-returned catalog quantities, wholesale cost, and sales price by item and billing customer.
│   ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, catalog_returns (join), date_dim (join))
│   ├── FILTER (cr_order_number IS NULL)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (cs_sold_year, cs_item_sk, cs_customer_sk, cs_qty, cs_wc, cs_sp)
├── [CTE] ss  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate yearly non-returned store quantities, wholesale cost, and sales price by item and customer.

├── [CTE] ws  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate yearly non-returned web quantities, wholesale cost, and sales price by item and billing customer.

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Left-join store aggregates to web and catalog aggregates on year/item/customer, keep rows with other-channel activity, and report store-to-other-channel quantity ratio and value comparisons.
    ├── SCAN (ss, ws (join), cs (join))
    ├── FILTER ((COALESCE(ws_qty, 0) > 0 OR COALESCE(cs_qty, 0) > 0))
    ├── FILTER (ss_sold_year = 2000)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ss_item_sk ASC, ss_qty DESC, ss_wc DESC, ss_sp DESC, other_chan_qty ASC, other_chan_wholesale_cost ASC, other_chan_sales_price ASC, ratio ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ss_item_sk, ratio, store_qty, store_wholesale_cost, store_sales_price, other_chan_qty, other_chan_wholesale_cost, other_chan_sales_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
