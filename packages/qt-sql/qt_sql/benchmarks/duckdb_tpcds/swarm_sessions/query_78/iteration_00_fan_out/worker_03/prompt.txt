You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare store channel quantity/value against combined web+catalog for same customer-item-year in 2000, excluding returned transactions. JOIN semantics: store CTE (ss) is driving left side; web/catalog CTEs left-joined on year-item-customer intersection. Aggregation trap: SUM aggregates are duplicate-insensitive but must preserve same group membership (year, item_sk, customer_sk). Filter dependencies: year=2000 filter applies to all channels; NULL check on return keys filters non-returned rows; main query's OR(ws_qty>0, cs_qty>0) must remain after joins.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must eliminate original generic CTEs (ws, cs, ss) that group by all years.
- Year filter pushdown may already be optimized by engine; ensure not duplicating work.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (regression_q31_pushdown):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs but kept original unfiltered versions, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When creating date_2000 CTE, remove original date_dim joins from channel CTEs and join to date_2000 instead.
2. pushdown (regression_q74_pushdown):
   CAUSE: Split UNION CTE by year but kept original UNION CTE, causing redundant computation.
   RULE: When splitting CTEs by year, eliminate the original generic CTE entirely.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output ss_item_sk, ratio, store_qty, store_wholesale_cost, store_sales_price, other_chan_qty, other_chan_wholesale_cost, other_chan_sales_price in exact order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Each channel CTE must output sold_year, item_sk, customer_sk, qty, wc, sp for downstream joins.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Year value 2000 must remain exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Same rows, ordering (8-column ORDER BY), and limit 100.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Each CTE independently scans date_dim filtered to year=2000 (3 scans of same 366 rows).
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3 times; opportunity to share.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: apply splitting generic CTE by year; ignore UNION structure (not present).
- early_filter: push year filter into CTE definitions; ignore dimension pre-filtering (already done).
- pushdown: push year filter from main query into CTEs; ignore consolidation aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

 select c_customer_id customer_id
       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ss_item_sk`
  2. `ratio`
  3. `store_qty`
  4. `store_wholesale_cost`
  5. `store_sales_price`
  6. `other_chan_qty`
  7. `other_chan_wholesale_cost`
  8. `other_chan_sales_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] cs  [=]  Cost: 25%  Rows: ~1K  — Aggregate yearly non-returned catalog quantities, wholesale cost, and sales price by item and billing customer.
│   ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, catalog_returns (join), date_dim (join))
│   ├── FILTER (cr_order_number IS NULL)

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
