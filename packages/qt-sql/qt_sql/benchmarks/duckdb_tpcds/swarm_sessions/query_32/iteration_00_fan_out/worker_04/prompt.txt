You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum catalog discount amounts for manufacturer 29 items sold in a 90-day window from 1999-01-07 where each row's discount exceeds 130% of that item's average discount in the same window. JOIN semantics are INNER (all three tables must match). The subquery's AVG is grouping-sensitive - must be computed per item within the date window. The outer filter depends on the correlated subquery result, which itself depends on the outer i_item_sk via correlation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_dates -> filtered_items -> sales_window_agg -> final_filter
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_dates:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    OUTPUT: d_date_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 91
    CONSUMERS: sales_window_agg
  filtered_items:
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_manufact_id = 29
    OUTPUT: i_item_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 193
    CONSUMERS: sales_window_agg
  sales_window_agg:
    FROM: catalog_sales cs
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_dates d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_items i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
    WINDOW: AVG(cs.cs_ext_discount_amt) OVER (PARTITION BY cs.cs_item_sk) as item_avg_discount
    OUTPUT: cs.cs_ext_discount_amt, item_avg_discount
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~753
    CONSUMERS: final_filter
  final_filter:
    FROM: sales_window_agg
    WHERE: cs_ext_discount_amt > 1.3 * item_avg_discount
    AGGREGATE: SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"
    OUTPUT: "excess discount amount"
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: none

NODE_CONTRACTS:
filtered_dates:
    FROM: date_dim
    WHERE: d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
    OUTPUT: d_date_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 91
    CONSUMERS: sales_window_agg
  filtered_items:
    FROM: item
    WHERE: i_manufact_id = 29
    OUTPUT: i_item_sk
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 193
    CONSUMERS: sales_window_agg
  sales_window_agg:
    FROM: catalog_sales cs
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_dates d ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN: INNER JOIN filtered_items i ON cs.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk

    CONSUMERS: final_filter
  final_filter:
    FROM: sales_window_agg
    WHERE: cs_ext_discount_amt > 1.3 * item_avg_discount
    AGGREGATE: SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) as "excess discount amount"
    OUTPUT: "excess discount amount"
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: none

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function may compute average over entire partition before filtering by date (but date filter applied before window via join).
- Must ensure window function partitions by cs_item_sk only, not by date range (average should be over same date window as outer row).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (window function + early dimension filtering to eliminate redundant scan while maintaining correlation semantics)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do NOT convert correlated subquery to materialized CTE if it would scan entire fact table.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined fact table with dimension CTE before multi-way fact join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Keep join order flexible when query has complex multi-table joins.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, duplicating work.
   RULE: When splitting, eliminate the original generic CTE entirely.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly one column "excess discount amount" as SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_ext_discount_amt for downstream joins and aggregates.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manufact_id=29, date range '1999-01-07' to +90 days.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same sum of qualifying discounts.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scanned twice with same date filter (403K+397K rows).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned twice (91 rows each).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Use window function instead of CASE aggregates; ignore CASE structure.
- deferred_window_aggregation: Compute window function after joins reduce dataset; ignore the FULL OUTER JOIN complexity.
- SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW: Replace self-join (correlated subquery) with window function; ignore that example used group-level values.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216

                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid1, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid2, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid3, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid4, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid5 FROM store_sales
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `excess discount amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales with item and date, apply manufacturer and date-window filters, and use a correlated subquery to compare each row's discount against 1.3x the item-specific average discount.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id = 29)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    └── OUTPUT (excess discount amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
