You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum catalog discount amounts for manufacturer 29 items sold in a 90-day window from 1999-01-07 where each row's discount exceeds 130% of that item's average discount in the same window. JOIN semantics are INNER (all three tables must match). The subquery's AVG is grouping-sensitive - must be computed per item within the date window. The outer filter depends on the correlated subquery result, which itself depends on the outer i_item_sk via correlation.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

    OUTPUT: "excess discount amount"
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1
    CONSUMERS: none

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function may materialize all rows before filtering; verify EXPLAIN doesn't show huge intermediate.
- Must ensure AVG is computed over same date window as outer rows (already filtered by date join).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do NOT convert correlated subquery to materialized CTE if it would scan entire fact table.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-joined fact table with dimension CTE before multi-way fact join, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Keep join order flexible when query has complex multi-table joins.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, duplicating work.
   RULE: When splitting, eliminate the original generic CTE entirely.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly one column "excess discount amount" as SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include cs_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk, cs_ext_discount_amt for downstream joins and aggregates.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manufact_id=29, date range '1999-01-07' to +90 days.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same sum of qualifying discounts.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scanned twice with same date filter (403K+397K rows).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned twice (91 rows each).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply CASE/OVER pattern to compute item average in same scan as outer rows; ignore that Q9 had multiple scalar subqueries - we have one correlated subquery.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use window function (PARTITION BY cs_item_sk) instead of CASE; ignore the multiple channel buckets - we have one bucket.
- pushdown: Consolidate two catalog_sales scans into one; ignore that Q9 had 15+ subqueries.

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 3. pushdown (2.11x)

## Original SQL

```sql

select sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount" 
from 
   catalog_sales 
   ,item 
   ,date_dim
where
i_manufact_id = 29
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk 
and d_date between '1999-01-07' and 
        (cast('1999-01-07' as date) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk 
and cs_ext_discount_amt  
     > ( 
         select 
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `excess discount amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales with item and date, apply manufacturer and date-window filters, and use a correlated subquery to compare each row's discount against 1.3x the item-specific average discount.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = cs_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id = 29)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    └── OUTPUT (excess discount amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
