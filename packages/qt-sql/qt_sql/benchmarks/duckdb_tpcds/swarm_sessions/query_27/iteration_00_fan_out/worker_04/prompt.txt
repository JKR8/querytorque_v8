You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Compute average sales metrics for 1999 store sales to female, divorced, secondary-educated customers in six states, with rollup subtotals by item and state. JOIN semantics are INNER joins on surrogate keys, requiring matches in all five tables. Aggregation uses AVG, which is sensitive to row duplication from joins; ensure joins do not multiply rows. Filters on customer_demographics, date_dim, and store are independent; missing any filter changes the result set.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-aggregation must preserve all rows needed for final ROLLUP. Grouping by ss_item_sk, s_state is correct because i_item_id is determined by ss_item_sk (functional dependency). However, ROLLUP also includes subtotals where s_state is NULL; pre-aggregation at (ss_item_sk, s_state) level still allows rolling up to (i_item_id) and overall.
- AVG must be computed as SUM/COUNT; ensure COUNT counts non-null values? AVG ignores NULLs; if ss_quantity can be NULL, need COUNT(ss_quantity) not COUNT(*). Use COUNT(column) as above.
- The pre_aggregate CTE may not reduce rows significantly if each (ss_item_sk, s_state) combination is unique.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines star_join_prefetch with aggregate_pushdown)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Prefetch_fact_join (observed regression 0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering and materializing fact tables before 3+ fact table joins prevents optimizer join reordering.
   RULE: Avoid materializing fact table CTEs when the query has multiple fact table joins (this query has only one fact table).
2. Dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Ensure every dimension CTE has a WHERE clause that reduces rows (all dimensions here have filters).
3. Rollup_to_union_windowing (no regression observed but caution):
   CAUSE: Replacing efficient ROLLUP with UNION ALL may increase complexity if ROLLUP is already optimal.
   RULE: Only apply if ROLLUP is inefficient (few groups? 74K groups here, but aggregation is cheap 40ms).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state, avg(ss_quantity) agg1, avg(ss_list_price) agg2, avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) agg4.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., surrogate keys for joins, grouping columns, aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: cd_gender='F', cd_marital_status='D', cd_education_status='Secondary', d_year=1999, s_state IN ('MO','AL','MI','TN','LA','SC').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, order, and grouping as original ROLLUP with ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The optimizer pushes filters into scans but may not push multiple dimension filters into the fact scan simultaneously. The fact table scan currently reads 5.5M rows; pre-filtering dimensions could reduce this via early semi-joins.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: The ROLLUP generates three grouping levels; splitting into explicit UNION ALL could allow per-level optimization.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Use partial aggregation (SUM/COUNT) before joining with a dimension, then compute final AVG. Ignore the multiple subquery consolidation.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Consolidate multiple scans into one; here we aggregate before a dimension join to reduce rows. Ignore the CASE WHEN labeling.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `s_state`
  3. `g_state`
  4. `agg1`
  5. `agg2`
  6. `agg3`
  7. `agg4`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with demographics, date, store, and item; apply year/state/demographic filters; aggregate averages under ROLLUP(i_item_id, s_state); and return ordered rows including grouping-state flags.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), store (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status = 'D')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC, s_state ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, s_state, g_state, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
