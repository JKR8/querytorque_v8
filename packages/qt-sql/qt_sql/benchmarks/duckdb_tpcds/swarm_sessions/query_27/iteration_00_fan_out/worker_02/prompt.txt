You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Compute average sales metrics for 1999 store sales to female, divorced, secondary-educated customers in six states, with rollup subtotals by item and state. JOIN semantics are INNER joins on surrogate keys, requiring matches in all five tables. Aggregation uses AVG, which is sensitive to row duplication from joins; ensure joins do not multiply rows. Filters on customer_demographics, date_dim, and store are independent; missing any filter changes the result set.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

    CONSUMERS: final output

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must compute GROUPING(s_state) correctly: when s_state is NULL and grouping_level=1 or 2, g_state should be 1? Actually GROUPING(s_state) returns 1 when s_state is aggregated (i.e., level1 and level0). We can derive from grouping_level.
- The base_joined CTE is scanned three times (once per level). If not materialized, may be re-executed thrice, increasing store_sales scan cost. Consider materializing base_joined if referenced multiple times.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Prefetch_fact_join (observed regression 0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering and materializing fact tables before 3+ fact table joins prevents optimizer join reordering.
   RULE: Avoid materializing fact table CTEs when the query has multiple fact table joins (this query has only one fact table).
2. Dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Ensure every dimension CTE has a WHERE clause that reduces rows (all dimensions here have filters).
3. Rollup_to_union_windowing (no regression observed but caution):
   CAUSE: Replacing efficient ROLLUP with UNION ALL may increase complexity if ROLLUP is already optimal.
   RULE: Only apply if ROLLUP is inefficient (few groups? 74K groups here, but aggregation is cheap 40ms).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, s_state, grouping(s_state) g_state, avg(ss_quantity) agg1, avg(ss_list_price) agg2, avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(ss_sales_price) agg4.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (e.g., surrogate keys for joins, grouping columns, aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve literal values: cd_gender='F', cd_marital_status='D', cd_education_status='Secondary', d_year=1999, s_state IN ('MO','AL','MI','TN','LA','SC').
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, order, and grouping as original ROLLUP with ORDER BY i_item_id, s_state.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The optimizer pushes filters into scans but may not push multiple dimension filters into the fact scan simultaneously. The fact table scan currently reads 5.5M rows; pre-filtering dimensions could reduce this via early semi-joins.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: The ROLLUP generates three grouping levels; splitting into explicit UNION ALL could allow per-level optimization.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- rollup_to_union_windowing (Q36): Replace GROUP BY ROLLUP with explicit UNION ALL of three aggregation levels. Ignore the windowing/ranking aspect (this query has no window functions).
- union_cte_split (Q74): Split a generic CTE into specialized ones; here we split aggregation levels. Ignore the year-splitting aspect.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. rollup_to_union_windowing (2.47x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin, i_category, i_class, grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class) as lochierarchy, rank() over (partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class), case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent from store_sales, date_dim d1, item, store where d1.d_year = 2002 and d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and i_item_sk = ss_item_sk and s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and s_state in ('SD','TN','GA','SC','MO','AL','MI','OH') group by rollup(i_category,i_class) order by lochierarchy desc, case when lochierarchy = 0 then i_category end, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2002
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
```
[item_sums]:
```sql

```
[item_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT i.i_category, i.i_class, SUM(item_sums.net_profit) AS net_profit, SUM(item_sums.sales_price) AS sales_price FROM item_sums JOIN item i ON item_sums.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class
```
[detailed]:
```sql
SELECT net_profit / sales_price AS gross_margin, i_category, i_class, 0 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[category_summary]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, i_category, NULL AS i_class, 1 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0 GROUP BY i_category
```
[grand_total]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(net_profit) / SUM(sales_price) AS gross_margin, NULL AS i_category, NULL AS i_class, 2 AS lochierarchy FROM item_aggregates WHERE sales_price <> 0
```
[all_levels]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM detailed UNION ALL SELECT * FROM category_summary UNION ALL SELECT * FROM grand_total
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT gross_margin, i_category, i_class, lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy < 2 THEN RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY lochierarchy, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END ORDER BY gross_margin ASC) ELSE 1 END AS rank_within_parent FROM all_levels ORDER BY lochierarchy DESC, CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END, rank_within_parent LIMIT 100
```

### 2. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

         and t_w_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and case when t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_w_secyear.year_total / t_w_firstyear.year_total else null end

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `s_state`
  3. `g_state`
  4. `agg1`
  5. `agg2`
  6. `agg3`
  7. `agg4`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with demographics, date, store, and item; apply year/state/demographic filters; aggregate averages under ROLLUP(i_item_id, s_state); and return ordered rows including grouping-state flags.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join), store (join), item (join))
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (cd_gender = 'F')
    ├── FILTER (cd_marital_status = 'D')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC, s_state ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, s_state, g_state, agg1, agg2, agg3, agg4)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
