You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return items within price band [45,75] from specific manufacturers that had inventory between 100-500 units during a 60-day window starting 1999-02-21 and also appear in catalog sales. JOIN semantics: INNER joins require all four tables to match (intersection). No aggregation functions exist; GROUP BY only deduplicates catalog_sales duplicates. Filter dependencies: item filters (price, manufacturer) independent; inventory quantity filter independent; date filter independent; catalog_sales existence check depends on item_sk only.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- This is essentially the original plan structure (joins before group). May not improve.
- Risk of Cartesian explosion if joins reordered poorly.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (testing if explicit join order with CTEs improves over optimizer's hash join choice)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 128ms (>100ms), so CTE likely beneficial but keep minimal.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: Our baseline 128ms >50ms, acceptable but limit CTE chain length.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS pattern to materialized CTE; preserve semi-join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream (especially i_item_sk for joins).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literals: 45, 30, '1999-02-21', 60, 856,707,1000,747, 100, 500.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 3 rows ordered by i_item_id.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows filters applied in scans but catalog_sales scan lacks predicate on item_sk list.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (each table scanned once).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN: Apply pushing GROUP BY below catalog_sales join? Actually we push GROUP BY after all joins but before final SELECT; ignore that original query already has GROUP BY at end.
- single_pass_aggregation: Not applicable (no multiple scans); ignore.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Not applicable; ignore.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. AGGREGATE_PUSH_BELOW_JOIN (unknown)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
SELECT c.region, SUM(o.amount)
      FROM customers c
      JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
      GROUP BY c.region;
```

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_current_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join item, inventory, date, and catalog sales; apply price, manufacturer, inventory-level, and date-window filters; then return grouped item identity and current price rows.
    ├── SCAN (item, inventory (join), date_dim (join), catalog_sales (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = inv_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_current_price BETWEEN 45 AND 45 + 30)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
