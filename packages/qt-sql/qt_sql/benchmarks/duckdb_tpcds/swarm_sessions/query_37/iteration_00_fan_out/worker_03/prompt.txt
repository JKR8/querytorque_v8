You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return items within price band [45,75] from specific manufacturers that had inventory between 100-500 units during a 60-day window starting 1999-02-21 and also appear in catalog sales. JOIN semantics: INNER joins require all four tables to match (intersection). No aggregation functions exist; GROUP BY only deduplicates catalog_sales duplicates. Filter dependencies: item filters (price, manufacturer) independent; inventory quantity filter independent; date filter independent; catalog_sales existence check depends on item_sk only.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Grouping before catalog_sales join may incorrectly filter items that have catalog sales but multiple inventory rows? Actually safe because we keep i_item_sk for join.
- Still does INNER JOIN with catalog_sales, may blow up but on already reduced set.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 128ms (>100ms), so CTE likely beneficial but keep minimal.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: Our baseline 128ms >50ms, acceptable but limit CTE chain length.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS pattern to materialized CTE; preserve semi-join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream (especially i_item_sk for joins).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literals: 45, 30, '1999-02-21', 60, 856,707,1000,747, 100, 500.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 3 rows ordered by i_item_id.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows filters applied in scans but catalog_sales scan lacks predicate on item_sk list.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (each table scanned once).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- deferred_window_aggregation: Apply delaying expensive operation (catalog_sales join) until after reduction; ignore window functions.
- late_attribute_binding: Apply deferring catalog_sales join until after filtering and grouping; verify columns needed for join (i_item_sk) are preserved.
- pushdown: Push filters from original query into CTEs; already done.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select

  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative

                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y

```

**AFTER (fast):**

```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_current_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join item, inventory, date, and catalog sales; apply price, manufacturer, inventory-level, and date-window filters; then return grouped item identity and current price rows.
    ├── SCAN (item, inventory (join), date_dim (join), catalog_sales (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = inv_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_current_price BETWEEN 45 AND 45 + 30)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
