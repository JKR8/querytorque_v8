You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return items within price band [45,75] from specific manufacturers that had inventory between 100-500 units during a 60-day window starting 1999-02-21 and also appear in catalog sales. JOIN semantics: INNER joins require all four tables to match (intersection). No aggregation functions exist; GROUP BY only deduplicates catalog_sales duplicates. Filter dependencies: item filters (price, manufacturer) independent; inventory quantity filter independent; date filter independent; catalog_sales existence check depends on item_sk only.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Removing GROUP BY may change results if same item has multiple inventory rows (still same item attributes). Keep GROUP BY for safety.
- EXISTS may perform worse if catalog_sales has poor correlation with item_sk.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 128ms (>100ms), so CTE likely beneficial but keep minimal.
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: Our baseline 128ms >50ms, acceptable but limit CTE chain length.
3. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS pattern to materialized CTE; preserve semi-join.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include all columns referenced downstream (especially i_item_sk for joins).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve exact literals: 45, 30, '1999-02-21', 60, 856,707,1000,747, 100, 500.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 3 rows ordered by i_item_id.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows filters applied in scans but catalog_sales scan lacks predicate on item_sk list.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (each table scanned once).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- intersect_to_exists: Apply conversion of INNER JOIN+GROUP BY to EXISTS; ignore INTERSECT pattern (we have no INTERSECT).
- multi_intersect_exists_cte: Apply EXISTS with pre-filtered dimension CTEs; ignore cascading INTERSECT.
- decorrelate: Not applicable (no correlated subquery to decorrelate); ignore.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

### 3. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**

SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 37 in stream 0 using template query37.tpl
select i_item_id
       ,i_item_desc
       ,i_current_price

 and inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
 and d_date_sk=inv_date_sk
 and d_date between cast('1999-02-21' as date) and (cast('1999-02-21' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)

 and inv_quantity_on_hand between 100 and 500
 and cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
 group by i_item_id,i_item_desc,i_current_price
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 37 in stream 0 using template query37.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_current_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join item, inventory, date, and catalog sales; apply price, manufacturer, inventory-level, and date-window filters; then return grouped item identity and current price rows.
    ├── SCAN (item, inventory (join), date_dim (join), catalog_sales (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = inv_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (i_current_price BETWEEN 45 AND 45 + 30)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1999-02-21' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+2 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_item_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
