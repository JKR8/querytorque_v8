You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum Q1 2001 catalog sales by billing ZIP for customers selected by either a target ZIP list, a target state list, or high transaction amount (>500). Joins are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregation uses SUM, which is duplicate-sensitive – if a sale satisfies multiple OR conditions, it must be counted once. The OR filter depends on columns from two tables (customer_address, catalog_sales), preventing independent predicate pushdown.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- IN-subquery may become a semi-join; ensure the subquery is efficient.
  - Must preserve all original filters in main_join (date condition already in filtered_date).
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Baseline <100ms (regression_q25_pushdown):
   CAUSE: CTE materialization overhead dominates on fast queries.
   RULE: Minimize CTE count and ensure each CTE has high selectivity.
2. OR-to-UNION same-column split (regression_q90):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR (t_hour >=8 OR t_hour <=17) duplicated fact scans.
   RULE: This query has OR on different columns (zip, state, price) – safe to split.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output ca_zip and sum(cs_sales_price) exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include cs_sales_price, ca_zip, and join keys (cs_bill_customer_sk, c_current_addr_sk, etc.).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve all literal values: ZIP list, states ('CA','WA','GA'), sales_price > 500, d_qoy=1, d_year=2001.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows, same ordering (ca_zip ASC), same limit 100.
- CROSS_COLUMN_OR_DECOMPOSITION: OR spans ca_zip, ca_state, cs_sales_price – prevents optimal scan paths.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: OR condition not pushed into dimension scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the DISTINCT customer key extraction from composite_decorrelate_union; apply the IN-subquery pattern from intersect_to_exists (converting OR to IN). Ignore the EXISTS correlation – this query has no EXISTS.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

**BEFORE (slow):**

  cd_dep_employed_count,
  count(*) cnt2,
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  sum(cd_dep_employed_count),
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),

          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and

    exists (select * 
            from catalog_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk and

```

### 2. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_zip`
  2. `SUM(cs_sales_price)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join catalog sales with customer, address, and date; apply the OR-based geographic/high-value customer filter; aggregate sales by ZIP; and return ZIP-sorted totals.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales, customer (join), customer_address (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── JOIN (c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER ((SUBSTRING(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') OR ca_state IN ('CA', 'WA', 'GA') OR cs_sales_price > 500))
    ├── FILTER (d_qoy = 1)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_zip ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
