You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum web discount amounts for manufacturer 320 items sold in a 90-day window from 2002-02-26 where each row's discount exceeds 130% of that item's average discount in the same window. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in item, date, and web_sales. The AVG in the subquery is duplicate-sensitive; any rewrite must preserve the per-item grouping defined by the correlation on i_item_sk. The outer filter i_manufact_id = 320 must also apply to the subquery’s item average to maintain correctness.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function AVG over partition by ws_item_sk must be computed over the same date range as outer; ensured by filtered_date join.
- Window function may be computed over all rows in the partition, which matches the subquery’s logic (same date filter). Safe.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert correlated subquery to materialized CTE if it is used as a filter with early termination; ours is an aggregate join, safe.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 117ms, acceptable for CTE materialization.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep joins sequential.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly "Excess Discount Amount" as sum(ws_ext_discount_amt).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ws_ext_discount_amt, ws_item_sk, ws_sold_date_sk, i_item_sk, i_manufact_id, d_date_sk, d_date as needed by downstream nodes.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manufact_id=320, date range '2002-02-26' to +90 days, and multiplier 1.3.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match original (ORDER BY sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) LIMIT 100).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Subquery missing i_manufact_id filter, causing extra scan.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: web_sales scanned twice; date_dim and item scanned twice each.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Consolidate the two web_sales scans into one by computing the per-item average via window function; ignore the CASE aggregation (not needed).
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use a single scan with added computation (window) to avoid separate subquery scan; ignore the labeling and conditional aggregation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Excess Discount Amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with item and date, filter by manufacturer and date range, compare each row discount to a correlated 1.3x item-average discount threshold, and aggregate qualifying excess discount amount.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ws_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id = 320)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-02-26' AND (CAST('2002-02-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (Excess Discount Amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
