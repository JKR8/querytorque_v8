You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum web discount amounts for manufacturer 320 items sold in a 90-day window from 2002-02-26 where each row's discount exceeds 130% of that item's average discount in the same window. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in item, date, and web_sales. The AVG in the subquery is duplicate-sensitive; any rewrite must preserve the per-item grouping defined by the correlation on i_item_sk. The outer filter i_manufact_id = 320 must also apply to the subquery’s item average to maintain correctness.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure item_avg_discount includes only items from manufacturer 320, else semantic break.
- Duplicate i_item_sk in filtered_item? No, item is dimension with unique i_item_sk.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert correlated subquery to materialized CTE if it is used as a filter with early termination; ours is an aggregate join, safe.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 117ms, acceptable for CTE materialization.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep joins sequential.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly "Excess Discount Amount" as sum(ws_ext_discount_amt).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ws_ext_discount_amt, ws_item_sk, ws_sold_date_sk, i_item_sk, i_manufact_id, d_date_sk, d_date as needed by downstream nodes.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manufact_id=320, date range '2002-02-26' to +90 days, and multiplier 1.3.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match original (ORDER BY sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) LIMIT 100).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Subquery missing i_manufact_id filter, causing extra scan.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: web_sales scanned twice; date_dim and item scanned twice each.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- decorrelate: Apply the pattern of converting correlated subquery to CTE with GROUP BY; ignore the filter pushdown aspect (our subquery already grouped by item).
- pushdown: Push the i_manufact_id filter into the subquery by joining with filtered_item CTE; ignore the consolidation of multiple subqueries (only one subquery).
- date_cte_isolate: Isolate date filter into CTE and reuse in both outer and subquery; ignore the decomposition of existing CTEs.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales

            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) end bucket3,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) > 3188917
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[quantity_1_20_stats]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(ss_ext_sales_price) AS avg_ext_price, AVG(ss_net_profit) AS avg_net_profit FROM store_sales WHERE ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20
```
[quantity_21_40_stats]:
```sql

```

### 3. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 92 in stream 0 using template query92.tpl
select 
   sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)  as "Excess Discount Amount" 
from 
    web_sales

and i_item_sk = ws_item_sk 
and d_date between '2002-02-26' and 
        (cast('2002-02-26' as date) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk 
and ws_ext_discount_amt  
     > ( 
         SELECT 
            1.3 * avg(ws_ext_discount_amt) 
         FROM 
            web_sales 
           ,date_dim
         WHERE 
              ws_item_sk = i_item_sk 
          and d_date between '2002-02-26' and
                             (cast('2002-02-26' as date) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
          and d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk 
      ) 
order by sum(ws_ext_discount_amt)
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 92 in stream 0 using template query92.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Excess Discount Amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with item and date, filter by manufacturer and date range, compare each row discount to a correlated 1.3x item-average discount threshold, and aggregate qualifying excess discount amount.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ws_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id = 320)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-02-26' AND (CAST('2002-02-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (Excess Discount Amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
