You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Sum web discount amounts for manufacturer 320 items sold in a 90-day window from 2002-02-26 where each row's discount exceeds 130% of that item's average discount in the same window. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matches in item, date, and web_sales. The AVG in the subquery is duplicate-sensitive; any rewrite must preserve the per-item grouping defined by the correlation on i_item_sk. The outer filter i_manufact_id = 320 must also apply to the subquery’s item average to maintain correctness.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- web_sales_filtered CTE is referenced twice (by item_avg_discount and main_join); ensure it is materialized to avoid rescanning.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do not convert correlated subquery to materialized CTE if it is used as a filter with early termination; ours is an aggregate join, safe.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead dominated savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 117ms, acceptable for CTE materialization.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join multiple dimension CTEs; keep joins sequential.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly "Excess Discount Amount" as sum(ws_ext_discount_amt).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ws_ext_discount_amt, ws_item_sk, ws_sold_date_sk, i_item_sk, i_manufact_id, d_date_sk, d_date as needed by downstream nodes.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve i_manufact_id=320, date range '2002-02-26' to +90 days, and multiplier 1.3.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows and ordering must match original (ORDER BY sum(ws_ext_discount_amt) LIMIT 100).
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: Subquery missing i_manufact_id filter, causing extra scan.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: web_sales scanned twice; date_dim and item scanned twice each.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- prefetch_fact_join: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table (web_sales_filtered) before aggregation; ignore the cascading fact-table chains (only one fact table).
- dimension_cte_isolate: Pre-filter item and date into CTEs; ignore the cross-join of dimension CTEs (we join them sequentially with fact).
- multi_dimension_prefetch: Pre-filter both dimensions before fact join; ignore the unfiltered dimension CTE risk (both have WHERE).

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk, ss_store_sk, ss_sales_price, d_moy FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_manager_id, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS sum_sales, AVG(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY i_manager_id) AS avg_monthly_sales FROM item JOIN filtered_sales ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk WHERE ((i_category IN ('Books', 'Children', 'Electronics') AND i_class IN ('personal', 'portable', 'reference', 'self-help') AND i_brand IN (...)) OR (i_category IN ('Women', 'Music', 'Men') AND i_class IN ('accessories', 'classical', 'fragrances', 'pants') AND i_brand IN (...))) GROUP BY i_manager_id, d_moy) AS tmp1 WHERE CASE WHEN avg_monthly_sales > 0 THEN ABS(sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales ELSE NULL END > 0.1 ORDER BY i_manager_id, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 2. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

### 3. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Tuesday') then ss_sales_price else  null end) tue_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_day_name FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_store_id FROM store WHERE s_gmt_offset = -5
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales LIMIT 100

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `Excess Discount Amount`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales with item and date, filter by manufacturer and date range, compare each row discount to a correlated 1.3x item-average discount threshold, and aggregate qualifying excess discount amount.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (i_item_sk = ws_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_manufact_id = 320)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-02-26' AND (CAST('2002-02-26' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    ├── SORT (SUM(ws_ext_discount_amt) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (Excess Discount Amount)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {

    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
