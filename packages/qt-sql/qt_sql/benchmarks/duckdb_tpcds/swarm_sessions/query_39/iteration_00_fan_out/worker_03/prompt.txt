You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare January and February 1998 inventory statistics (mean, coefficient of variation) for warehouse-item combinations with high monthly variability (cov > 1). JOIN semantics: INNER self-join requires both months to exist for same warehouse-item pair. Aggregation trap: STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 non-NULL values per group; changing group partitioning changes results. Filter dependency: cov>1 filter in CTE must apply BEFORE month filtering to preserve semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Check EXPLAIN doesn't already push d_moy filter
- CTE inv_cte still groups by d_moy (needed for self-join)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. pushdown (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered versions of CTEs but kept original unfiltered CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When creating month-specialized CTEs, ELIMINATE the original all-months CTE
2. date_cte_isolate (0.71x on Q1):
   CAUSE: Decomposed well-structured CTE into slower pieces when optimizer already pushed predicates
   RULE: Verify EXPLAIN doesn't already push d_moy filter before applying date isolation
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Don't split d_moy IN (1,2) into UNION - engine handles single-column IN natively

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 10 output columns in exact order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov for downstream self-join
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep d_year=1998, d_moy=1, d_moy=2, cov>1, cov>1.5 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows as original
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows full-year scan despite only needing months 1&2
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single inventory scan could compute both month stats

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- date_cte_isolate: Extract date filtering into separate CTE; apply to months 1&2 only
- early_filter: Filter date dimension first; ignore other dimension filters (item, warehouse already selective)

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[target_month]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1
```
[category_avg_price]:
```sql
SELECT i_category, AVG(i_current_price) * 1.2 AS avg_threshold FROM item GROUP BY i_category
```
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim JOIN target_month ON d_month_seq = target_month.d_month_seq
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, ss_item_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT a.ca_state AS state, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM customer_address a JOIN customer c ON a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk JOIN filtered_sales s ON c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk JOIN item i ON s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk JOIN category_avg_price cap ON i.i_category = cap.i_category WHERE i.i_current_price > cap.avg_threshold GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100
```

### 2. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number
                  ,ss_customer_sk
                  ,case when sr_return_quantity is not null then (ss_quantity-sr_return_quantity)*ss_sales_price
                                                            else (ss_quantity*ss_sales_price) end act_sales
            from store_sales left outer join store_returns on (sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk
                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `w_warehouse_sk`
  2. `i_item_sk`
  3. `d_moy`
  4. `mean`
  5. `cov`
  6. `w_warehouse_sk`
  7. `i_item_sk`
  8. `d_moy`
  9. `mean`
  10. `cov`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```

```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
