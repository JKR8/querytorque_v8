You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare January and February 1998 inventory statistics (mean, coefficient of variation) for warehouse-item combinations with high monthly variability (cov > 1). JOIN semantics: INNER self-join requires both months to exist for same warehouse-item pair. Aggregation trap: STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 non-NULL values per group; changing group partitioning changes results. Filter dependency: cov>1 filter in CTE must apply BEFORE month filtering to preserve semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ELIMINATE original all-months CTE to avoid redundant scan
- Each month CTE scans inventory separately (2 scans vs original 1)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. pushdown (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered versions of CTEs but kept original unfiltered CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When creating month-specialized CTEs, ELIMINATE the original all-months CTE
2. date_cte_isolate (0.71x on Q1):
   CAUSE: Decomposed well-structured CTE into slower pieces when optimizer already pushed predicates
   RULE: Verify EXPLAIN doesn't already push d_moy filter before applying date isolation
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Don't split d_moy IN (1,2) into UNION - engine handles single-column IN natively

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 10 output columns in exact order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov for downstream self-join
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep d_year=1998, d_moy=1, d_moy=2, cov>1, cov>1.5 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows as original
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows full-year scan despite only needing months 1&2
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single inventory scan could compute both month stats

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split: Split generic CTE into month-specialized CTEs; ignore the year-splitting aspect
- shared_dimension_multi_channel: Apply dimension pre-filtering; ignore the multi-channel UNION ALL

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

       ,c_first_name customer_first_name
       ,c_last_name customer_last_name

         and t_w_secyear.year = 1999+1
         and t_s_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0
         and case when t_w_firstyear.year_total > 0 then t_w_secyear.year_total / t_w_firstyear.year_total else null end

### 2. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `w_warehouse_sk`
  2. `i_item_sk`
  3. `d_moy`
  4. `mean`
  5. `cov`
  6. `w_warehouse_sk`
  7. `i_item_sk`
  8. `d_moy`
  9. `mean`
  10. `cov`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] inv  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute monthly mean and standard deviation of on-hand inventory by warehouse and item, derive coefficient of variation, and keep high-variability groups.
│   ├── SCAN (inventory, item, warehouse, date_dim)
│   ├── FILTER (CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN 0 ELSE stdev / mean END > 1)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, cov)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join the variability-filtered inventory summary for month 1 and month 2 on the same warehouse-item keys and return side-by-side monthly statistics.
    ├── SCAN (inv AS inv1 (join), inv AS inv2 (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── FILTER (inv1.d_moy = 1)
    ├── FILTER (inv2.d_moy = 1 + 1)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (inv1.w_warehouse_sk ASC, inv1.i_item_sk ASC, inv1.d_moy ASC, inv1.mean ASC, inv1.cov ASC, inv2.d_moy ASC, inv2.mean ASC, inv2.cov ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
