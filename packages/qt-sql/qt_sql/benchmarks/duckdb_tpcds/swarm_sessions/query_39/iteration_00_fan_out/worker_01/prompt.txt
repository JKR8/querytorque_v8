You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compare January and February 1998 inventory statistics (mean, coefficient of variation) for warehouse-item combinations with high monthly variability (cov > 1). JOIN semantics: INNER self-join requires both months to exist for same warehouse-item pair. Aggregation trap: STDDEV_SAMP requires ≥2 non-NULL values per group; changing group partitioning changes results. Filter dependency: cov>1 filter in CTE must apply BEFORE month filtering to preserve semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- STDDEV_SAMP over CASE returns NULL if <2 non-NULL values - preserves original semantics
- Must compute cov filter PER MONTH before main query

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. pushdown (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered versions of CTEs but kept original unfiltered CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When creating month-specialized CTEs, ELIMINATE the original all-months CTE
2. date_cte_isolate (0.71x on Q1):
   CAUSE: Decomposed well-structured CTE into slower pieces when optimizer already pushed predicates
   RULE: Verify EXPLAIN doesn't already push d_moy filter before applying date isolation
3. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range into UNION branches, duplicating fact scans
   RULE: Don't split d_moy IN (1,2) into UNION - engine handles single-column IN natively

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve all 10 output columns in exact order
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov for downstream self-join
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must keep d_year=1998, d_moy=1, d_moy=2, cov>1, cov>1.5 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return identical rows as original
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows full-year scan despite only needing months 1&2
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Single inventory scan could compute both month stats

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Apply CASE WHEN conditional aggregation for months 1&2 in single GROUP BY; ignore the scalar subquery consolidation aspect
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Apply single scan with CASE labels; ignore the multi-channel aspect (we have months not channels)

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `w_warehouse_sk`
  2. `i_item_sk`
  3. `d_moy`
  4. `mean`
  5. `cov`
  6. `w_warehouse_sk`
  7. `i_item_sk`
  8. `d_moy`
  9. `mean`
  10. `cov`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] inv  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Compute monthly mean and standard deviation of on-hand inventory by warehouse and item, derive coefficient of variation, and keep high-variability groups.
│   ├── SCAN (inventory, item, warehouse, date_dim)
│   ├── FILTER (CASE mean WHEN 0 THEN 0 ELSE stdev / mean END > 1)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_name, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, stdev, mean, cov)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join the variability-filtered inventory summary for month 1 and month 2 on the same warehouse-item keys and return side-by-side monthly statistics.
    ├── SCAN (inv AS inv1 (join), inv AS inv2 (join))
    ├── JOIN (inv1.i_item_sk = inv2.i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (inv1.w_warehouse_sk = inv2.w_warehouse_sk)
    ├── FILTER (inv1.d_moy = 1)
    ├── FILTER (inv2.d_moy = 1 + 1)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (inv1.w_warehouse_sk ASC, inv1.i_item_sk ASC, inv1.d_moy ASC, inv1.mean ASC, inv1.cov ASC, inv2.d_moy ASC, inv2.mean ASC, inv2.cov ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, mean, cov, w_warehouse_sk, i_item_sk, d_moy, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
