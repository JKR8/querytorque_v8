You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute 2000 weekday sales profiles for each store in GMT offset -5, returning Sunday-through-Saturday sales totals per store. JOINs are INNER (all sides must match). Aggregates are SUM with CASE, which are duplicate-safe but require preserving exact row multiplicity from the fact table after dimension filters. Filter dependencies: d_year=2000 and s_gmt_offset=-5 must remain applied to their respective dimension tables; moving these filters to the fact table would be incorrect.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- CROSS JOIN of filtered_date and filtered_store (366*31=11,346) may be larger than individual dimension hash tables, but still small.
- Composite join condition (ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND ss_store_sk = s_store_sk) may not be indexed; could force a less efficient join.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: This strategy does not violate any correctness constraints; it's a novel join ordering.
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. multi_dimension_prefetch (observed regression 0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: Unfiltered dimension CTEs added overhead.
   RULE: Ensure every dimension CTE has a WHERE clause (already satisfied by d_year and s_gmt_offset).
2. prefetch_fact_join (observed regression 0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline query <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: Our baseline is 653ms, so overhead likely acceptable.
3. dimension_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joining 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join more than 2 dimension CTEs; our query only has 2 dimensions.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (surrogate keys, d_day_name, ss_sales_price, s_store_name, s_store_id).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, s_gmt_offset=-5, day name strings exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows store_sales scan is full table; join conditions not pushed into scan.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active but strategy must not introduce redundant scans.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- multi_date_range_cte (Q29): Apply creating separate CTEs for each dimension filter, but combine via CROSS JOIN instead of separate joins. Ignore the multiple date aliases.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Not directly applicable; ignore the bitmap consolidation.
- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Not directly applicable; ignore the aggregation consolidation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name`
  2. `s_store_id`
  3. `sun_sales`
  4. `mon_sales`
  5. `tue_sales`
  6. `wed_sales`
  7. `thu_sales`
  8. `fri_sales`
  9. `sat_sales`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join store sales with date and store, filter to year 2000 and target time-zone offset, then pivot day-of-week sales into separate SUM(CASE) columns per store.
    ├── SCAN (date_dim, store_sales (join), store (join))
    ├── JOIN (d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ss_store_sk)
    ├── FILTER (s_gmt_offset = -5)
    ├── FILTER (d_year = 2000)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (s_store_name ASC, s_store_id ASC, sun_sales ASC, mon_sales ASC, tue_sales ASC, wed_sales ASC, thu_sales ASC, fri_sales ASC, sat_sales ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
