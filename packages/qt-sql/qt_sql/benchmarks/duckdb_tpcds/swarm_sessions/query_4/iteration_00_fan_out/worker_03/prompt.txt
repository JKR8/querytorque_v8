You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers whose catalog sales growth ratio (2000/1999) exceeds both store and web growth ratios, requiring positive 1999 baselines in all three channels. JOIN semantics: all 6 self-joins are INNER on customer_id (intersection) and filter by specific (sale_type, year) pairs. Aggregation trap: SUMs are duplicate-sensitive, but each (customer, year, channel) group is distinct; conditional aggregation with CASE WHEN year=X is safe because each original row belongs to exactly one year. Filter dependencies: year_total>0 filters must be applied after aggregation, and growth ratio comparisons must use the same channel's 1999 and 2000 totals.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must ensure each CTE includes only the required year; do not accidentally include both years.
- The main query now joins 6 CTEs directly; ensure join conditions are correct (all on customer_id).
- Dropping sale_type column from CTEs because each CTE is specific to a channel/year; but we need to know which is which in joins. We'll rely on CTE naming; sale_type not needed in output.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting the CTE into year/channel-specific CTEs, ELIMINATE the original year_total CTE entirely.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE materialization overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 8156ms, so safe to apply.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly columns customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Downstream joins need customer_id, sale_type, year totals; output needs customer attributes.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=1999 and d_year=2000 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with same ordering.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows each fact table scanned twice (once per year); total 6 scans.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 6 times; filter not shared across CTE references.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic CTE year_total is self-joined 6 times with different (sale_type, year) filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- union_cte_split (Q74): Split the generic CTE into year/channel-specific CTEs. IMPORTANT: Eliminate the original year_total CTE entirely.
- rollup_to_union_windowing (Q36): Replace generic grouping with explicit per-level CTEs; we adapt by creating explicit per-year CTEs.
- shared_dimension_multi_channel (Q80): Extract shared date filter? Not needed; each CTE has its own date filter. Ignore the shared dimension extraction.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. union_cte_split (1.36x)

**Principle:** CTE Specialization: when a generic CTE is scanned multiple times with different filters (e.g., by year), split it into specialized CTEs that embed the filter in their definition. Each specialized CTE processes only its relevant subset, eliminating redundant scans.

### 3. shared_dimension_multi_channel (1.30x)

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`
  4. `customer_birth_country`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] year_total  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build per-customer, per-year totals for store, catalog, and web channels using the query's channel-specific profitability formula and label each row with its sale type.
│   ├── SCAN (customer, web_sales (join), date_dim (join), store_sales (join), catalog_sales (join))
│   ├── JOIN (c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_preferred_cust_flag, customer_birth_country, customer_login, customer_email_address, dyear, ...)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join channel/year totals for 1999 and 2000 by customer, enforce positive 1999 baselines, compare growth ratios across channels, and keep customers where catalog growth beats both store and web.
    ├── SCAN (year_total AS t_s_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_s_secyear (join), year_total AS t_c_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_c_secyear (join), year_total AS t_w_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_w_secyear (join))
    ├── JOIN (t_s_secyear.customer_id = t_s_firstyear.customer_id)
    ├── JOIN (t_s_firstyear.customer_id = t_c_secyear.customer_id)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's')
    ├── FILTER (t_c_firstyear.sale_type = 'c')
    ├── FILTER (+15 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (t_s_secyear.customer_id ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_first_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_last_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_birth_country ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
