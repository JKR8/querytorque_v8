You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Find customers whose catalog sales growth ratio (2000/1999) exceeds both store and web growth ratios, requiring positive 1999 baselines in all three channels. JOIN semantics: all 6 self-joins are INNER on customer_id (intersection) and filter by specific (sale_type, year) pairs. Aggregation trap: SUMs are duplicate-sensitive, but each (customer, year, channel) group is distinct; conditional aggregation with CASE WHEN year=X is safe because each original row belongs to exactly one year. Filter dependencies: year_total>0 filters must be applied after aggregation, and growth ratio comparisons must use the same channel's 1999 and 2000 totals.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The sales_union_agg CTE may be large (union of 3 fact tables). However, it reduces customer and date joins to one per channel.
- Must ensure grouping by sale_type is preserved; otherwise pivot would mix channels.
- The pivot_cte must output sale_type to allow main join filter.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy (combines date_cte_isolate, single_pass_aggregation, and union consolidation into a novel pipeline)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept original UNION CTE alongside specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting the CTE into year/channel-specific CTEs, ELIMINATE the original year_total CTE entirely.
2. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline runtime <100ms, CTE materialization overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: Our baseline is 8156ms, so safe to apply.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly columns customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Downstream joins need customer_id, sale_type, year totals; output needs customer attributes.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=1999 and d_year=2000 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 100 rows with same ordering.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: EXPLAIN shows each fact table scanned twice (once per year); total 6 scans.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: date_dim scanned 6 times; filter not shared across CTE references.
- UNION_CTE_SELF_JOIN_DECOMPOSITION: Generic CTE year_total is self-joined 6 times with different (sale_type, year) filters.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Use conditional aggregation across years within each channel, but we do it after unioning all channels.
- date_cte_isolate (Q6): Isolate date filter into CTE reused across all channel subqueries.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Label rows with sale_type and year, then aggregate; we adapt by unioning all channels first.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 2. date_cte_isolate (4.00x)

**Principle:** Dimension Isolation: extract small dimension lookups into CTEs so they materialize once and subsequent joins probe a tiny hash table instead of rescanning.

 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)

 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `customer_id`
  2. `customer_first_name`
  3. `customer_last_name`
  4. `customer_birth_country`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] year_total  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build per-customer, per-year totals for store, catalog, and web channels using the query's channel-specific profitability formula and label each row with its sale type.
│   ├── SCAN (customer, web_sales (join), date_dim (join), store_sales (join), catalog_sales (join))
│   ├── JOIN (c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk)
│   ├── JOIN (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   ├── UNION
│   └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_preferred_cust_flag, customer_birth_country, customer_login, customer_email_address, dyear, ...)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Self-join channel/year totals for 1999 and 2000 by customer, enforce positive 1999 baselines, compare growth ratios across channels, and keep customers where catalog growth beats both store and web.
    ├── SCAN (year_total AS t_s_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_s_secyear (join), year_total AS t_c_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_c_secyear (join), year_total AS t_w_firstyear (join), year_total AS t_w_secyear (join))
    ├── JOIN (t_s_secyear.customer_id = t_s_firstyear.customer_id)
    ├── JOIN (t_s_firstyear.customer_id = t_c_secyear.customer_id)
    ├── JOIN (+3 more)
    ├── FILTER (t_s_firstyear.sale_type = 's')
    ├── FILTER (t_c_firstyear.sale_type = 'c')
    ├── FILTER (+15 more)
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (t_s_secyear.customer_id ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_first_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_last_name ASC, t_s_secyear.customer_birth_country ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (customer_id, customer_first_name, customer_last_name, customer_birth_country)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
