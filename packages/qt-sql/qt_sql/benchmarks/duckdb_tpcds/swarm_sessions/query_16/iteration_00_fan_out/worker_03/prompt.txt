You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Measure distinct order count, shipping cost, and net profit for WV shipments (April-June 2002) from specific call-center counties, limited to orders shipped from multiple warehouses with no returns. JOIN semantics: INNER joins require matching rows in all 4 tables; EXISTS is a semi-join (stop at first match); NOT EXISTS is anti-join (exclude if any match). Aggregation traps: COUNT(DISTINCT) and SUMs are grouping-insensitive to duplicates. Filter dependencies: date range filter on d_date must join via d_date_sk; state filter on ca_address_sk join; county filter on cc_call_center_sk join; multi-warehouse check depends on cs_warehouse_sk inequality; no-returns check depends on cr_order_number.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Pre-aggregating returns may scan full table (66K rows) vs. anti-join with early termination
- Still has correlated EXISTS for multi-warehouse

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x):
   CAUSE: EXISTS subquery materialized into full CTE scan, destroying semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Never convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS used as filter into materialized CTE
2. regression_q25_date_cte_isolate (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered fact table before multi-way join, preventing optimizer reordering
   RULE: Avoid pre-joining fact with date CTE when query has complex multi-table joins
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs caused Cartesian explosion
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; each CTE must have WHERE clause

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly 3 columns: count(distinct cs_order_number), sum(cs_ext_ship_cost), sum(cs_net_profit)
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (cs_order_number, cs_ext_ship_cost, cs_net_profit, cs_warehouse_sk, plus join keys)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '2002-4-01', interval 60 DAY, state 'WV', county list exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same 1-row result with same ordering (ORDER BY count(distinct cs_order_number) ASC)
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Dimension filters not pushed into fact scan (EXPLAIN shows SEQ_SCAN catalog_sales without dimension filters)
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: catalog_sales scanned twice (main:115.4ms, EXISTS:1.4ms) in EXPLAIN

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- decorrelate: Apply pre-aggregation of catalog_returns into CTE for anti-join; ignore that EXISTS is already decorrelated
- composite_decorrelate_union: Apply shared dimension CTEs for date/addr/call; ignore the UNION aspect (we have single EXISTS)
- multi_intersect_exists_cte: Apply pre-materialized dimension CTEs; ignore INTERSECT conversion

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
  ca_state,
  cd_gender,

  cd_dep_employed_count,
  count(*) cnt2,
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  sum(cd_dep_employed_count),
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  cd_dep_college_count,
  count(*) cnt3,
  max(cd_dep_college_count),
  sum(cd_dep_college_count),
  max(cd_dep_college_count)

  c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk and

          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                d_year = 2001 and
                d_qoy < 4) and
   (exists (select *
            from web_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk and
                  ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and

    exists (select * 
            from catalog_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk and
                  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4))
 group by ca_state,
          cd_gender,
          cd_marital_status,

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `order count`
  2. `total shipping cost`
  3. `total net profit`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter catalog sales by ship date range, destination state, and call-center county; require same order number to appear with a different warehouse; exclude orders that appear in catalog_returns; then aggregate the requested order and profitability metrics.
    ├── SCAN (catalog_sales AS cs1 (join), date_dim (join), customer_address (join), call_center (join))
    ├── JOIN (cs1.cs_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cs1.cs_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN '2002-4-01' AND (CAST('2002-4-01' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY))
    ├── FILTER (ca_state = 'WV')
    ├── FILTER (+3 more)
    ├── SORT (COUNT(DISTINCT cs_order_number) ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (order count, total shipping cost, total net profit)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
