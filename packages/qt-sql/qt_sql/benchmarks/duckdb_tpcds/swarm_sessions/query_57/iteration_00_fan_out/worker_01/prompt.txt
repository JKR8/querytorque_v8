You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Detect 1999 monthly catalog-sales outliers by brand/category/call-center where monthly sales deviate >10% from that year's average monthly sales, using adjacent-month context. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all four tables. The AVG window is partition-sensitive: it must compute the average monthly sales per (category, brand, call_center, year) exactly as the original, including only months present in the filtered set (Dec-1998, 1999, Jan-2000). The self-join depends on consecutive months within the same (category, brand, call_center) series; missing months break adjacency. The final filter depends on d_year=1999 and avg_monthly_sales>0; rewriting must preserve these dependencies.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

    ORDER BY: sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales ASC, nsum ASC
    LIMIT: 100

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- If there are gaps in the month sequence for a (category, brand, cc_name) group, LAG/LEAD may not match the original rank-based adjacency. However, the date filter ensures at most three months (Dec-1998, 1999, Jan-2000) per group, so no gaps.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs when baseline was already optimized (<100ms) and the optimizer already pushed date predicates effectively.
   RULE: For this query (baseline 1467ms), date_cte_isolate is safe, but ensure the date CTE has a WHERE clause that actually reduces rows (already true: 427 rows).
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and materialized fact tables when the query has 3+ fact table joins, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (catalog_sales), so prefetch_fact_join is safe.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting, eliminate the original generic CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: The final SELECT * from v2 must output exactly i_brand, d_year, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales, psum, nsum in that order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: v1 must output i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales, rn (and any additional columns needed for self-join or filtering).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All date literals (1999, 1998, 2000, 12, 1) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The result set must match exactly, including ordering and limit.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The predicate d_year=1999 is applied in main query, not pushed into v1. v1 includes unnecessary rows for 1998 and 2000 that are filtered out later.
- SELF_JOIN_ELIMINATION: The v2 self-join on rank adjacency can be replaced with window functions (LAG/LEAD).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the self-join elimination pattern: replace the three-way self-join with LAG/LEAD window functions in v1. Ignore any decorrelation or UNION aspects — this query has no correlated subqueries.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. SELF_JOIN_TO_WINDOW (unknown)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
SELECT a.*, b.max_salary
      FROM employees a
      JOIN (
          SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
          FROM employees GROUP BY department
      ) b ON a.department = b.department;
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
