You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Detect 1999 monthly catalog-sales outliers by brand/category/call-center where monthly sales deviate >10% from that year's average monthly sales, using adjacent-month context. All joins are INNER (intersection), requiring matching rows in all four tables. The AVG window is partition-sensitive: it must compute the average monthly sales per (category, brand, call_center, year) exactly as the original, including only months present in the filtered set (Dec-1998, 1999, Jan-2000). The self-join depends on consecutive months within the same (category, brand, call_center) series; missing months break adjacency. The final filter depends on d_year=1999 and avg_monthly_sales>0; rewriting must preserve these dependencies.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
monthly_sales -> yearly_avg -> v1_combined -> v2 -> main_query
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  monthly_sales:
    FROM: item, catalog_sales, date_dim, call_center
    JOIN: cs_item_sk = i_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk, cc_call_center_sk = cs_call_center_sk
    WHERE: (d_year = 1999 OR (d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 12) OR (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1))
    GROUP BY: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy
    AGGREGATE: sum(cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 148K
    CONSUMERS: yearly_avg, v1_combined
  yearly_avg:
    FROM: monthly_sales
    GROUP BY: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year
    AGGREGATE: avg(sum_sales) AS avg_monthly_sales
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, avg_monthly_sales
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~50K (estimate)
    CONSUMERS: v1_combined
  v1_combined:
    FROM: monthly_sales
    JOIN: yearly_avg USING (i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year)
    WINDOW: rn: RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy)
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales, rn
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 148K
    CONSUMERS: v2
  v2 and main_query: same as original.

NODE_CONTRACTS:
monthly_sales:
    FROM: item, catalog_sales, date_dim, call_center
    JOIN: cs_item_sk = i_item_sk, cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk, cc_call_center_sk = cs_call_center_sk
    WHERE: (d_year = 1999 OR (d_year = 1998 AND d_moy = 12) OR (d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1))
    GROUP BY: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy
    AGGREGATE: sum(cs_sales_price) AS sum_sales
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 148K
    CONSUMERS: yearly_avg, v1_combined
  yearly_avg:
    FROM: monthly_sales
    GROUP BY: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year
    AGGREGATE: avg(sum_sales) AS avg_monthly_sales
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, avg_monthly_sales
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~50K (estimate)
    CONSUMERS: v1_combined
  v1_combined:
    FROM: monthly_sales
    JOIN: yearly_avg USING (i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year)
    WINDOW: rn: RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category, i_brand, cc_name ORDER BY d_year, d_moy)
    OUTPUT: i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales, rn
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 148K
    CONSUMERS: v2
  v2 and main_query: same as original.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The join between monthly_sales and yearly_avg may increase intermediate data size (148K join 50K). However, the original window also processes all rows.
- The RANK window remains; could be combined with LAG/LEAD for further optimization, but that's out of scope for this strategy.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Created filtered CTEs when baseline was already optimized (<100ms) and the optimizer already pushed date predicates effectively.
   RULE: For this query (baseline 1467ms), date_cte_isolate is safe, but ensure the date CTE has a WHERE clause that actually reduces rows (already true: 427 rows).
2. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtered and materialized fact tables when the query has 3+ fact table joins, preventing optimizer reordering.
   RULE: This query has only one fact table (catalog_sales), so prefetch_fact_join is safe.
3. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization.
   RULE: When splitting, eliminate the original generic CTE.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: The final SELECT * from v2 must output exactly i_brand, d_year, avg_monthly_sales, sum_sales, psum, nsum in that order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: v1 must output i_category, i_brand, cc_name, d_year, d_moy, sum_sales, avg_monthly_sales, rn (and any additional columns needed for self-join or filtering).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All date literals (1999, 1998, 2000, 12, 1) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The result set must match exactly, including ordering and limit.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: The predicate d_year=1999 is applied in main query, not pushed into v1. v1 includes unnecessary rows for 1998 and 2000 that are filtered out later.
- SELF_JOIN_ELIMINATION: The v2 self-join on rank adjacency can be replaced with window functions (LAG/LEAD).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply the deferred aggregation pattern: split the AVG window into a separate group-by and join. Ignore the self-join elimination — keep the original v2 self-join. Note that the window for AVG is replaced by a group-by and join, which may reduce window computation cost.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
