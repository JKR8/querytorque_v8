You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count unique customer-name/date combinations that appear in store sales during months 1184-1195 but do NOT appear in catalog sales OR web sales for same period. JOINs are INNER (must match), EXCEPT removes duplicates and performs set difference. No aggregation traps (only COUNT(*)). Filter dependencies: all three branches use identical date_dim filter (d_month_seq 1184-1195) and same customer join keys.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY may produce incorrect multiplicities if same customer/date appears multiple times in a fact table.
- COALESCE on different customer keys may incorrectly merge rows from different customers.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (combining single-pass aggregation with bitmap flags and early date filtering, but using LEFT JOIN instead of UNION ALL to avoid scanning fact tables multiple times).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXCEPT to materialized intermediate CTEs that lose short-circuiting.
2. or_to_union (0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range OR into UNION ALL, duplicating fact scans.
   RULE: Do NOT split OR conditions on same column (not applicable here).
3. dimension_cte_isolate (0.0076x on Q26):
   CAUSE: Cross-joined 3+ dimension CTEs causing Cartesian explosion.
   RULE: Never cross-join 3+ dimension CTEs; ensure each CTE has WHERE clause.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output COUNT(*) only.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must include c_last_name, c_first_name, d_date for downstream EXCEPT/NOT EXISTS.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_month_seq BETWEEN 1184 AND 1184+11.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same count.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: date_dim scanned 3x (0.2ms each), customer scanned 3x (~10ms each).
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Same date filter repeated across three branches.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply conditional aggregation; ignore scalar subquery pattern.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Apply bitmap flags via CASE; ignore time bucket partitioning.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `COUNT(*)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Build distinct customer/date sets for store, catalog, and web channels over the 12-month window, subtract catalog and web sets from store set via EXCEPT, and return the count.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, date_dim, customer, store_sales, catalog_sales)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
    ├── JOIN (web_sales.ws_bill_customer_sk = customer.c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1184 AND 1184 + 11)
    └── OUTPUT (COUNT(*))
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
