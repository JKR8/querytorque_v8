You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return six side-by-side quantity-bucket profiles of store sales, each with average list price, row count, and distinct list-price count under bucket-specific price/coupon/wholesale filters. The six subqueries are independent (no joins between them) and their results are cross-joined (Cartesian product) to produce one row. Aggregation uses AVG, COUNT, and COUNT(DISTINCT) on ss_list_price; COUNT only includes non-null values. Each row belongs to exactly one bucket due to disjoint ss_quantity ranges, and must also satisfy the bucket's OR condition on three columns. Any rewrite must preserve the exact bucket definitions and literal constants.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_sales CTE -> six subqueries scanning CTE -> cross-join
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  filtered_sales:
    FROM: store_sales
    WHERE: ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 30
    OUTPUT: ss_quantity, ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_wholesale_cost
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~8.4M
    CONSUMERS: B1_subquery, B2_subquery, ..., B6_subquery

    AGGREGATE: 
      B1_LP = AVG(ss_list_price),
      B1_CNT = COUNT(ss_list_price),

  final cross-join: Cross-join B1_subquery, B2_subquery, ..., B6_subquery.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- The CTE may be scanned six times, reading ~8.4M rows each time, total ~50.4M rows, which could be slower than original.
- DuckDB may inline the CTE (single reference) but here it's referenced six times, so it might materialize. Materialization could help if the CTE is much smaller than base table, but here it's the same as the union of original scans.
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: constraint_relaxation (testing if materializing a filtered CTE referenced multiple times can be beneficial despite the regression warning about unfiltered CTEs; here the CTE has a WHERE clause).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Or-to-Union on same-column OR (observed regression 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR into UNION ALL duplicated fact scans without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Do not split OR conditions on the same column; here OR is on different columns, but each bucket's OR is three different columns. Splitting per column could still duplicate rows (a row may satisfy multiple conditions) requiring deduplication.
2. Materialize CTE for EXISTS (observed regression 0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Not applicable; this query has no EXISTS subqueries.
3. Unfiltered dimension CTE (observed regression 0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: CTE without WHERE clause added overhead.
   RULE: Any CTE must have a WHERE clause (e.g., ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 30) to reduce rows.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly six columns per bucket (B1_LP, B1_CNT, B1_CNTD, ..., B6_LP, B6_CNT, B6_CNTD).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_wholesale_cost, and ss_quantity for downstream filtering and aggregation.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All numeric constants in filters (e.g., 131, 16798, 25) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The single output row must match the original exactly.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Six scans of store_sales present a clear opportunity for consolidation (evidence: each scan takes 300-1150ms, total 3734ms).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- materialize_cte (Q95): Apply the pattern of extracting a repeated subquery pattern into a CTE. Ignore the EXISTS logic — here we have simple scans.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. materialize_cte (1.37x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization: extract repeated subquery patterns into CTEs to avoid recomputation. When the same logical check appears multiple times, compute it once and reference the result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with ws_wh as
(select ws1.ws_order_number,ws1.ws_warehouse_sk wh1,ws2.ws_warehouse_sk wh2
 from web_sales ws1,web_sales ws2
 where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
   and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
 select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '1999-2-01' and 
           (cast('1999-2-01' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = 'NC'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_company_name = 'pri'
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select ws_order_number
                            from ws_wh)
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select wr_order_number
                            from web_returns,ws_wh
                            where wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)
order by count(distinct ws_order_number)
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[multi_warehouse_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
```
[returned_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ws_order_number) AS order_count, SUM(ws_ext_ship_cost) AS total_shipping FROM web_sales ws1 JOIN date_dim ON ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer_address ON ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk JOIN web_site ON ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk JOIN multi_warehouse_orders mwo ON ws1.ws_order_number = mwo.ws_order_number LEFT JOIN returned_orders ro ON ws1.ws_order_number = ro.wr_order_number WHERE d_date BETWEEN '2000-03-01' AND '2000-05-01' AND ca_state = 'IL' AND web_company_name = 'pri' AND ro.wr_order_number IS NULL
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Evaluate six independent bucket subqueries (quantity ranges 0-5 through 26-30) and cross-join their aggregate outputs into one comparison row.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales)
    ├── FILTER (ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 5)
    ├── FILTER ((ss_list_price BETWEEN 131 AND 131 + 10 OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 16798 AND 16798 + 1000 OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 25 AND 25 + 20))
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
