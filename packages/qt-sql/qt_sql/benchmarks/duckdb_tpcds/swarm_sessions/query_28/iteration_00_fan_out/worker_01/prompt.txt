You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Return six side-by-side quantity-bucket profiles of store sales, each with average list price, row count, and distinct list-price count under bucket-specific price/coupon/wholesale filters. The six subqueries are independent (no joins between them) and their results are cross-joined (Cartesian product) to produce one row. Aggregation uses AVG, COUNT, and COUNT(DISTINCT) on ss_list_price; COUNT only includes non-null values. Each row belongs to exactly one bucket due to disjoint ss_quantity ranges, and must also satisfy the bucket's OR condition on three columns. Any rewrite must preserve the exact bucket definitions and literal constants.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Complex CASE expressions may increase CPU overhead per row, but I/O reduction should dominate.
- COUNT(DISTINCT) with CASE may be more expensive than separate scans, but still one pass.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Or-to-Union on same-column OR (observed regression 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Splitting same-column OR into UNION ALL duplicated fact scans without selectivity benefit.
   RULE: Do not split OR conditions on the same column; here OR is on different columns, but each bucket's OR is three different columns. Splitting per column could still duplicate rows (a row may satisfy multiple conditions) requiring deduplication.
2. Materialize CTE for EXISTS (observed regression 0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to materialized CTE forced full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit.
   RULE: Not applicable; this query has no EXISTS subqueries.
3. Unfiltered dimension CTE (observed regression 0.85x on Q67):
   CAUSE: CTE without WHERE clause added overhead.
   RULE: Any CTE must have a WHERE clause (e.g., ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 30) to reduce rows.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output exactly six columns per bucket (B1_LP, B1_CNT, B1_CNTD, ..., B6_LP, B6_CNT, B6_CNTD).
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include ss_list_price, ss_coupon_amt, ss_wholesale_cost, and ss_quantity for downstream filtering and aggregation.
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: All numeric constants in filters (e.g., 131, 16798, 25) must be copied exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: The single output row must match the original exactly.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Six scans of store_sales present a clear opportunity for consolidation (evidence: each scan takes 300-1150ms, total 3734ms).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation (Q9): Apply the pattern of merging multiple scalar subqueries into one CTE with CASE inside aggregates. Ignore the dimension joins — this query has no joins.
- channel_bitmap_aggregation (Q88): Apply the consolidation of repeated fact scans into a single scan with conditional aggregation. Ignore the bitmap labeling — we use CASE directly.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Evaluate six independent bucket subqueries (quantity ranges 0-5 through 26-30) and cross-join their aggregate outputs into one comparison row.
    ├── SCAN (store_sales)
    ├── FILTER (ss_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 5)
    ├── FILTER ((ss_list_price BETWEEN 131 AND 131 + 10 OR ss_coupon_amt BETWEEN 16798 AND 16798 + 1000 OR ss_wholesale_cost BETWEEN 25 AND 25 + 20))
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
