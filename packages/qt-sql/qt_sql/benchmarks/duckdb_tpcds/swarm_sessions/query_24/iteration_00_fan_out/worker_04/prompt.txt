You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Business intent: Find customers in market 8 who returned purchases, live in different ZIP than store but matching store ZIP, were born outside their current country, and spent above 5% of average profit for specific item colors. JOIN semantics: All INNER joins (intersection) requiring matches across all 6 tables. Aggregation trap: HAVING subquery computes 0.05*average(netpaid) from ENTIRE CTE (all colors), not just filtered color. Filter dependencies: s_market_id=8, c_birth_country <> upper(ca_country), s_zip = ca_zip must stay together; color filter can move earlier.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Window function AVG(SUM()) OVER() may not be valid syntax - need to compute in two steps
- Must include 'other' colors in base_scan for correct threshold, then filter out
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
OVERRIDE_REASONING: N/A
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination (single scan with window-based threshold computation)

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. materialize_cte (0.14x on Q16):
   CAUSE: Converted EXISTS to materialized CTE, forcing full scan instead of semi-join short-circuit
   RULE: Do NOT convert EXISTS/NOT EXISTS filters to materialized CTEs in this query (none present)
2. union_cte_split (0.49x on Q74):
   CAUSE: Kept both original UNION and specialized CTEs, causing redundant materialization
   RULE: When splitting CTEs, ELIMINATE the original generic CTE entirely
3. prefetch_fact_join (0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated savings
   RULE: This query likely >100ms, but avoid excessive CTE chaining

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output c_last_name, c_first_name, s_store_name, paid for each color statement
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any new CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (c_last_name, c_first_name, s_store_name, i_color, netpaid, etc.)
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve 'beige', 'blue', 8, 0.05 exactly
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Return identical rows per color statement
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Color filter applied late in main query, not pushed into CTE
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: CTE scanned twice per statement, two statements scan same base tables
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: HAVING subquery references CTE, recomputes same value

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- single_pass_aggregation: Single scan computing multiple aggregates
- channel_bitmap_aggregation: Use window function to compute threshold in same pass
- deferred_window_aggregation: Compute threshold via window instead of separate CTE

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

### 3. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `s_store_name`
  4. `paid`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] ssales  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Build customer-store-item aggregates of ss_net_profit for transactions with matching returns under the market/ZIP/country constraints.
│   ├── SCAN (store_sales, store_returns (join), store (join), item (join), customer (join), customer_address (join))
│   ├── JOIN (ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number)

└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K  — Filter the intermediate set by target item color (template variant), aggregate paid profit per customer/store, and keep groups above 5% of the overall average netpaid.
    ├── SCAN (ssales)
    ├── FILTER (i_color = 'beige')
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)

    └── OUTPUT (c_last_name, c_first_name, s_store_name, paid)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
