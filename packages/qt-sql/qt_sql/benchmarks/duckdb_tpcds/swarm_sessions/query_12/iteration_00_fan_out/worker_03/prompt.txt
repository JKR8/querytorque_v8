You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Compute web sales revenue per item within a 30-day window starting 1998-04-06 for categories Books, Sports, and Men, then calculate each item's percentage contribution within its item class. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matching rows in all three tables. Aggregation uses SUM which is duplicate-insensitive; the window function uses SUM of SUMs over partition by i_class. The i_category filter must be applied before or during the item join, and the date filter must be applied before or during the date_dim join.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Computing class_totals requires rescanning the same joined tables (web_sales, date_dim, item) which could double the cost. However, the join result is small (22K rows) and aggregation cheap.
- Must ensure class_totals includes only i_class and class_revenue, and join on i_class.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. date_cte_isolate (observed regression 0.49x on Q31):
   CAUSE: Baseline <100ms, CTE overhead exceeded savings.
   RULE: This query baseline is 637ms (>100ms), so CTE overhead may be acceptable.
2. or_to_union (observed regression 0.59x on Q90):
   CAUSE: Split same-column time range, doubled fact scans.
   RULE: Never split same-column ORs; engine handles natively.
3. prefetch_fact_join (observed regression 0.50x on Q25):
   CAUSE: Baseline <50ms, CTE overhead dominated.
   RULE: This query baseline 637ms, acceptable.

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price, itemrevenue, revenueratio in same order.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (join keys, grouping columns, aggregates).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve date '1998-04-06', interval 30 DAY, categories 'Books','Sports','Men'.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Must return same rows and ordering.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: EXPLAIN shows filters pushed into scans, but dimension tables are scanned fully before joins (item 102K rows, date_dim 73K rows). Isolating filtered dimensions into CTEs could reduce hash table sizes.
- REDUNDANT_SCAN_ELIMINATION: Not active (single scan per table).

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- deferred_window_aggregation: apply the principle of computing window function after joins; here we compute class totals separately and join; ignore that the example uses FULL OUTER JOIN and cumulative sum.
- single_pass_aggregation: apply consolidation of repeated scans; here we avoid computing window function by separate aggregation; ignore that the example uses CASE WHEN aggregation.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**

from web_sales

  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *

           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y

```

### 2. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `i_item_id`
  2. `i_item_desc`
  3. `i_category`
  4. `i_class`
  5. `i_current_price`
  6. `itemrevenue`
  7. `revenueratio`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join web sales to item and date, filter to the date window and target categories, aggregate revenue per item attributes, and compute class-level revenue share using a window partition on i_class.
    ├── SCAN (web_sales, item (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (ws_item_sk = i_item_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk)
    ├── FILTER (i_category IN ('Books', 'Sports', 'Men'))
    ├── FILTER (d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) AND (CAST('1998-04-06' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_item_id ASC, i_item_desc ASC, revenueratio ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_category, i_class, i_current_price, itemrevenue, revenueratio)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
