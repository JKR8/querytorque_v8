You are a SQL rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

DuckDB specifics: columnar storage (SELECT only needed columns). CTEs referenced once are typically inlined; CTEs referenced multiple times may be materialized. FILTER clause is native (`COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE cond)`). Predicate pushdown stops at UNION ALL boundaries and multi-level CTE references.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Count March 2002 store sales by customer state for items priced >120% of their category average, outputting states with ≥10 qualifying rows. All joins are INNER (intersection) requiring matches across all 5 tables. The COUNT(*) aggregate is duplicate-safe but the correlated AVG per category must preserve exact category boundaries. The HAVING filter depends on the count after all joins and filters.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Must preserve the original date subquery structure (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq).
- JOIN condition i.i_category = ia.i_category must handle NULL categories correctly (original uses IS NOT DISTINCT FROM).

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. regression_q1_decorrelate (0.71x):
   CAUSE: Pre-aggregating GROUP BY into CTEs lost optimizer's incremental computation with filter pushdown.
   RULE: When decorrelating item average, keep the AVG computation as a simple CTE without extra GROUP BY columns.
2. regression_q25_date_cte_isolate (0.5x):
   CAUSE: Pre-filtering fact table before multi-way join prevented optimizer reordering.
   RULE: Avoid forcing join order when query has multiple fact tables (not applicable here - only store_sales).

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must output state and cnt columns exactly.
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Any CTE must include all columns referenced downstream (ca_state, ca_address_sk, i_category, etc.).
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve 2002, 3, 1.2, 10, 100 exactly.
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Result rows, columns, and ordering must match original.
- CORRELATED_SUBQUERY_PARALYSIS: LEFT_DELIM_JOIN in EXPLAIN shows item average subquery still correlated.
- CROSS_CTE_PREDICATE_BLINDNESS: Date filter applied via subquery could be pushed earlier via CTE.

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

- decorrelate: Apply the pattern of converting correlated AVG subquery to CTE+JOIN. Ignore the s_state filter pushdown (not present here).
- composite_decorrelate_union: Ignore the UNION/EXISTS aspects; focus on extracting shared dimension filters.

## Reference Examples

Pattern reference only — do not copy table/column names or literals.

### 1. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 2. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
  ca_state,
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_dep_count,
  count(*) cnt1,
  max(cd_dep_count),
  sum(cd_dep_count),
  max(cd_dep_count),
  cd_dep_employed_count,
  count(*) cnt2,
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  sum(cd_dep_employed_count),
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  cd_dep_college_count,
  count(*) cnt3,
  max(cd_dep_college_count),
  sum(cd_dep_college_count),
  max(cd_dep_college_count)
 from
  customer c,customer_address ca,customer_demographics
 where
  c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk and
  cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk and 
  exists (select *
          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                d_year = 2001 and
                d_qoy < 4) and
   (exists (select *
            from web_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk and
                  ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4) or 
    exists (select * 
            from catalog_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk and
                  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4))
 group by ca_state,
          cd_gender,
          cd_marital_status,
          cd_dep_count,
          cd_dep_employed_count,
          cd_dep_college_count
 order by ca_state,
          cd_gender,
          cd_marital_status,
          cd_dep_count,
          cd_dep_employed_count,
          cd_dep_college_count
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4
```
[store_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[web_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_bill_customer_sk FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[catalog_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cs_ship_customer_sk FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[web_or_catalog_customers]:
```sql
SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk FROM web_customers UNION SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk AS customer_sk FROM catalog_customers
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), cd_dep_employed_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt2, MAX(cd_dep_employed_count), SUM(cd_dep_employed_count), MAX(cd_dep_employed_count), cd_dep_college_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt3, MAX(cd_dep_college_count), SUM(cd_dep_college_count), MAX(cd_dep_college_count) FROM customer AS c JOIN customer_address AS ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk JOIN store_customers AS sc ON c.c_customer_sk = sc.ss_customer_sk JOIN web_or_catalog_customers AS wcc ON c.c_customer_sk = wcc.customer_sk GROUP BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count ORDER BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count LIMIT 100
```

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 6 in stream 0 using template query6.tpl
select a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
 from customer_address a
     ,customer c
     ,store_sales s
     ,date_dim d
     ,item i
 where       a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
 	and c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
 	and s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
 	and s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
 	and d.d_month_seq = 
 	     (select distinct (d_month_seq)
 	      from date_dim
               where d_year = 2002
 	        and d_moy = 3 )
 	and i.i_current_price > 1.2 * 
             (select avg(j.i_current_price) 
 	     from item j 
 	     where j.i_category = i.i_category)
 group by a.ca_state
 having count(*) >= 10
 order by cnt, a.ca_state
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 6 in stream 0 using template query6.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `state`
  2. `cnt`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K  — Join customer address, customer, store sales, date, and item; pin to the target month sequence for March 2002; apply a correlated category-average price test; group by state and filter with HAVING.
    ├── SCAN (customer_address AS a (join), customer AS c (join), store_sales AS s (join), date_dim AS d (join), item AS i (join), date_dim (correlated subquery), item AS j (correlated subquery))
    ├── JOIN (a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk)
    ├── JOIN (c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+2 more)
    ├── FILTER (d.d_month_seq op (d_month_seq))
    ├── FILTER (i.i_current_price > AVG(j.i_current_price) (per i_category))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (cnt ASC, a.ca_state ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (state, cnt)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
