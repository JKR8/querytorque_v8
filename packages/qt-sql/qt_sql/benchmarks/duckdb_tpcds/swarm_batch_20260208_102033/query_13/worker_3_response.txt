**Changes**: Restructured the complex OR conditions into separate CTEs for each scenario, pre-joining filtered date dimension with fact table early, then using UNION ALL to combine scenario results, and finally intersecting via EXISTS to preserve semantics.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x from reducing join fanout and early filtering of fact data through staged CTE pipeline.
