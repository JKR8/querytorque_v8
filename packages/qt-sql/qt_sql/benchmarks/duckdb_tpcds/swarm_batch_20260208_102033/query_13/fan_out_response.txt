WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into dimension CTEs first, then joining with the fact table. Reduce join costs by filtering early and isolating date dimension.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table. Isolate shared dimension patterns to reduce redundant filtering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Restructure joins using multiple CTE stages—pre-join filtered dimensions with fact data early. Decorate complex conditions by materializing distinct subsets.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches for better indexing. Consolidate multiple filtering passes into single aggregates and rethink set operations.
