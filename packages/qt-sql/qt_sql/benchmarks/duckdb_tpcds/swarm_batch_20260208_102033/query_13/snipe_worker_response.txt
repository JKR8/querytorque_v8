**Changes**: 
1. Created early-filtering CTEs for date_dim, customer_address, and combined household_demographics/customer_demographics with their respective OR conditions.
2. Pushed the ss_sales_price range checks into the final WHERE clause to avoid materializing unnecessary combinations.
3. Used explicit JOIN syntax with clean separation of dimension filters before joining to the fact table.

**Expected speedup**: 2.5x - 3.0x via dimension pre-filtering and staged join reduction, allowing each dimension table to be filtered independently before joining with the large store_sales fact table.
