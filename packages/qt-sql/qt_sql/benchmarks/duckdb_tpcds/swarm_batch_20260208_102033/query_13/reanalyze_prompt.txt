You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_early_filter
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced column "cd_marital_status" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "d_date_sk", "ca_address_sk", "cd_demo_sk", "s_market_desc", "s_market_id"

LINE 37:         cd_marital_status = 'D' 
                 ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into dimension CTEs first, then joining with the fact table. Reduce join costs by filtering early and isolating date dimension.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.21x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table. Isolate shared dimension patterns to reduce redundant filtering.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT 
        cd_demo_sk,

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.85x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins using multiple CTE stages—pre-join filtered dimensions with fact data early. Decorate complex conditions by materializing distinct subsets.

WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.83x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches for better indexing. Consolidate multiple filtering passes into single aggregates and rethink set operations.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
