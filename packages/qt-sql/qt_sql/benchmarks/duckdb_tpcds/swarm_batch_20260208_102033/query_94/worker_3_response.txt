Changes: Restructured query using multiple CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) before joining with web_sales, reducing the fact table scan early while preserving EXISTS/NOT EXISTS semantics.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from reduced fact table processing and early dimension filtering.
