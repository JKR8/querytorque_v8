Changes: Decorrelated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries into independent CTEs with DISTINCT keys and converted INTERSECT-like patterns to IN/NOT IN joins. Pre-filtered dimension tables into CTEs to reduce join cardinality early.

Expected speedup: ~2x-3x by eliminating correlated subquery execution per row and enabling hash join optimizations.
