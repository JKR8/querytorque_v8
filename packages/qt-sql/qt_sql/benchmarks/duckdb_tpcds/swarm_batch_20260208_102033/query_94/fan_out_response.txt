WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply simple, safe optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing predicates into joins, and materializing reusable subquery results.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and reuse.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure the query using multiple CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with facts, then consolidate aggregations into a single pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform correlated subqueries into independent CTEs with distinct keys, convert INTERSECT patterns to EXISTS, and decorrelate multiple subqueries simultaneously.
