Changes: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer join-order flexibility. No CTE creation to avoid materialization overhead on this already-fast query structure.

Expected speedup: ~1.1-1.3x (conservative estimate due to explicit join syntax enabling better optimization paths)
```

**Explanation:** While the benchmark suggests trying different approaches, this query is already quite optimal. The DAG shows it processes only ~1k rows to produce 100 rows output, making it a fast query already. The most effective transformation for this structure is converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax, which gives DuckDB's optimizer more freedom to reorder joins without changing semantics. Adding CTEs would introduce materialization overhead likely to outweigh any benefits for such a small dataset. The explicit joins follow the `EXPLICIT_JOINS` constraint and maintain exact semantic equivalence while potentially enabling better optimization.
