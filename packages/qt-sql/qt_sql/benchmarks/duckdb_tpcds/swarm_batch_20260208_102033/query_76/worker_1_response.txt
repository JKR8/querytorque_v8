Changes: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOINs and isolated each channel's fact table scan into separate CTEs with dimension tables joined early. This allows DuckDB to apply join reordering and push filters into each branch independently while maintaining the same UNION ALL structure.

Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x through better join order optimization and early filtering of fact tables.
