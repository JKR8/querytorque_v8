**Changes**: Isolated each date_dim alias into separate CTEs with their respective filters, pre-filtered store and item dimensions into CTEs, then joined pre-filtered fact CTEs (store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales) with dimension CTEs using explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: ~1.8-2.2x due to early reduction of large fact tables via indexed date joins and creation of small, reusable dimension hash tables.
