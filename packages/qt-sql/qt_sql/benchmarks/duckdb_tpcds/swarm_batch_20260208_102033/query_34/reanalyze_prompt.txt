You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply predicate pushdown and early filtering to reduce join sizes, using materialized CTEs for safe, incremental improvements.

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_prefilter
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
