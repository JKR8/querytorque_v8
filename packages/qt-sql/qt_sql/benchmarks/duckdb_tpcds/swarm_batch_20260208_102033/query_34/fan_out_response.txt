WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply predicate pushdown and early filtering to reduce join sizes, using materialized CTEs for safe, incremental improvements.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_prefilter
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact table, isolating date ranges and dimension constraints early.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in CTEs, then aggregate in a single pass, optimizing for reduced intermediate data movement.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_or_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, restructure complex filtering patterns, and eliminate implicit correlations for novel execution paths.
