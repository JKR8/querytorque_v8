FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All workers fell short because they only applied incremental CTE-based restructurings without addressing the core bottleneck: the massive catalog_sales table scan and subsequent large join fanout. DuckDB's optimizer already pushes filters automatically, so isolated CTEs for dimension filtering (date_dim, warehouse, etc.) provided minimal gains (0.99x-1.13x). The real issue is the expensive computation of cs_ship_date_sk - cs_sold_date_sk for every row before aggregation, coupled with joining all dimension tables before grouping. Worker 3's precomputation of days_diff (1.11x) showed promise but still joined dimensions early, missing the opportunity to reduce join cardinality through early aggregation on surrogate keys.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Surrogate-key early aggregation**: Group by integer surrogate keys (cs_warehouse_sk, cs_ship_mode_sk, cs_call_center_sk) first, then join to dimension tables only for the final projection. This dramatically reduces the data volume during expensive string operations and multi-table joins.
2. **Vectorized date-difference computation**: Precompute the ship-sold day difference once in a dedicated CTE using integer arithmetic, avoiding repeated subtraction in each CASE expression.
3. **Dimension table pruning**: Since only 100 rows are needed after ORDER BY, we could use approximate grouping or limit pushdown techniques, but DuckDB's optimizations may already handle this.
4. **Parallelized aggregation**: While DuckDB automatically parallelizes, structuring the query to maximize independent aggregation chunks (e.g., by warehouse ranges) could help.

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Precompute date differences and aggregate by surrogate keys early to minimize data movement, then join dimension tables only for the final 100-row projection. This reduces the join cardinality to the number of distinct key combinations (likely far smaller than the fact table rows) and defers expensive string operations (SUBSTRING) until after aggregation and ordering.

1. Filter date_dim to relevant months in a CTE.
2. Join with catalog_sales to get relevant rows and compute days_diff in a second CTE.
3. Aggregate by the three integer surrogate keys, computing all bucket sums in a single pass.
4. Join the aggregated results with dimension tables (warehouse, ship_mode, call_center) to get descriptive columns.
5. Apply SUBSTRING, ORDER BY, and LIMIT 100 on the final small result set.

EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, early_filter
HINT: Push aggregation before dimension joins by grouping on surrogate keys (cs_warehouse_sk, cs_ship_mode_sk, cs_call_center_sk) and compute bucket sums using precalculated days_diff; only then join to dimension tables for string columns and final presentation.
