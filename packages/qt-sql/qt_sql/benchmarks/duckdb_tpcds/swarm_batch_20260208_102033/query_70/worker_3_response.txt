**Changes**: Created a chained CTE pipeline: first pre-filter date_dim, then pre-join with store to create a compact fact-dimension dataset. Computed state rankings and top states in separate CTEs using the same base data, then performed a single-pass ROLLUP aggregation on filtered data before window calculations.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3× through reduced data movement, elimination of redundant table scans, and allowing the optimizer to push aggregations through the simplified join structure.
