**Changes:**
1. Isolated date filtering into a single CTE (`filtered_dates`) to avoid redundant scans of `date_dim`.
2. Deferred window aggregation until after the join by computing daily sums first, then applying cumulative sums on the joined dataset.
3. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.5-2x from reduced redundant work and better predicate pushdown.
