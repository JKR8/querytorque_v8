You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering on dimension tables (date_dim, item) before joining with the large inventory fact table to reduce intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN (
        CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE) - INTERVAL '30' DAY
    ) AND (
        CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY
    )
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
)
SELECT
    w_warehouse_name,
    i_item_id,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN (
                CAST(d_date AS DATE) < CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE)
            )
            THEN inv_quantity_on_hand

-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reuse filtered dimensions across the query.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN (
        CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE) - INTERVAL '30' DAY
    ) AND (
        CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY
    )
),
aggregated AS (
    SELECT
        w.w_warehouse_name,
        i.i_item_id,
        SUM(CASE WHEN d.d_date < CAST('2002-02-27' AS DATE)

)
SELECT *
FROM aggregated x

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter multiple dimension tables into CTEs, then pre-join them with the fact table in a second CTE before final aggregation to minimize large table scans.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 0.99 AND 1.49
),

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
