WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables (date_dim, item) before joining with the large inventory fact table to reduce intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reuse filtered dimensions across the query.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter multiple dimension tables into CTEs, then pre-join them with the fact table in a second CTE before final aggregation to minimize large table scans.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural transformations like converting conditional logic to UNION ALL branches or decorrelating complex subqueries to enable more efficient join plans.
