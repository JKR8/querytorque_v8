WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply aggressive predicate pushdown into CTEs, pre-filter dimension tables first, and materialize the repeated item subquery into a shared CTE to avoid redundant computation across all three sales channels.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_isolation_multi_channel
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Pre-filter and isolate each dimension table (date, item, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining with the three sales fact tables, enabling reuse of filtered dimensions across all sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_consolidation
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in dedicated CTEs, then consolidate the three sales streams into a single aggregation pass. Restructure to scan each fact table only once with all necessary filters applied early.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform_decorrelate
EXAMPLES: decorrelate, or_to_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform the repeated IN subquery using decorrelation techniques, restructure with UNION branches for different conditions, and explore alternative subquery formulations to improve join planning and parallelization.
