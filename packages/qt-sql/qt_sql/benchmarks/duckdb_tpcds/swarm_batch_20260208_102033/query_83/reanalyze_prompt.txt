## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_reduction
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push date filters into CTEs, pre-filter dimension tables before joining, and materialize the repeated date subquery to avoid redundant computation.

```sql
WITH week_seq AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT d_week_seq
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date IN ('2001-06-06', '2001-09-02', '2001-11-11')
),

  SELECT d_date_sk, d_date
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_week_seq IN (SELECT d_week_seq FROM week_seq)
),
sr_items AS (
  SELECT
    i_item_id AS item_id,

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.07x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate shared dimension filters (date, item) into reusable CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and reducing dimension table scans across all three channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_week_seq IN (
    SELECT d_week_seq
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date IN ('2001-06-06', '2001-09-02', '2001-11-11')

  GROUP BY i_item_id
),

### Worker 3: aggressive_join_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.22x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins aggressively: pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with facts in CTEs, isolate multiple dimension filters early, and decorrelate the date subquery by pre-materializing week sequences.

```sql
WITH filtered_weeks AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT d_week_seq
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date IN ('2001-06-06', '2001-09-02', '2001-11-11')

  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim

  SELECT
    i_item_id AS item_id,
    SUM(sr_return_quantity) AS sr_item_qty

```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.19x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure using advanced patterns: convert date IN conditions to UNION ALL branches, rewrite subqueries as EXISTS clauses, and consider splitting the three channel CTEs into a unified structure with specialized filtering.

```sql
WITH date_filter AS (
  SELECT 
    d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim 
  WHERE d_week_seq IN (
    SELECT d_week_seq 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_date IN ('2001-06-06', '2001-09-02', '2001-11-11')
  )

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
