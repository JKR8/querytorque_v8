WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations: push date filters into CTEs, pre-filter dimension tables before joining, and materialize the repeated date subquery to avoid redundant computation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate shared dimension filters (date, item) into reusable CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and reducing dimension table scans across all three channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_join_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, decorrelate
HINT: Restructure joins aggressively: pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with facts in CTEs, isolate multiple dimension filters early, and decorrelate the date subquery by pre-materializing week sequences.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform query structure using advanced patterns: convert date IN conditions to UNION ALL branches, rewrite subqueries as EXISTS clauses, and consider splitting the three channel CTEs into a unified structure with specialized filtering.
