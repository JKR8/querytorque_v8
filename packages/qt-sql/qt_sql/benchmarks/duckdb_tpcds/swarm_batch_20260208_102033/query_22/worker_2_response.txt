  AVG(inv_quantity_on_hand) AS qoh
FROM filtered_inventory

Changes: Isolated date-dimension filtering into a CTE (`filtered_dates`), then joined it with the fact table in a second CTE (`filtered_inventory`) before joining with the item dimension. This creates small hash tables for the filtered dimension and early fact-table reduction.

Expected speedup: 1.5–2x from reduced join cardinality and better hash‑join probing.
