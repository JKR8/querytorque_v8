FAILURE_ANALYSIS:
All workers essentially applied the same optimization: isolating date_dim filtering into a CTE. While this reduces the dimension table early, it doesn't address the core bottleneck. The real issue is that inventory is the massive fact table, and the query must:
1. Scan/join the entire date-filtered inventory rows (still large)
2. Compute ROLLUP aggregation across 4 hierarchical item dimensions, requiring multiple passes over the data
3. Sort the entire aggregated result before limiting to 100 rows

The attempts only reshuffled CTE structures without changing the fundamental execution pattern. DuckDB's optimizer already pushes down date_dim filters, so CTE isolation provided minimal benefit. The ROLLUP operation remains expensive because it computes 2^n grouping sets (16 combinations) requiring multiple aggregation passes or a single pass with heavy memory usage.

UNEXPLORED_OPPORTUNITIES:
1. **Aggregate pushdown before join**: Compute partial aggregates on inventory before joining with item dimensions
2. **Rollup decomposition**: Split ROLLUP into multiple queries with early LIMIT pushdown
3. **Sampling/approximation**: Use statistical sampling for the average calculation
4. **Materialized view pattern**: Pre-aggregate at coarser granularity
5. **Parallel UNION ALL**: Compute different grouping levels in parallel and merge
6. **Window function avoidance**: Replace ROLLUP with multiple GROUP BY sets using UNION ALL

REFINED_STRATEGY:
Implement a two-phase aggregation that:
1. First computes base aggregates on inventory+date only (smaller join)
2. Then joins with item for dimension expansion
3. Uses UNION ALL of explicit grouping sets with early LIMIT pruning

Instead of computing all ROLLUP levels at once, compute them sequentially with early stopping: get the top 100 at the most detailed level first, then compute higher-level aggregates only if needed. Use COUNT() and SUM() aggregates that can be rolled up correctly from pre-aggregated results.

EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, union_cte_split, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Pre-aggregate inventory quantities by inv_item_sk and date range first, then join once with item. Compute different ROLLUP levels via UNION ALL of explicit grouping sets, applying LIMIT to each branch. Use approximate aggregates if precise average isn't critical.
