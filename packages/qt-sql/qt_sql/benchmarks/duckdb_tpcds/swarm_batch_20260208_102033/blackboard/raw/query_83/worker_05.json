  "what_worked": "Applied decorrelate, date_cte_isolate: ** Extracted the repeated date-filtering subquery into a shared CTE (`filtered_dates`) and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This eliminates redundant computation of the same date logic three times and gives the optimizer better join ordering freedom.\n\n**Expected speedup:** ~1.8-2.5x due to avoiding repeated date subquery execution and improved join planning.",
