Replaced the 3-way self-join (v2) with LAG/LEAD window functions to compute psum and nsum directly.\n3. Combined aggregation and window operations into a single CTE, eliminating the intermediate v1 CTE.\n\n**Expected speedup:** 2.5-3.5x due to eliminating self-joins and enabling partition-pruning via UNION ALL.",
