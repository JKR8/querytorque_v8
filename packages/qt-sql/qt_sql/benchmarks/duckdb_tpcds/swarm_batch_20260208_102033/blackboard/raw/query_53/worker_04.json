Worker 4's UNION ALL approach (0.68x) failed catastrophically because it doubled the fact table joins and eliminated join-order flexibility. The modest gains (1.06-1.18x) came from minor syntactic restructuring without addressing the real bottlenecks: (1) The window function `avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manufact_id",
