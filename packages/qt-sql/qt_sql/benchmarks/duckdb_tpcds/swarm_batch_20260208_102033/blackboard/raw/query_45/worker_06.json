  "what_worked": "Applied prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, or_to_union: Created three CTEs to isolate date filtering, customer filtering by ZIP codes, and item filtering by SK values. Used EXISTS semi-joins to push both OR conditions into a single scan of web_sales, avoiding expensive OR evaluation on large intermediate results. Aggregated sales after filtering to minimize data volume before joining to customer_address for final ZIP/city lookup.",
  "why_it_worked": "Pre-joining filtered dimensions with fact table before aggregation reduces join input; Consolidating repeated scans into CASE aggregates reduces I/O from N scans to 1; Converting OR to UNION ALL lets optimizer choose independent index paths per branch",
