Changes: Transformed the self-join on `all_sales` into a single-pass aggregation that computes both 1998 and 1999 metrics in conditional sums. This eliminates the expensive self-join and pushes year filters down into the UNION branches. Also changed UNION to UNION ALL for efficiency since duplicates are eliminated by later aggregation.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from eliminating the self-join and enabling early filtering.
