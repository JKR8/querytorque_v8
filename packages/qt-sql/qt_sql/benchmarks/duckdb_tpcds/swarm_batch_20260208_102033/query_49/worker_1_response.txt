**Changes**: Created a CTE for filtered date_dim to push the year/month filter early, converted implicit joins to explicit JOINs, restructured into parallel CTEs for each channel with early filtering, and used UNION ALL instead of UNION (since channels are mutually exclusive).

**Expected speedup**: 1.3-1.8x from reduced date_dim scanning and better join planning.
