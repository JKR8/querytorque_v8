WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by filtering dimension tables first, pushing filters into subqueries, and materializing repeated computations via CTEs.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate shared dimension filters (especially date_dim) into reusable CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce redundant joins across all three channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimension tables with fact tables in CTEs, then restructure window computations to run after union or in a single pass to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, explore alternative set-operation patterns, and consolidate multiple channel subqueries into a single aggregation with conditional logic.
