**Changes:** Isolated dimension table filters into separate CTEs (`filtered_items`, `filtered_dates`) to push filters earlier and reduce join cardinality before the main aggregation. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup:** 1.3–1.7x from reduced intermediate row counts and improved join planning.
