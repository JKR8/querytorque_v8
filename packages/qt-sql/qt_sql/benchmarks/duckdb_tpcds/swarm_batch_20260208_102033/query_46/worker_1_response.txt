**Changes:** 
- Pushed dimension table filters (`date_dim`, `store`, `household_demographics`) into separate CTEs to reduce the `store_sales` join volume early.
- Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
- Kept the same grouping and output structure while maintaining semantic equivalence.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.5–2x from reduced fact table scanning and earlier filter application.
