You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_dimension_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe dimension filtering first to reduce join volume, push filters into subqueries, and materialize repetitive patterns for clarity and potential reuse.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow IN (6, 0)
      AND d_year IN (1999, 1999 + 1, 1999 + 2)
), filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_city IN ('Five Points', 'Centerville', 'Oak Grove', 'Fairview', 'Liberty')
), filtered_hd AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_dep_count = 6 OR hd_vehicle_count = 0
), sales_agg AS (
    SELECT
        ss.ss_ticket_number,
        ss.ss_customer_sk,
        ca.ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss.ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate all filtered dimension tables (date, store, household_demographics, customer_address) into separate CTEs before joining with fact table to enable parallel filtering and predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow IN (6, 0)
      AND d_year IN (1999, 2000, 2001)

), aggregated_sales AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        customer_address.ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions in a coordinated pipeline, then join with fact table in a single optimized pass to minimize intermediate result sizes.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow IN (6, 0)
      AND d_year IN (1999, 1999 + 1, 1999 + 2)

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, decorrelate, intersect_to_exists

```sql
WITH filtered_hd AS (
  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE hd_dep_count = 6 OR hd_vehicle_count = 0
),
filtered_date AS (

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
