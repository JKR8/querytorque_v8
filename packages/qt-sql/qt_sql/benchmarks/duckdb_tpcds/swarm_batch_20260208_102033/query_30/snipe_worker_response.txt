Changes: Decorrelated the subquery by computing state averages in a separate CTE, then joining on state for comparison. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer planning.

Expected speedup: 2.0x+ by eliminating correlated subquery execution per row and enabling better join order optimization.
