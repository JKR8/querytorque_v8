You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filtering
- **Status**: fail (1.93x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables before joins, and materialize repeated patterns to avoid redundant computation.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_address AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_state
  FROM customer_address
  WHERE ca_state = 'IN'
),
customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca.ca_state AS ctr_state,
    SUM(wr_return_amt) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM web_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON wr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_customer_address ca ON wr_returning_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2002
  GROUP BY
    wr_returning_customer_sk,
    ca.ca_state
),

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.17x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs before fact joins, focusing on date and address dimension isolation to reduce join cardinality.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_addresses AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_state

    FROM web_returns
    JOIN filtered_dates ON wr_returned_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk

```

### Worker 3: aggressive_correlated_prefetch
- **Status**: fail (1.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Eliminate correlated subquery via decorrelation, pre-join filtered dimensions with facts in CTEs, and prefetch multiple dimension filters before main aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_address AS (
  SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_state

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.15x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Apply unconventional structural transformations - convert subquery patterns to EXISTS/UNION forms, and explore composite decorrelation for complex patterns.

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    wr_returning_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    ca_state AS ctr_state,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
