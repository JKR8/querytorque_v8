**Changes**: Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing state averages in a separate CTE and converting the correlated comparison to a regular join. This allows DuckDB to compute thresholds once per state rather than repeatedly for each row.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0-2.5x by eliminating the correlated subquery execution overhead and enabling better join optimization.
