Changes: Isolated `date_dim` and `customer_address` filters into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables in EXISTS subqueries and main query. This creates small hash tables for dimension lookups that are reused across all fact table joins. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and better optimization.

Expected speedup: ~1.5-2x from reducing dimension table rescans and enabling better hash join planning across all fact table probes.
