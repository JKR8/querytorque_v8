  "failure_analysis": "All attempts essentially implemented the same optimization: pre-filtering dimension tables into CTEs before joining with the fact table. This approach failed because:\n1. **DuckDB's optimizer already performs predicate pushdown automatically** - The CTEs don't fundamentally change the execution plan\n2. **No reduction in fact table scanning** - All attempts still scan the entire `store_sales` table before applying filters\n3. **Missing physical optimization angles** - No attempt addressed join algorithms, data skipping, or materialization strategies\n4. **Inefficient join ordering** - All use the same join pattern (store_sales \u2192 date \u2192 item) without considering cardinality\n5. **CTE overhead** - Additional materialization may introduce overhead without benefit when DuckDB can inline CTEs",
  "unexplored": "1. **Early fact table filtering** - Use dimension keys to filter fact table before full scan via derived tables or semi-joins\n2. **Join algorithm hints** - Explicitly specify hash joins or bloom filters\n3. **Data skipping via partition pruning** - Leverage DuckDB's ability to skip data based on known constraints\n4. **Materialized subquery** - Pre-aggregate fact table at grain of item before joining with dimensions\n5. **Columnar optimization** - Select only needed columns early to reduce I/O\n6. **Parallel scan optimization** - Use UNNEST or other patterns to encourage parallel execution",
  "refined_strategy": "Combine fact-table-first filtering with column pruning and explicit join ordering:\n1. Start with a pre-filtered fact table using EXISTS clauses with dimension keys\n2. Select only required columns from all tables upfront to minimize I/O\n3. Use explicit join ordering based on estimated selectivity (date_dim first due to high selectivity, then item, then aggregation)\n4. Apply LIMIT pushdown thinking by ordering early if possible\n5. Use derived tables instead of CTEs for better optimization transparency",
