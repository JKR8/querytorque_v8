```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_moy = 12
    AND d_year = 2000
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
  FROM item
  WHERE i_manager_id = 100
)
SELECT
  i_brand_id AS brand_id,
  i_brand AS brand,
  SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS ext_price
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_dates ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items ON store_sales.ss_item_sk = filtered_items.i_item_sk
GROUP BY
  i_brand,
  i_brand_id
ORDER BY
  ext_price DESC,
  i_brand_id
LIMIT 100
```

Changes: Isolated date and item filters into separate CTEs to enable early reduction and create explicit join points, converting implicit cross join to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
Expected speedup: 1.2-1.5x via reduced intermediate result sizes before the main aggregation.
