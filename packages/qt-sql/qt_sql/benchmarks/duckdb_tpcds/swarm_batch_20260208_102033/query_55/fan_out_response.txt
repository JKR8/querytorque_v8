WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Apply early filtering on dimension tables and push predicates down to reduce the size of intermediate results before joining.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_isolation_prefetch
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Pre-filter all dimension tables into separate CTEs and then join with the fact table to minimize the fact table scan cost.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Restructure using multiple CTEs to isolate date ranges and consolidate operations into single-pass aggregations for complex scenarios.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure by splitting OR conditions, converting INTERSECT to EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.
