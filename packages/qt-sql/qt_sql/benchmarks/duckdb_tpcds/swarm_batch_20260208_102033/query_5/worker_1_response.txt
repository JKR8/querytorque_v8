**Changes**: Created a filtered_dates CTE to isolate the 14-day date range and pushed this filter into each UNION ALL branch before joining with dimension tables. This reduces the volume of fact table rows early. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x due to early reduction of large fact tables (store_sales, store_returns, etc.) via filtered_dates before unions and dimension joins.
