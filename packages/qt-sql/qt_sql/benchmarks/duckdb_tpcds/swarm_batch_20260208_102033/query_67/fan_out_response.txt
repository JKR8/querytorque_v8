WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (date_dim, item, store) before joining, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize repeated expressions.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Isolate filtered dimensions into separate CTEs (date range, item categories) before joining with fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown and join planning.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_cte_restructuring
EXAMPLES: multi_date_range_cte, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Restructure with multiple CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions, defer window function computation until after aggregation to reduce data volume.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore radical transformations: split rollup into UNION ALL branches, convert implicit groupings to explicit structures, and decorrelate nested aggregations.
