**Changes**: Applied early filtering to the date_dim table by creating a derived table with only the necessary columns and rows before joining to store_sales, while preserving the exact ROLLUP structure and window function semantics.

**Expected speedup**: 1.3-1.7x by reducing the date_dim scan early and minimizing the join payload before the expensive ROLLUP aggregation.
