## Optimization Strategy: aggressive_cte_restructuring

**Your approach**: Restructure with multiple CTEs to pre-filter and pre-join dimensions, defer window function computation until after aggregation to reduce data volume.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate store sales quantity*price under a multi-level ROLLUP, compute rank by descending sumsales within each category, and retain rows with rank <= 100.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [*] — ordered by i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_brand ASC, i_product_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, d_moy ASC, s_store_id ASC, sumsales ASC, rk ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim, store, item
**Filters**: rk <= 100
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_brand,
    i_product_name,
    d_year,
    d_qoy,
    d_moy,
    s_store_id,
    sumsales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
  FROM (
    SELECT
      i_category,
      i_class,
      i_brand,
      i_product_name,
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. multi_date_range_cte (2.35x)

**Principle:** Early Selection per Alias: when a query joins the same dimension table multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3), create separate CTEs for each filter and pre-join with fact tables to reduce rows entering the main join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
     i_item_id
    ,i_item_desc
    ,s_store_id
    ,s_store_name
    ,avg(ss_quantity)        as store_sales_quantity
    ,avg(sr_return_quantity) as store_returns_quantity
    ,avg(cs_quantity)        as catalog_sales_quantity

    store_sales
   ,store_returns
   ,catalog_sales
   ,date_dim             d1
   ,date_dim             d2
   ,date_dim             d3
   ,store
   ,item
 where
     d1.d_moy               = 4 
 and d1.d_year              = 1999
 and d1.d_date_sk           = ss_sold_date_sk
 and i_item_sk              = ss_item_sk
 and s_store_sk             = ss_store_sk
 and ss_customer_sk         = sr_customer_sk
 and ss_item_sk             = sr_item_sk
 and ss_ticket_number       = sr_ticket_number
 and sr_returned_date_sk    = d2.d_date_sk
 and d2.d_moy               between 4 and  4 + 3 
 and d2.d_year              = 1999
 and sr_customer_sk         = cs_bill_customer_sk
 and sr_item_sk             = cs_item_sk
 and cs_sold_date_sk        = d3.d_date_sk     
 and d3.d_year              in (1999,1999+1,1999+2)
 group by
    i_item_id
   ,i_item_desc
   ,s_store_id
   ,s_store_name
 order by
    i_item_id 
   ,i_item_desc
   ,s_store_id
   ,s_store_name
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[d1_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy = 9 AND d_year = 1999
```
[d2_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_moy BETWEEN 9 AND 12 AND d_year = 1999
```
[d3_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year IN (1999, 2000, 2001)
```

```
[filtered_catalog_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_bill_customer_sk, cs_quantity FROM catalog_sales JOIN d3_dates ON catalog_sales.cs_sold_date_sk = d3_dates.d_date_sk

[main_query]:
```sql

```

### 2. multi_dimension_prefetch (2.71x)

**Principle:** Multi-Dimension Prefetch: when multiple dimension tables have selective filters, pre-filter ALL of them into CTEs before the fact table join. Combined selectivity compounds — each dimension CTE reduces the fact scan further.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select s_store_name, s_store_id,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Sunday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sun_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Monday') then ss_sales_price else null end) mon_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Tuesday') then ss_sales_price else  null end) tue_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Wednesday') then ss_sales_price else null end) wed_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Thursday') then ss_sales_price else null end) thu_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Friday') then ss_sales_price else null end) fri_sales,
        sum(case when (d_day_name='Saturday') then ss_sales_price else null end) sat_sales
 from date_dim, store_sales, store
 where d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk and
       s_store_sk = ss_store_sk and
       s_gmt_offset = -5 and
       d_year = 2000 
 group by s_store_name, s_store_id
 order by s_store_name, s_store_id,sun_sales,mon_sales,tue_sales,wed_sales,thu_sales,fri_sales,sat_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_day_name FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_stores]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_name, s_store_id FROM store WHERE s_gmt_offset = -5
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT s_store_name, s_store_id, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Sunday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sun_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Monday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS mon_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Tuesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS tue_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Wednesday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS wed_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Thursday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS thu_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Friday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS fri_sales, SUM(CASE WHEN (d_day_name = 'Saturday') THEN ss_sales_price ELSE NULL END) AS sat_sales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales LIMIT 100
```

### 3. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ss_sales_price))
      over (partition by ss_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from store_sales
    ,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[web_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM web_sales, date_dim WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
```
[store_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ss_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ss_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ss_item_sk, d_date
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk, COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date, SUM(web.daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative, SUM(store.daily_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) ORDER BY COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative FROM web_daily web FULL OUTER JOIN store_daily store ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date) y WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative ORDER BY item_sk, d_date LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: date_cte_isolate on q67 (0.85xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize dimension filters into CTEs before complex aggregations (ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS) with window functions. The optimizer needs to push aggregation through joins; CTEs create materialization barriers.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized date, store, and item dimension filters into CTEs before a ROLLUP aggregation with window functions (RANK() OVER). CTE materialization prevents the optimizer from pushing the ROLLUP and window computation down through the join tree, forcing a full materialized intermediate before the expensive aggregation.

### Warning 2: date_cte_isolate on q51 (0.87xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering together.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized cumulative window functions (SUM() OVER ORDER BY) into separate CTEs (web_v1, store_v1) before a FULL OUTER JOIN that filters on web_cumulative > store_cumulative. The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
