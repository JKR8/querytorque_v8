Changes: Applied aggressive multi-CTE prefetch by creating staged CTEs for filtered dimensions (item and date_dim) before joining with the fact table. This reduces the catalog_sales scan early by pushing down selective filters. The conditional aggregations remain consolidated in a single scan.

Expected speedup: ~2-3x by reducing fact table rows through early dimension filtering and maintaining single-pass aggregation.
