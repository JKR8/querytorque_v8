WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply filter pushdown and early dimension filtering to reduce join sizes, and materialize repeated subqueries to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce the data before joining.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join multiple dimension tables with fact tables in CTEs, and consolidate multiple aggregations into a single pass.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the query structure by splitting OR conditions, converting INTERSECT to EXISTS, and decorrelating multiple subqueries.
