Changes: Removed unnecessary store join, pre-filtered dimension tables using CTEs, decomposed OR condition into UNION ALL for better predicate optimization, and pre-aggregated sales before applying the window function.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from reduced join volume, early filtering, and better predicate evaluation.
