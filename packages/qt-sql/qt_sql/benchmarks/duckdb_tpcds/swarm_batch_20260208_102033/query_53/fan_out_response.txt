WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on early filtering of dimension tables and pushing predicates into CTEs to reduce join sizes before any expensive operations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate all dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs, then join with fact table to enable predicate pushdown and reuse filtered dimensions.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in CTEs, then compute aggregations and window functions in separate stages to optimize data flow.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
HINT: Transform complex OR conditions into UNION ALL branches and restructure subquery patterns to eliminate correlation and improve join planning.
