You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_early_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.12x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on pushing filters down to dimension tables early and materializing intermediate results to reduce join costs and avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow = 1
      AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_city
    FROM store
    WHERE s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
),
filtered_household AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_dep_count = 5
       OR hd_vehicle_count > 4
),
aggregated_sales AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        fs.s_city,
        SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_store fs ON ss.ss_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk
    JOIN filtered_household fh ON ss.ss_hdemo_sk = fh.hd_demo_sk
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, ss_addr_sk, fs.s_city
)
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, store, household_demographics) into CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce join sizes before the main aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dow = 1
    AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
), filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk, s_city
  FROM store
  WHERE s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
), filtered_household_demographics AS (
  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE hd_dep_count = 5 OR hd_vehicle_count > 4
), ms AS (
  SELECT
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    s_city,
    SUM(ss_coupon_amt) AS amt,
    SUM(ss_net_profit) AS profit
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_date ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = filtered_date.d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_store ON store_sales.ss_store_sk = filtered_store.s_store_sk
  JOIN filtered_household_demographics ON store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = filtered_household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
  GROUP BY
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    ss_addr_sk,
    s_city
)
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (1.09x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join with fact table in a staged CTE approach, then consolidate aggregations in a single pass to minimize intermediate data movement.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow = 1
      AND d_year IN (1998, 1998 + 1, 1998 + 2)
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_city
    FROM store
    WHERE s_number_employees BETWEEN 200 AND 295
),
filtered_hd AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_dep_count = 5 OR hd_vehicle_count > 4
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        ss_addr_sk,
        st.s_city,

    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_date fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_store st ON ss.ss_store_sk = st.s_store_sk
    JOIN filtered_hd hd ON ss.ss_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
    GROUP BY ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk, ss_addr_sk, st.s_city
)
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (1.13x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL for better index usage, and flatten any correlated subqueries (if present) to improve parallelization and join planning.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dow = 1
      AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)

      AND household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count <= 4

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
