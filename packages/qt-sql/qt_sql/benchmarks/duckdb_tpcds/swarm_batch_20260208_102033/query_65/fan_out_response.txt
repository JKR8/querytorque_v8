```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_materialization
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Push filters early into CTEs, materialize repeated subquery patterns once, and reduce intermediate dataset sizes through predicate pushdown.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Extract date and dimension filtering into isolated CTEs before joining with fact tables to enable better filter propagation and reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs, consolidate multiple aggregations into single-pass scans, and prefetch multiple dimension filters to minimize repeated work.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transformation
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure by splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, converting intersect patterns to EXISTS, and decorrelating subqueries into join-friendly CTEs.
