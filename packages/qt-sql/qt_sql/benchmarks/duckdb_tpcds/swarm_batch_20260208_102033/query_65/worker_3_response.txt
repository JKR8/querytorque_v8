Changes: Applied aggressive prefetch restructuring by: (1) creating filtered_dates CTE to pre-filter date range once, (2) creating filtered_sales CTE to compute store-item revenue in single pass, (3) computing store averages from filtered_sales in separate CTE, (4) joining these CTEs for the low-revenue filter before final dimension joins.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from eliminating duplicate fact table scans and pushing all date filtering early.
