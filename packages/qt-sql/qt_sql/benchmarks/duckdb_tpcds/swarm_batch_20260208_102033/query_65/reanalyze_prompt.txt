You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_materialization
- **Status**: pass (1.79x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push filters early into CTEs, materialize repeated subquery patterns once, and reduce intermediate dataset sizes through predicate pushdown.

```sql
WITH date_filter AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1221 AND 1232
),
store_item_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        ss_store_sk,
        ss_item_sk,
        SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue
    FROM store_sales
    JOIN date_filter ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY ss_store_sk, ss_item_sk
),
store_average AS (
    SELECT
        ss_store_sk,

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_date_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.80x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Extract date and dimension filtering into isolated CTEs before joining with fact tables to enable better filter propagation and reduce join cardinality.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1221 AND 1221 + 11
),

- **Status**: pass (1.84x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1221 AND 1221 + 11

    ss_store_sk,
    ss_item_sk,
    SUM(ss_sales_price) AS revenue

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
