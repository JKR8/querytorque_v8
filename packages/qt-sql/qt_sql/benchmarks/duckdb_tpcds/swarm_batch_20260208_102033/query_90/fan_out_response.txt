WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: First filter dimension tables aggressively before joining to fact tables, then push predicates into subqueries, and use CTE to avoid repeating the same filter logic.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create separate CTEs for pre-filtered dimension tables (household_demographics, time_dim, web_page) to enable better predicate pushdown and reuse them across both subqueries.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in CTEs, then restructure to compute both hour ranges in a single scan using conditional aggregation, eliminating duplicate subquery pattern.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the implicit cross join between subqueries using UNION ALL with case statements, or restructure as EXISTS patterns to enable different join strategies and reduce intermediate results.
