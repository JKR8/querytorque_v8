You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: First filter dimension tables aggressively before joining to fact tables, then push predicates into subqueries, and use CTE to avoid repeating the same filter logic.

```sql
WITH filtered_hd AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_dep_count = 2
),
filtered_wp AS (
    SELECT wp_web_page_sk
    FROM web_page
    WHERE wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
),
am_counts AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS amc
    FROM web_sales ws
    JOIN time_dim t ON ws.ws_sold_time_sk = t.t_time_sk
    JOIN filtered_hd hd ON ws.ws_ship_hdemo_sk = hd.hd_demo_sk
    JOIN filtered_wp wp ON ws.ws_web_page_sk = wp.wp_web_page_sk
    WHERE t.t_hour BETWEEN 10 AND 11
),
pm_counts AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS pmc
    FROM web_sales ws
    JOIN time_dim t ON ws.ws_sold_time_sk = t.t_time_sk

FROM am_counts, pm_counts
ORDER BY am_pm_ratio

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.02x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Create separate CTEs for pre-filtered dimension tables (household_demographics, time_dim, web_page) to enable better predicate pushdown and reuse them across both subqueries.

```sql
WITH filtered_household_demographics AS (
  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE hd_dep_count = 2
), filtered_web_page AS (
  SELECT wp_web_page_sk
  FROM web_page
  WHERE wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
), time_am AS (
  SELECT t_time_sk
  FROM time_dim
  WHERE t_hour BETWEEN 10 AND 10 + 1
), time_pm AS (
  SELECT t_time_sk
  FROM time_dim
  WHERE t_hour BETWEEN 16 AND 16 + 1
), am_counts AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS amc
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN time_am ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_am.t_time_sk
  JOIN filtered_household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = filtered_household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
  JOIN filtered_web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = filtered_web_page.wp_web_page_sk
), pm_counts AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS pmc
  FROM web_sales
  JOIN time_pm ON ws_sold_time_sk = time_pm.t_time_sk
  JOIN filtered_household_demographics ON ws_ship_hdemo_sk = filtered_household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
  JOIN filtered_web_page ON ws_web_page_sk = filtered_web_page.wp_web_page_sk
)
SELECT

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.07x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in CTEs, then restructure to compute both hour ranges in a single scan using conditional aggregation, eliminating duplicate subquery pattern.

```sql
WITH filtered_dimensions AS (
  SELECT 
    hd.hd_demo_sk,
    td.t_time_sk,
    td.t_hour,
    wp.wp_web_page_sk
  FROM household_demographics hd
  CROSS JOIN time_dim td
  CROSS JOIN web_page wp
  WHERE hd.hd_dep_count = 2
    AND wp.wp_char_count BETWEEN 5000 AND 5200
    AND td.t_hour IN (10, 11, 16, 17)
),
joined_data AS (
  SELECT 
    fd.t_hour
  FROM web_sales ws
  INNER JOIN filtered_dimensions fd
    ON ws.ws_sold_time_sk = fd.t_time_sk

  FROM joined_data
)
SELECT
  CAST(amc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) / CAST(pmc AS DECIMAL(15,4)) AS am_pm_ratio
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced column "ws_sold_time_sk" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "t_time", "t_meal_time", "t_time_sk", "t_time_id", "t_am_pm"

LINE 3:         ws_sold_time_sk,
                ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the implicit cross join between subqueries using UNION ALL with case statements, or restructure as EXISTS patterns to enable different join strategies and reduce intermediate results.

```sql
WITH time_ranges AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_sold_time_sk,

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
