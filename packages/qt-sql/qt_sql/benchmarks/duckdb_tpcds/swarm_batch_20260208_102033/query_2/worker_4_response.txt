**Changes**: Combined the two-year comparison into a single CTE that aggregates by both week and year, then performed a single self-join with year filters. This eliminates the redundant scans of the intermediate aggregated CTE and reduces the computation to a single-pass aggregation.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x by avoiding duplicate aggregation work and reducing CTE materialization overhead.
