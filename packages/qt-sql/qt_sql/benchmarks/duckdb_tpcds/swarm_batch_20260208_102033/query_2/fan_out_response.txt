WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
HINT: Push year filters into the earliest possible CTEs and isolate date_dim filtering to reduce data volume before expensive joins and aggregations.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: materialize_cte, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Restructure CTEs to avoid recomputation, pre-filter dimension tables, and consolidate shared dimension logic across both sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_split
EXAMPLES: union_cte_split, multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join
HINT: Split the UNION ALL into channel-specific CTEs, prefilter multiple dimensions, and pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables to minimize intermediate results.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation, or_to_union
HINT: Transform the two-year comparison into a single-pass aggregation using conditional logic, explore window-function alternatives, and consider UNION restructuring for branching logic.
