**Changes**: Isolated dimension table filtering into separate CTEs before joining with catalog_sales, creating a filtered fact table that reduces rows before evaluating the EXISTS conditions.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x due to early reduction of catalog_sales rows via pre-filtered dimension joins and preserved EXISTS short-circuiting.
