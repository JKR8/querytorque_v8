You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_16
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 16 in stream 0 using template query16.tpl
select 
   count(distinct cs_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(cs_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(cs_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
