**Changes:** Extracted the repeated date_dim filtering into a shared CTE (`filtered_dates`) to avoid recomputing the same date range three times, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer handling. This reduces three separate scans of date_dim with the same filter to a single scan.

**Expected speedup:** ~1.8-2.2x by eliminating redundant date_dim processing while preserving exact EXCEPT semantics.
