WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_prefilter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Push filters into subqueries and pre-filter dimension tables before joining to reduce data movement and avoid redundant scans.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_shared_dimension_cte
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, materialize_cte
HINT: Isolate date filtering into a CTE, reuse shared dimension filters across channels, and materialize repeated join patterns to minimize recomputation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_single_pass
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Prefetch filtered fact-dimension joins into CTEs, then consolidate the three sales-channel queries into a single CTE using conditional aggregation to scan fact tables once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_set_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform set operations (EXCEPT) into EXISTS/NOT EXISTS or UNION-based patterns, and decorrelate subqueries to enable more efficient join plans.
