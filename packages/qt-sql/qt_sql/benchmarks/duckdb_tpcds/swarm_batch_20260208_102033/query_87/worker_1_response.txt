**Changes**: 
1. Created a CTE `filtered_dates` to pre-filter the date dimension table once for the 12-month range, reducing redundant scans.
2. Converted implicit joins to explicit INNER JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
3. Each channel's subquery now joins with the pre-filtered dates CTE, ensuring the date filter is applied before joining with large fact tables.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.2x due to reduced date_dim scans from 3 to 1 and early filtering before large fact table joins.
