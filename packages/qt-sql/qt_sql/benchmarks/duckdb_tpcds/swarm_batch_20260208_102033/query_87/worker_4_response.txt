```

**Changes:** Transformed the EXCEPT operations into a single pass through the store sales set with NOT EXISTS checks for catalog and web sales, eliminating the need for multiple DISTINCT materializations and set operations.

**Expected speedup:** 1.8-2.5x by avoiding full materialization of all three sets and leveraging semi-join optimizations.
