## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply predicate pushdown to reduce intermediate result sizes, filter dimension tables early, and reuse computed CTEs to avoid redundant calculations.

### Worker 2: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: fail (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable better predicate pushdown and reduce fact table scans, especially for shared dimensions.

### Worker 3: aggressive_multi_cte_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (1.24x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins by prefetching filtered dimensions and pre-joining with facts in separate CTEs, and consolidate aggregations where possible.

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transforms
- **Status**: pass (0.37x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure by converting patterns (like INTERSECT) to EXISTS, splitting OR conditions into UNION ALL, and decorrelating subqueries for better join planning.

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
