**Changes**: 
1. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
2. Pushed item color and price filters into a filtered_item CTE to reduce rows early.
3. Created filtered_date CTEs for 2001 and 2002 to enable predicate pushdown.
4. Reused the base aggregation CTE with post-filtering for each year, avoiding redundant computation.
5. Preserved all original columns and ordering.

**Expected speedup**: 2-3x from early dimension filtering and reduced intermediate result sizes.
