  "failure_analysis": "The attempts fell short due to superficial application of optimization patterns without addressing the core computational bottlenecks. Worker 1's conservative pushdown missed crucial early filtering of large fact tables. Worker 2 incorrectly filtered date dimensions for d2/d3 when they shouldn't be restricted to 2001-2002. Worker 3 achieved moderate success (1.24x) by prefetching filters but failed to push item filtering into the expensive cs_ui CTE. Worker 4's structural transforms were inappropriate for this query pattern and caused regression. Worker 5 recycled partial optimizations without addressing the main cost driver: the cs_ui CTE performs a massive aggregation on catalog_sales/returns without any filtering, while the main query only needs items satisfying color/price conditions.",
  "unexplored": "1. **Push item filtering into cs_ui**: The cs_ui CTE aggregates ALL catalog items, but cross_sales only needs items meeting color/price conditions. Pre-filtering catalog tables by item attributes could reduce cs_ui by 95%+.\n2. **Consolidate fact table scans**: Instead of separate filtered CTEs, create a single filtered item set and use it to filter both catalog and store fact tables early.\n3. **Selective date filtering**: Only d1 (ss_sold_date_sk) needs year filtering; d2/d3 should remain unfiltered to avoid incorrect restrictions.\n4. **Aggressive fact reduction**: Pre-join store_sales with filtered items and dates before the 17-way join, dramatically reducing the largest fact table early.",
  "refined_strategy": "Create a unified filtered item CTE with color/price conditions. Use it to filter BOTH catalog tables in cs_ui AND store_sales early. Pre-join store_sales with filtered items and date_dim d1 (2001-2002) before joining with other dimensions. Maintain separate unfiltered date CTEs for d2/d3. Restructure cs_ui to join catalog tables with filtered items first, then aggregate only eligible items.",
