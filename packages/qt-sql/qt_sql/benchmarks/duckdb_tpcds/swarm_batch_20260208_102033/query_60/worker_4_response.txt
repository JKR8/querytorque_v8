Changes: Decorrelated the repeated subqueries into independent CTEs (filtered_items, filtered_date, filtered_address) and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax. This allows each dimension filter to be computed once and reused across all three sales channels, eliminating redundant subquery execution.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x by reducing repeated filtering work and enabling better join optimization.
