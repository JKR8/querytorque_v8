WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Start by filtering dimension tables individually before joining to reduce fact table rows; push all possible filters into CTEs; materialize expensive subpatterns.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create separate optimized CTEs for each filtered dimension (date, item, customer/address, store) before joining with fact table; isolate shared dimension logic.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact table in staged CTEs to maximize early reduction; restructure to compute aggregates in single passes where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform the zip code inequality into UNION ALL branches; explore EXISTS alternatives for the cross-table condition; decorrelate any implicit subqueries.
