**Changes**: Replaced correlated subquery with a window function that computes per-item average discount in a single pass over date- and manufacturer-filtered data, then filtered rows where discount exceeds 1.3x the computed average.

**Expected speedup**: ~2–3x by eliminating repeated subquery executions and reducing data movement.
