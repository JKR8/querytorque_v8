WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply basic filter pushdown to reduce data early in each subquery, pre-filter dimension tables before joins, and materialize repeated date filtering patterns into a shared CTE.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and item dimension filters into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling predicate pushdown and reuse across all sales channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in separate CTEs, then restructure the UNION ALL to consolidate aggregation logic and reduce passes over large tables.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform OR conditions on t_meal_time into UNION ALL branches, restructure the existing UNION ALL into specialized CTEs by channel, and explore EXISTS-based rewrites for potential join elimination.
