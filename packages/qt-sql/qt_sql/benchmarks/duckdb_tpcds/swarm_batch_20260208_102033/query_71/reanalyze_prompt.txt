You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (0.90x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply basic filter pushdown to reduce data early in each subquery, pre-filter dimension tables before joins, and materialize repeated date filtering patterns into a shared CTE.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
),
filtered_time AS (
    SELECT t_time_sk, t_hour, t_minute
    FROM time_dim
    WHERE t_meal_time IN ('breakfast', 'dinner')
),

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.97x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and item dimension filters into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling predicate pushdown and reuse across all sales channels.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
),
filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1
),

-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.94x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with each fact table in separate CTEs, then restructure the UNION ALL to consolidate aggregation logic and reduce passes over large tables.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_moy = 12 AND d_year = 1998
),

    SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manager_id = 1

    FROM time_dim
    WHERE t_meal_time IN ('breakfast', 'dinner')
),

    SELECT
        ws_ext_sales_price AS ext_price,
        ws_item_sk AS sold_item_sk,

    JOIN filtered_date ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.98x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions on t_meal_time into UNION ALL branches, restructure the existing UNION ALL into specialized CTEs by channel, and explore EXISTS-based rewrites for potential join elimination.

```sql
WITH filtered_time AS (
    SELECT t_time_sk, t_hour, t_minute
    FROM time_dim
    WHERE t_meal_time = 'breakfast' OR t_meal_time = 'dinner'

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
