WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Filter dimension tables (date_dim, customer_address, web_site) first into CTEs before joining with web_sales to reduce intermediate data volume. Push predicates into CTEs where possible.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date filtering into a dedicated CTE, materialize the ws_wh CTE to avoid recomputation, and share filtered dimension tables across all web_sales joins for consistency.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter dimensions into CTEs, then pre-join with web_sales early. Consolidate the two subquery checks on ws_wh into a single CTE with conditional logic to scan web_sales once.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union, or_to_union
HINT: Convert the dual IN subqueries to EXISTS clauses for better join planning. If any OR conditions emerge, split into UNION ALL. Consider decorrelating multiple subqueries into a pre-materialized distinct set.
