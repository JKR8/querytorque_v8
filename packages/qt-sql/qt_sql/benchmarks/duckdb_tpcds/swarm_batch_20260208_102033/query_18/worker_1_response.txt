Changes: Created CTEs for filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics cd1, customer_address, customer) to apply predicates early and reduce join cardinality. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
Expected speedup: 2-3x from early filtering of dimension tables before joining to large fact table.
