## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
- **Status**: pass (0.92x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Push date filters into CTEs early, pre-filter dimension tables before joining, and materialize reusable date-range CTEs to avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1998-08-05' AS DATE) AND 
                     (CAST('1998-08-05' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '30' DAY)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
