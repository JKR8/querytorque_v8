You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_86
## Target: 2.0x speedup

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.00x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by isolating filters early, pushing predicates down, and materializing reusable results to reduce join sizes and avoid recomputation.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11
),
sales_with_categories AS (
    SELECT 
        ws_net_paid,
        i_category,
        i_class
    FROM web_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
    JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk
)
SELECT
    SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class), 
                     CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
        ORDER BY SUM(ws_net_paid) DESC
    ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM sales_with_categories
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
ORDER BY
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END,
    rank_within_parent
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimension tables into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce fact table joins, focusing on date and item dimension isolation.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_category, i_class
  FROM item
)
SELECT
  SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
  i_category,
  i_class,
  GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class), 
                 CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
    ORDER BY SUM(ws_net_paid) DESC
  ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM web_sales
JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = ws_sold_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items ON i_item_sk = ws_item_sk

ORDER BY
  lochierarchy DESC,
  CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END,
  rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.08x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins using multi-CTE prefetching, pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts, and consolidating aggregations into a single scan to minimize intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11
),
filtered_sales AS (

    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    s.ws_net_paid
  FROM filtered_sales s
  JOIN item i ON s.ws_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
),
aggregated AS (
  SELECT
    SUM(ws_net_paid) AS total_sum,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.03x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1224 AND 1224 + 11
),
joined_base AS (
  SELECT

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
