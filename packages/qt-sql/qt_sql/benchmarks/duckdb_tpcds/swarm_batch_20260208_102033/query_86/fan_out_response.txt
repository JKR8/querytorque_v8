WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by isolating filters early, pushing predicates down, and materializing reusable results to reduce join sizes and avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Pre-filter dimension tables into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown and reduce fact table joins, focusing on date and item dimension isolation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure joins using multi-CTE prefetching, pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts, and consolidating aggregations into a single scan to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural query transformations by converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, rewriting INTERSECT patterns, and decorrelating complex subqueries for alternative join plans.
