Changes: Isolated date and item dimensions into separate CTEs with minimal necessary columns to enable predicate pushdown, reduced join cardinality by pre-filtering date_dim with month sequence predicate, and converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x due to reduced hash table sizes and earlier filtering of date dimension rows.
