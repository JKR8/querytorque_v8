WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters into CTEs, filtering dimensions before joins, and materializing the repeated item subquery to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (date, address, item) into reusable CTEs before joining with each fact table, enabling better predicate pushdown.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure by pre-joining filtered dimensions with facts in dedicated CTEs, then attempt to consolidate the three channel aggregations into a single pass where possible.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, decorrelate
HINT: Transform query structure by splitting OR conditions (color filter) into UNION branches, converting subquery patterns, and decorrelating where applicable for alternative execution paths.
