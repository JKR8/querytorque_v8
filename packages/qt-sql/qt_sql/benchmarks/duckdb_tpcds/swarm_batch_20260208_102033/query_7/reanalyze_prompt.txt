You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_7
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 7 in stream 0 using template query7.tpl
select i_item_id, 
        avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
        avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
        avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(ss_sales_price) agg4 
 from store_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_pushdown_filter
- **Status**: pass (1.01x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters down early, materializing filtered dimension tables first, and reducing join sizes before aggregation.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'W'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'
),
filtered_date_dim AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_promotion AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
)
SELECT
    i.i_item_id,
    AVG(ss.ss_quantity) AS agg1,
    AVG(ss.ss_list_price) AS agg2,
    AVG(ss.ss_coupon_amt) AS agg3,
    AVG(ss.ss_sales_price) AS agg4
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_customer_demographics cd ON ss.ss_cdemo_sk = cd.cd_demo_sk
JOIN filtered_date_dim d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_promotion p ON ss.ss_promo_sk = p.p_promo_sk
GROUP BY i.i_item_id
ORDER BY i.i_item_id
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.06x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate each filtered dimension into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling independent predicate pushdown and better join ordering.

```sql
WITH filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'W'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),

    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT
        ss_item_sk,
        ss_quantity,
        ss_list_price,
        ss_coupon_amt,

    FROM store_sales
    INNER JOIN filtered_customer_demographics ON ss_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_date ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    INNER JOIN filtered_promotion ON ss_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
)
SELECT
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.15x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, composite_decorrelate_union, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure joins via prefetching fact tables, decorrelate complex patterns, and defer expensive operations to minimize intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_customer_demographics AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk
    FROM customer_demographics
    WHERE cd_gender = 'F'
      AND cd_marital_status = 'W'
      AND cd_education_status = 'College'
),
filtered_promotion AS (
    SELECT p_promo_sk
    FROM promotion
    WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
),

)
SELECT
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.12x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL, rewrite subqueries with EXISTS, and leverage shared dimension filtering to exploit DuckDB's parallelization.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2001
),
filtered_cd AS (
    SELECT cd_demo_sk

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
