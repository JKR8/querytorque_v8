WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_filter
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, proven optimizations by pushing filters down early, materializing filtered dimension tables first, and reducing join sizes before aggregation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate each filtered dimension into separate CTEs before joining with the fact table, enabling independent predicate pushdown and better join ordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, composite_decorrelate_union, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Restructure joins via prefetching fact tables, decorrelate complex patterns, and defer expensive operations to minimize intermediate data.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Transform OR conditions into UNION ALL, rewrite subqueries with EXISTS, and leverage shared dimension filtering to exploit DuckDB's parallelization.
