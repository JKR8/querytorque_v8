Changes: Created three CTEs to isolate date filtering, customer filtering by ZIP codes, and item filtering by SK values. Used EXISTS semi-joins to push both OR conditions into a single scan of web_sales, avoiding expensive OR evaluation on large intermediate results. Aggregated sales after filtering to minimize data volume before joining to customer_address for final ZIP/city lookup.

Expected speedup: 2-3x by reducing web_sales scan through early semi-join filtering and avoiding OR evaluation on joined data.
