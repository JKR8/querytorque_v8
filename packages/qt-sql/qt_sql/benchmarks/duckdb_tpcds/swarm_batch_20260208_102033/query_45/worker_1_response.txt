**Changes:** 
1. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control
2. Created `filtered_date` CTE to isolate date dimension filtering
3. Created `filtered_item_ids` CTE to materialize the item subquery results once
4. Applied early filtering to date_dim and item tables before joining

**Expected speedup:** 1.8-2.2x - Early filtering reduces the fact table scan, materializing the item subquery avoids repeated execution, and explicit joins give the optimizer more freedom.
