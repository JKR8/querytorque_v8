Changes: Restructured with aggressive prefetching: created CTEs for filtered dimensions (date, address, items), split the OR condition into two separate join branches (address-based and item-based) using UNION ALL with anti-join to avoid duplicates, then combined for aggregation.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from reduced fact table scans via early dimension filtering and elimination of OR-condition evaluation during main join.
