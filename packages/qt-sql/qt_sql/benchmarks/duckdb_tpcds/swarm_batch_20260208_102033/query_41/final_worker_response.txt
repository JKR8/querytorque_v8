**Changes**: 
1. Created `filtered_items` CTE to immediately restrict to the selective i_manufact_id range (748-788) and project only needed columns.
2. Created `qualified_manufacturers` CTE that performs single-pass aggregation with CASE statements to compute per-manufacturer qualification counts in one scan of filtered_items.
3. Replaced correlated subquery with efficient join between filtered items and qualified manufacturers.
4. Used DISTINCT only at final stage to deduplicate product names.

**Expected speedup**: 3-5x by eliminating correlated subquery, reducing repeated scans, and leveraging early filtering on the selective i_manufact_id predicate.
