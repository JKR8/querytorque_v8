Changes: Each OR condition has been decomposed into a UNION ALL of three separate branches per quantity bucket, enabling focused predicate evaluation and potential index usage on `ss_list_price`, `ss_coupon_amt`, and `ss_wholesale_cost`. The aggregates are computed from materialized CTEs that collect the relevant rows without complex OR filters.

Expected speedup: 2.0-3.0x due to reduced predicate complexity and better scan efficiency per column range.
