**Changes**: 
1. Created a `filtered_dates` CTE to isolate the date dimension filter and pre-join only the necessary date rows with the fact table.
2. Combined all dimension tables with the fact table in a single CTE (`prejoined`) to reduce data early.
3. Computed aggregates and window functions on the reduced dataset.
4. Replaced the expensive 3-way self-join with `LAG`/`LEAD` window functions to get previous/next month sales.
5. Added explicit `IS NOT NULL` checks to match the original inner join semantics.

**Expected speedup**: ~2-3x by eliminating the 3-way self-join and prefetching filtered dimensions before aggregation.
