You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_32
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 32 in stream 0 using template query32.tpl
select sum(cs_ext_discount_amt)  as "excess discount amount" 
from 
   catalog_sales 
   ,item 
   ,date_dim
where
i_manufact_id = 29
and i_item_sk = cs_item_sk 
and d_date between '1999-01-07' and 
        (cast('1999-01-07' as date) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk 
and cs_ext_discount_amt  
     > ( 
         select 
            1.3 * avg(cs_ext_discount_amt) 
         from 
            catalog_sales 
           ,date_dim
         where 
              cs_item_sk = i_item_sk 
          and d_date between '1999-01-07' and
                             (cast('1999-01-07' as date) + INTERVAL 90 DAY)
          and d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk 
      )
 LIMIT 100;

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.67x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (item, date_dim) before joining with catalog_sales, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize the repeated subquery pattern to avoid redundant computation.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (
    CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY
  )
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk
  FROM item
  WHERE i_manufact_id = 29
),
item_avg_discount AS (
  SELECT
    cs_item_sk,
    1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
  FROM catalog_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
  GROUP BY cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
  SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN filtered_items ON i_item_sk = cs_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = cs_sold_date_sk
JOIN item_avg_discount ON catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = item_avg_discount.cs_item_sk
WHERE cs_ext_discount_amt > threshold
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.61x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate filtered dimension tables into separate CTEs to reduce join cardinality early, especially for date ranges, and share pre-filtered dimensions across main and subquery.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY)
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manufact_id = 29
),
item_avg_discount AS (
    SELECT
        cs_item_sk,
        1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS avg_discount
    FROM catalog_sales
    JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
    GROUP BY cs_item_sk
)
SELECT
    SUM(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS "excess discount amount"
FROM catalog_sales
JOIN filtered_items ON cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
JOIN item_avg_discount ON catalog_sales.cs_item_sk = item_avg_discount.cs_item_sk
WHERE cs_ext_discount_amt > item_avg_discount.avg_discount
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
- **Status**: pass (0.44x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact tables in staged CTEs, then restructure the correlated subquery into a single-pass aggregation to eliminate per-row execution.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY)
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk
    FROM item
    WHERE i_manufact_id = 29
),
sales_with_dates AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_item_sk,
        cs_ext_discount_amt,
        cs_sold_date_sk
    FROM catalog_sales
    WHERE cs_sold_date_sk IN (SELECT d_date_sk FROM filtered_dates)
),
item_avg_discount AS (
    SELECT 
        cs_item_sk,
        1.3 * AVG(cs_ext_discount_amt) AS threshold
    FROM sales_with_dates
    GROUP BY cs_item_sk
),
filtered_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        s.cs_ext_discount_amt
    FROM sales_with_dates s
    JOIN filtered_items i ON s.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
-- ... (truncated)

### Worker 4: novel_correlation_transform
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Ambiguous reference to column name "cs_item_sk" (use: "catalog_sales.cs_item_sk" or "item_avg_discount.cs_item_sk")
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: decorrelate, composite_decorrelate_union, intersect_to_exists
- **Strategy hint**: Decouple the correlated subquery via GROUP BY CTE and JOIN, transform conditional logic using set operations, and explore EXISTS semantics for alternative execution plans.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN '1999-01-07' AND (CAST('1999-01-07' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '90' DAY)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
