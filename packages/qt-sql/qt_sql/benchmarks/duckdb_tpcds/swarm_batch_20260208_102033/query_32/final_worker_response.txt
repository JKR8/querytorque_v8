Changes: Replaced correlated subquery with a single CTE that filters sales by date and manufacturer, computes per-item average via window function, then filters rows where discount exceeds threshold.

Expected speedup: 2-4x by eliminating correlated subquery execution per row and computing averages only for manufacturer 29 items in the date range.
