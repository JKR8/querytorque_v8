**Changes**: Created filtered CTEs for date, demographics, and store dimensions before joining with the large fact table, isolating small hash tables to accelerate the main join. Used explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.

**Expected speedup**: 2.0x-2.5x due to early filtering of dimensions creating small hash tables, reducing the fact table join size significantly while maintaining semantic equivalence.
