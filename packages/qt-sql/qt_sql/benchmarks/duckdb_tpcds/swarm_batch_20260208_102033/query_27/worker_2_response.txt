Changes: Isolated filtered dimensions (date, store, customer_demographics) into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown, then joined them directly with the fact table. This reduces the fact table scan early by applying selective filters from small dimension hash tables.

Expected speedup: 2-3x from reduced fact table scanning and better join order optimization.
