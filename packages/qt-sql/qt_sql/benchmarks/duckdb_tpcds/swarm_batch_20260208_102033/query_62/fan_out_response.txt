WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_filtering
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply dimension table filtering first, then join to fact tables to reduce data volume early. Use CTEs to materialize filtered dimensions and push filters into subqueries.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into separate CTEs before joining. This enables better predicate pushdown and reduces intermediate result sizes during joins.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: multi_dimension_prefetch, prefetch_fact_join, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter ALL dimension tables into CTEs, then pre-join with the fact table in stages. Use multi-step CTE chains to control join order and materialization.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore radical query restructuring by converting conditional logic to UNION ALL branches, transforming set operations, and decorrelating complex patterns even if not directly present.
