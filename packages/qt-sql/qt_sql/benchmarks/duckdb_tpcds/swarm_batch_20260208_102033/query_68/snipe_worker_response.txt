Changes: Extracted filtered dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) into separate CTEs before joining with the large fact table (store_sales), reducing the working set early. The main aggregation now operates on pre-filtered dimension keys.

Expected speedup: 1.8-2.2x due to reduced hash table sizes and earlier row elimination.
