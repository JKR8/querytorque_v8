## Optimization Strategy: novel_structural_transform

**Your approach**: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches, decorrelate multiple subqueries into pre-materialized CTEs, and convert correlated subqueries to joins for better parallelism.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_68_w4

```sql
SELECT
  c_last_name,
  c_first_name,
  ca_city,
  bought_city,
  ss_ticket_number,
  extended_price,
  extended_tax,
  list_price
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    ca_city AS bought_city,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS extended_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_list_price) AS list_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_tax) AS extended_tax
  FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer_address
  WHERE
    store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk
    AND store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk
    AND date_dim.d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND (
      household_demographics.hd_dep_count = 8
      OR household_demographics.hd_vehicle_count = -1
    )
    AND date_dim.d_year IN (1998, 1998 + 1, 1998 + 2)
    AND store.s_city IN ('Pleasant Hill', 'Five Points')
  GROUP BY
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    ss_addr_sk,
    ca_city
) AS dn, customer, customer_address AS current_addr
WHERE
  ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
  AND customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
  AND current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
ORDER BY
  c_last_name,
  ss_ticket_number
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate ticket measures by customer and bought city under day/month/year/store/household filters, join to customer current address, filter city mismatch, and output customer/ticket details.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_last_name, c_first_name, ca_city, bought_city, ss_ticket_number, extended_price, extended_tax, list_price] — ordered by c_last_name ASC, ss_ticket_number ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer_address, customer (join), customer_address AS current_addr (join)
**Joins**: ss_customer_sk = c_customer_sk | customer.c_current_addr_sk = current_addr.ca_address_sk
**Filters**: current_addr.ca_city <> bought_city
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[customer], SEQ_SCAN[customer_address], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_last_name,
  c_first_name,
  ca_city,
  bought_city,
  ss_ticket_number,
  extended_price,
  extended_tax,
  list_price
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_ticket_number,
    ss_customer_sk,
    ca_city AS bought_city,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS extended_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_list_price) AS list_price,
    SUM(ss_ext_tax) AS extended_tax
  FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, household_demographics, customer_address
  WHERE
    store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

### 2. composite_decorrelate_union (2.42x)

**Principle:** Composite Decorrelation: when multiple correlated EXISTS share common filters, extract shared dimensions into a single CTE and decorrelate the EXISTS checks into pre-materialized key sets joined via UNION.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select  
  ca_state,
  cd_gender,
  cd_marital_status,
  cd_dep_count,
  count(*) cnt1,
  max(cd_dep_count),
  sum(cd_dep_count),
  max(cd_dep_count),
  cd_dep_employed_count,
  count(*) cnt2,
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  sum(cd_dep_employed_count),
  max(cd_dep_employed_count),
  cd_dep_college_count,
  count(*) cnt3,
  max(cd_dep_college_count),
  sum(cd_dep_college_count),
  max(cd_dep_college_count)
 from
  customer c,customer_address ca,customer_demographics
 where
  c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk and
  cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk and 
  exists (select *
          from store_sales,date_dim
          where c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk and
                ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                d_year = 2001 and
                d_qoy < 4) and
   (exists (select *
            from web_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = ws_bill_customer_sk and
                  ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4) or 
    exists (select * 
            from catalog_sales,date_dim
            where c.c_customer_sk = cs_ship_customer_sk and
                  cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
                  d_year = 2001 and
                  d_qoy < 4))
 group by ca_state,
          cd_gender,
          cd_marital_status,
          cd_dep_count,
          cd_dep_employed_count,
          cd_dep_college_count
 order by ca_state,
          cd_gender,
          cd_marital_status,
          cd_dep_count,
          cd_dep_employed_count,
          cd_dep_college_count
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4
```
[store_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ss_customer_sk FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[web_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_bill_customer_sk FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[catalog_customers]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT cs_ship_customer_sk FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
```
[web_or_catalog_customers]:
```sql
SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk AS customer_sk FROM web_customers UNION SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk AS customer_sk FROM catalog_customers
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), cd_dep_employed_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt2, MAX(cd_dep_employed_count), SUM(cd_dep_employed_count), MAX(cd_dep_employed_count), cd_dep_college_count, COUNT(*) AS cnt3, MAX(cd_dep_college_count), SUM(cd_dep_college_count), MAX(cd_dep_college_count) FROM customer AS c JOIN customer_address AS ca ON c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk JOIN customer_demographics ON cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk JOIN store_customers AS sc ON c.c_customer_sk = sc.ss_customer_sk JOIN web_or_catalog_customers AS wcc ON c.c_customer_sk = wcc.customer_sk GROUP BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count ORDER BY ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cd_dep_employed_count, cd_dep_college_count LIMIT 100
```

### 3. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: semantic_rewrite on q95 (0.54xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not decompose tightly-correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS clause pairs into independent CTEs. Their cardinality estimates depend on each other; materializing them independently causes severe join cost misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Materialized complex correlated EXISTS/NOT EXISTS logic into independent CTEs (multi_warehouse_orders, returned_multi_warehouse_orders). The original EXISTS clauses were tightly correlated and evaluated together. Decoupling them into CTEs severed their cardinality relationship, causing 4x+ join estimate errors.

### Warning 2: date_cte_isolate on q25 (0.5xx)
**Anti-pattern:** Do not pre-filter and materialize fact tables when the query has 3+ fact table joins. The optimizer needs freedom to reorder multi-way fact joins and push filters across them.
**Why it regressed:** Pre-filtered and joined store_sales to date CTE BEFORE the 3-way fact table join (store_sales <- store_returns <- catalog_sales). By materializing the date-filtered store_sales early, the optimizer loses the ability to push filters across the multi-way fact join and reorder joins optimally.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_last_name`
  2. `c_first_name`
  3. `ca_city`
  4. `bought_city`
  5. `ss_ticket_number`
  6. `extended_price`
  7. `extended_tax`
  8. `list_price`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
