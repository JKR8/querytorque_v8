You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply early filtering on dimension tables before joining to fact tables, push predicates into subqueries, and materialize repeated subquery patterns to reduce redundant computation.

```sql
WITH
-- Early filter on dimension tables to reduce join size
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
      AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_city
    FROM store
    WHERE s_city IN ('Pleasant Hill', 'Five Points')
),
filtered_hd AS (
    SELECT hd_demo_sk
    FROM household_demographics
    WHERE hd_dep_count = 8 OR hd_vehicle_count = -1
),
filtered_ca AS (
    SELECT ca_address_sk, ca_city
    FROM customer_address
),
-- Pre-aggregated fact data with early filtering
dn AS (
    SELECT
        ss_ticket_number,
        ss_customer_sk,
        filtered_ca.ca_city AS bought_city,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS extended_price,
        SUM(ss_ext_list_price) AS list_price,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (1.11x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and other dimension filters into separate CTEs to enable predicate pushdown, then pre-join filtered dimensions with the fact table in a controlled sequence.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d_year IN (1998, 1998 + 1, 1998 + 2)
),
filtered_store AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk
  FROM store
  WHERE s_city IN ('Pleasant Hill', 'Five Points')
),

  SELECT hd_demo_sk
  FROM household_demographics
  WHERE hd_dep_count = 8
     OR hd_vehicle_count = -1
),

```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (1.10x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimensions and pre-join them with the fact table in CTEs, consolidate multiple aggregations into a single pass, and defer window computations to minimize intermediate data.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.67x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, composite_decorrelate_union, decorrelate
- **Strategy hint**: Transform OR conditions on different columns into UNION ALL branches, decorrelate multiple subqueries into pre-materialized CTEs, and convert correlated subqueries to joins for better parallelism.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_dom BETWEEN 1 AND 2
    AND d_year IN (1998, 1999, 2000)

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
