WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_earlyfilter
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on pushing filters into CTEs early, materializing repeated dimension lookups, and reducing intermediate result sizes through standard predicate pushdown.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Extract date and dimension filters into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling predicate pushdown and reducing redundant joins across channels.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact tables in separate CTEs, then consider consolidating multi-channel aggregations into a single scan for radical join reduction.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Explore structural query transformations like converting OR conditions to UNION ALL, rewriting subquery patterns, and decorrelating nested aggregations for alternative execution plans.
