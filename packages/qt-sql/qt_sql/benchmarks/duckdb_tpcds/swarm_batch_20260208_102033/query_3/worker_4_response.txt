```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_moy = 11
),
filtered_items AS (
  SELECT i_item_sk, i_brand_id, i_brand
  FROM item
  WHERE i_manufact_id = 816
)
SELECT
  fd.d_year,
  fi.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
  fi.i_brand AS brand,
  SUM(ss.ss_sales_price) AS sum_agg
FROM store_sales ss
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN filtered_items fi ON ss.ss_item_sk = fi.i_item_sk
GROUP BY

**Changes**: Applied dimension isolation by creating filtered CTEs for date_dim and item with their respective filters before joining with the fact table store_sales. This allows early filtering and reduces the size of joined data.

**Expected speedup**: 1.3-1.7x. The rewrite isolates dimension table filtering into separate CTEs, allowing the optimizer to:
1. Apply filters early on smaller dimension tables
2. Use more efficient join strategies (potentially hash joins) with pre-filtered results
3. Reduce the working set size before aggregation
