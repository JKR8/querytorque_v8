**Changes**: 
1. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
2. Pushed May 2000 date filter into materialized CTEs (`may_2000_dates`, `catalog_sales_may_2000`, `web_sales_may_2000`) to reduce fact table scans.
3. Changed IN subqueries to EXISTS for better semi-join performance while preserving semantics.
4. Kept all original CTEs intact with their exact logic to avoid semantic changes.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x due to reduced data volumes from early date filtering and more efficient semi-joins.
