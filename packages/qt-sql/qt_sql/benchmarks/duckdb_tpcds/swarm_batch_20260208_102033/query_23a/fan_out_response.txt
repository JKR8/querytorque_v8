WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe, low-risk optimizations: push filters into CTEs early, materialize reusable subqueries, and filter dimension tables before joining to reduce data volumes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs to enable predicate pushdown across multiple channel fact tables and reduce repeated scans.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_multi_cte_restructure
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Restructure CTEs by prefetching dimension-filtered fact joins, isolating multiple dimension filters, and consolidating similar subqueries into single-pass aggregations.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, or_to_union, union_cte_split
HINT: Transform query structure: convert subquery patterns to EXISTS, split OR conditions into UNION ALL branches, and specialize UNION ALL CTEs for better filter pushdown.
