## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_filter_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (1.14x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Apply safe, low-risk optimizations: push filters into CTEs early, materialize reusable subqueries, and filter dimension tables before joining to reduce data volumes.

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: error (0.00x)
- **Error**: Binder Error: Referenced column "d_date" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "d_date_sk", "ss_sold_date_sk", "i_category", "i_category_id", "i_item_sk"

LINE 22:     d_date
             ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate date and dimension filtering into dedicated CTEs to enable predicate pushdown across multiple channel fact tables and reduce repeated scans.

LINE 33:     d_date
             ^
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Restructure CTEs by prefetching dimension-filtered fact joins, isolating multiple dimension filters, and consolidating similar subqueries into single-pass aggregations.

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (1.21x)
- **Transforms**: none

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
