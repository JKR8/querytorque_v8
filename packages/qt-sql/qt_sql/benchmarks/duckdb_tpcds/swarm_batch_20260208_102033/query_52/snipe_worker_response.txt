```sql

JOIN filtered_dates fd ON store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk

```
Changes: Converted implicit joins to explicit JOINs and isolated filtered dimension tables (date_dim, item) into CTEs before joining with the large fact table store_sales. This allows DuckDB to build small hash tables from the pre-filtered dimensions and perform efficient hash joins.

Expected speedup: 2.0x–2.5x by reducing the hash table build cost and enabling better join order optimization.
