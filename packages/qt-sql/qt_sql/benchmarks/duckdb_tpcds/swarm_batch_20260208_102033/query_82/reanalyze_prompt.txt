You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_82
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 82 in stream 0 using template query82.tpl
select i_item_id
       ,i_item_desc
       ,i_current_price
 from item, inventory, date_dim, store_sales
 where i_current_price between 17 and 17+30
 and inv_item_sk = i_item_sk
 and d_date_sk=inv_date_sk
 and d_date between cast('1999-07-09' as date) and (cast('1999-07-09' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
 and i_manufact_id in (639,169,138,339)
 and inv_quantity_on_hand between 100 and 500
 and ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
 group by i_item_id,i_item_desc,i_current_price
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 82 in stream 0 using template query82.tpl
```

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
- **Strategy hint**: Focus on moving filters as early as possible in the query plan. Filter dimension tables first, then push predicates into joins. Use CTE materialization for clarity but keep transformations minimal.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 17 AND 17 + 30
      AND i_manufact_id IN (639, 169, 138, 339)
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) 
                     AND (CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY)
),
filtered_inventory AS (
    SELECT inv_item_sk, inv_date_sk
    FROM inventory
    WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
)
SELECT
    fi.i_item_id,
    fi.i_item_desc,
    fi.i_current_price
FROM filtered_item fi
JOIN filtered_inventory inv ON fi.i_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk
JOIN filtered_date d ON inv.inv_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
JOIN store_sales ss ON fi.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
GROUP BY
    fi.i_item_id,
    fi.i_item_desc,
    fi.i_current_price
ORDER BY
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 2: dimension_prefilter_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.95x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Create separate CTEs for each pre-filtered dimension table (item, date_dim) before joining with fact tables. Isolate shared dimension filters to avoid repeated computation.

```sql
WITH filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 17 AND 17 + 30
      AND i_manufact_id IN (639, 169, 138, 339)
), filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) AND (
        CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY
    )
)
SELECT
    fi.i_item_id,
    fi.i_item_desc,
    fi.i_current_price
FROM filtered_items fi
JOIN inventory inv ON fi.i_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk
JOIN filtered_dates fd ON inv.inv_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
JOIN store_sales ss ON fi.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
WHERE inv.inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
GROUP BY
    fi.i_item_id,
    fi.i_item_desc,
    fi.i_current_price
ORDER BY
    fi.i_item_id
LIMIT 100
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_fact_prefetch
- **Status**: pass (1.21x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs to reduce intermediate result sizes. Consolidate multiple fact table accesses and push aggregation earlier in the pipeline.

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_item_id,
        i_item_desc,
        i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 17 AND 17 + 30
      AND i_manufact_id IN (639, 169, 138, 339)
),
filtered_date AS (
    SELECT 
        d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) 
                     AND (CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY)
),
filtered_inventory AS (
    SELECT 
        inv_item_sk
    FROM inventory
    JOIN filtered_date ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
    WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
),
item_inventory AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_item_id,
        i_item_desc,
        i_current_price
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: structural_query_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.45x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
- **Strategy hint**: Transform query structure fundamentally: convert IN clause to UNION ALL, explore EXISTS transformations, and decorrelate any implicit dependencies for better join planning.

```sql
WITH
filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_date BETWEEN CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) 
        AND (CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY)
),

    SELECT inv_item_sk, inv_date_sk
    FROM inventory
    WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
),
joined_inv_date AS (
    SELECT inv_item_sk
    FROM filtered_inventory
    JOIN filtered_dates ON filtered_inventory.inv_date_sk = filtered_dates.d_date_sk
),
manufacturer_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price
    FROM item
    WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 17 AND 17 + 30
      AND i_manufact_id IN (639, 169, 138, 339)
),
store_items AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT ss_item_sk
    FROM store_sales
)
SELECT
    manufacturer_items.i_item_id,
    manufacturer_items.i_item_desc,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (1.14x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_item AS (
    SELECT 
        i_item_sk,
        i_item_id,
        i_item_desc,

                     AND (CAST('1999-07-09' AS DATE) + INTERVAL '60' DAY)
), filtered_inventory AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        inv_item_sk
    FROM inventory
    JOIN filtered_date ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk
    WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500
), qualified_items AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        fi.i_item_id,
        fi.i_item_desc,
        fi.i_current_price
    FROM filtered_item fi
    JOIN filtered_inventory finv ON fi.i_item_sk = finv.inv_item_sk
    WHERE EXISTS (

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
