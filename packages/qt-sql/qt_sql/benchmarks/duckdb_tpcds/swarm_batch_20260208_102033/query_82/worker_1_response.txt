**Changes**: Created three CTEs to filter dimension tables (item, date_dim, inventory) before joining with the fact table (store_sales). Each CTE applies its specific filter conditions early, reducing the data volume for subsequent joins.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x by reducing join cardinality through early predicate pushdown to dimension tables.
