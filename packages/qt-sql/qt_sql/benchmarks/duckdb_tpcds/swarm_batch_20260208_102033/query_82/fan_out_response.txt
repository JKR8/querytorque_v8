WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_predicate_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Focus on moving filters as early as possible in the query plan. Filter dimension tables first, then push predicates into joins. Use CTE materialization for clarity but keep transformations minimal.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_prefilter_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Create separate CTEs for each pre-filtered dimension table (item, date_dim) before joining with fact tables. Isolate shared dimension filters to avoid repeated computation.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables in CTEs to reduce intermediate result sizes. Consolidate multiple fact table accesses and push aggregation earlier in the pipeline.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_query_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform query structure fundamentally: convert IN clause to UNION ALL, explore EXISTS transformations, and decorrelate any implicit dependencies for better join planning.
