## Optimization Strategy: novel_structural_transforms

**Your approach**: Transform INTERSECT operations to EXISTS/JOIN patterns for better optimizer planning. Decorrelate subqueries and convert OR conditions to UNION ALL for selective execution.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

---

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. cross_items
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Build the shared item set by intersecting brand/class/category combinations that appear in store, catalog, and web sales during 2000-2002, then map those combinations back to item keys.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows
**Outputs**: [ss_item_sk]
**Dependencies**: item, web_sales (join), item AS iws (join), date_dim AS d3 (join), store_sales (join), item AS iss (join), date_dim AS d1 (join), catalog_sales (join), item AS ics (join), date_dim AS d2 (join)
**Joins**: i_brand_id = brand_id | i_class_id = class_id | i_category_id = category_id
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  i_item_sk AS ss_item_sk
FROM item, (
  SELECT
    iss.i_brand_id AS brand_id,
    iss.i_class_id AS class_id,
    iss.i_category_id AS category_id
  FROM store_sales, item AS iss, date_dim AS d1
  WHERE
    ss_item_sk = iss.i_item_sk
    AND ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
    AND d1.d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  INTERSECT
  SELECT
    ics.i_brand_id,
    ics.i_class_id,
    ics.i_category_id
  FROM catalog_sales, item AS ics, date_dim AS d2
  WHERE
    cs_item_sk = ics.i_item_sk
...
```

### 2. avg_sales
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Compute a cross-channel average of quantity*list_price over store, catalog, and web sales for 2000-2002 to serve as the sales threshold.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows
**Flags**: UNION_ALL
**Outputs**: [average_sales]
**Dependencies**: web_sales, date_dim, store_sales, catalog_sales
**Joins**: ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store_sales]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  AVG(quantity * list_price) AS average_sales
FROM (
  SELECT
    ss_quantity AS quantity,
    ss_list_price AS list_price
  FROM store_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    cs_quantity AS quantity,
    cs_list_price AS list_price
  FROM catalog_sales, date_dim
  WHERE
    cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2000 + 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    ws_quantity AS quantity,
    ws_list_price AS list_price
...
```

### 3. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Intent**: Aggregate November 2002 sales for each channel over the cross-channel item set, keep groups above the computed average-sales threshold, union channels, and output rollup subtotals by channel and product hierarchy.
**Stats**: 33% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [channel, i_brand_id, i_class_id, i_category_id, SUM(sales), SUM(number_sales)] — ordered by channel ASC, i_brand_id ASC, i_class_id ASC, i_category_id ASC
**Dependencies**: web_sales, item, date_dim, store_sales, catalog_sales, avg_sales, cross_items
**Joins**: ws_item_sk = i_item_sk | ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: ws_item_sk IN (SELECT ss_item_sk FROM cross_items) | d_year = 2000 + 2 | d_moy = 11
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, HASH_JOIN, SEQ_SCAN[web_sales], SEQ_SCAN[item], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  channel,
  i_brand_id,
  i_class_id,
  i_category_id,
  SUM(sales),
  SUM(number_sales)
FROM (
  SELECT
    'store' AS channel,
    i_brand_id,
    i_class_id,
    i_category_id,
    SUM(ss_quantity * ss_list_price) AS sales,
    COUNT(*) AS number_sales
  FROM store_sales, item, date_dim
  WHERE
    ss_item_sk IN (
      SELECT
        ss_item_sk
...

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. intersect_to_exists (1.83x)

**Principle:** Semi-Join Short-Circuit: replace INTERSECT with EXISTS to avoid full materialization and sorting. INTERSECT must compute complete result sets before intersecting; EXISTS stops at the first match per row, enabling semi-join optimizations.

SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE i_item_sk IN (SELECT ss_item_sk FROM cross_items_flat) ...
```

### 2. decorrelate (2.92x)

**Principle:** Decorrelation: convert correlated subqueries to standalone CTEs with GROUP BY, then JOIN. Correlated subqueries re-execute per outer row; a pre-computed CTE executes once.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr.sr_customer_sk, sr.sr_store_sk, sr.sr_fee FROM store_returns sr JOIN date_dim d ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = d.d_date_sk JOIN store s ON sr.sr_store_sk = s.s_store_sk WHERE d.d_year = 2000 AND s.s_state = 'SD'
```
[customer_total_return]:
```sql
SELECT sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk, SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return FROM filtered_returns GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
```
[store_avg_return]:
```sql
SELECT ctr_store_sk, AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 AS avg_return_threshold FROM customer_total_return GROUP BY ctr_store_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT c.c_customer_id FROM customer_total_return ctr1 JOIN store_avg_return sar ON ctr1.ctr_store_sk = sar.ctr_store_sk JOIN customer c ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > sar.avg_return_threshold ORDER BY c.c_customer_id LIMIT 100
```

### 3. or_to_union (3.17x)

**Principle:** OR-to-UNION Decomposition: split OR conditions on different columns into separate UNION ALL branches, each with a focused predicate. The optimizer can use different access paths per branch instead of a single scan with a complex filter.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ca_zip
       ,sum(cs_sales_price)
 from catalog_sales
     ,customer
     ,customer_address
     ,date_dim
 where cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
 	and c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk 
 	and ( substr(ca_zip,1,5) in ('85669', '86197','88274','83405','86475',
                                   '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792')
 	      or ca_state in ('CA','WA','GA')
 	      or cs_sales_price > 500)
 	and cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
 	and d_qoy = 1 and d_year = 2001
 group by ca_zip
 order by ca_zip
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_qoy = 1 AND d_year = 2001
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql
SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE substr(ca_zip,1,5) IN ('85669', '86197', '88274', '83405', '86475', '85392', '85460', '80348', '81792') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE ca_state IN ('CA','WA','GA') UNION ALL SELECT cs_sales_price, ca_zip FROM catalog_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN customer ON cs_bill_customer_sk = c_customer_sk JOIN customer_address ON c_current_addr_sk = ca_address_sk WHERE cs_sales_price > 500
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ca_zip, SUM(cs_sales_price) FROM filtered_sales GROUP BY ca_zip ORDER BY ca_zip LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following transforms were attempted on structurally similar queries
and caused performance regressions. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: pushdown on q74 (0.68xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When splitting a UNION CTE by year, you MUST remove or replace the original UNION CTE. Keeping both the split and original versions causes redundant materialization and extreme cardinality misestimates.
**Why it regressed:** Created year-specific CTEs (store_sales_1999, store_sales_2000, etc.) but KEPT the original year_total union CTE alongside them. The optimizer materializes both the split versions and the original union, resulting in redundant computation. Projection cardinality estimates show 10^16x errors from the confused CTE graph.

### Warning 2: pushdown on q31 (0.49xx)
**Anti-pattern:** When creating filtered versions of existing CTEs, always REMOVE the original unfiltered CTEs. Keeping both causes redundant materialization and 1000x+ cardinality misestimates on self-joins.
**Why it regressed:** Created both filtered (store_sales_agg, web_sales_agg) AND original (ss, ws) versions of the same aggregations. The query does a 6-way self-join matching quarterly patterns (Q1->Q2->Q3). Duplicate CTEs doubled materialization and confused the optimizer's cardinality estimates for the multi-self-join.

The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `channel`
  2. `i_brand_id`
  3. `i_class_id`
  4. `i_category_id`
  5. `SUM(sales)`
  6. `SUM(number_sales)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
