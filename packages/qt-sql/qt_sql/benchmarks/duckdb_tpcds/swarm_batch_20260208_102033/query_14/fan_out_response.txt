WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_pushdown_and_materialization
EXAMPLES: pushdown, materialize_cte, early_filter
HINT: Focus on pushing date/item filters deeper into CTEs and materializing repeated subqueries to avoid redundant computation. Keep structure similar but reduce intermediate result sizes through early filtering.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_date_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel, dimension_cte_isolate
HINT: Isolate date filtering and dimension pre-filtering into reusable CTEs before joins. Share common dimension filters across sales channels to reduce redundant scanning.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_consolidation_prefetch
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Consolidate multiple sales table scans into single-pass CTEs with conditional aggregation. Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact data early to reduce join cardinality.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transforms
EXAMPLES: intersect_to_exists, decorrelate, or_to_union
HINT: Transform INTERSECT operations to EXISTS/JOIN patterns for better optimizer planning. Decorrelate subqueries and convert OR conditions to UNION ALL for selective execution.
