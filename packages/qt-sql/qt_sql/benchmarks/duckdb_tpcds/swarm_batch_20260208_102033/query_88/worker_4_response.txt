**Changes**: 
1. Created pre-filtered CTEs for `store` and `household_demographics` to reduce join sizes early
2. Created a unified `time_slices` CTE that categorizes all relevant time periods in a single scan
3. Combined all eight subqueries into a single pass over `store_sales` with conditional aggregation
4. Used explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control

**Expected speedup**: 3-4x. The rewrite eliminates 7 redundant scans of the large `store_sales` table and reduces the complex OR conditions to a single materialized CTE. The early filtering on dimension tables and single-pass aggregation should significantly reduce I/O and computation.
