WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply aggressive early filtering to dimension tables before joining, push predicates down into subqueries, and materialize repeated filter patterns into CTEs to avoid recomputation.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Isolate filtered dimension tables (store, household_demographics) and time ranges into separate CTEs before joining, enabling predicate pushdown and reusing shared dimension filters across time windows.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_single_pass_restructure
EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, multi_date_range_cte
HINT: Consolidate all time-window subqueries into a single CTE that scans store_sales once with conditional aggregation, prefetch filtered dimensions, and handle multiple time ranges in a unified structure.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, union_cte_split, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform OR conditions on household_demographics into UNION ALL branches for better index usage, split into specialized CTEs, and apply decorrelation techniques to restructure the entire query flow.
