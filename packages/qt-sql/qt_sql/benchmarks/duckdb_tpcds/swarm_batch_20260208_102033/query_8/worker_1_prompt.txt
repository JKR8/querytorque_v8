## Optimization Strategy: conservative_early_filter_pushdown

**Your approach**: Apply early filtering to dimension tables (date_dim, store) before joining with fact table; push static zip list filters into subqueries; materialize the complex zip derivation once.

**Focus**: Apply the examples below in service of this strategy. Prioritize this specific approach over generic optimizations.

You are a SQL query rewrite engine for DuckDB v1.4.3.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Derive eligible ZIP prefixes from an intersection subquery, join store sales/date/store, constrain to Q2 1998, match store ZIP prefixes to eligible customer ZIP prefixes, and sum net profit per store name.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~1k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [s_store_name, SUM(ss_net_profit)] — ordered by s_store_name ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim (join), store (join), customer_address (join), customer (join)
**Joins**: ss_store_sk = s_store_sk | ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_qoy = 2 | d_year = 1998 | (SUBSTRING(s_zip, 1, 2) = SUBSTRING(V1.ca_zip, 1, 2))
**Operators**: HASH_GROUP_BY, SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store]
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  s_store_name,
  SUM(ss_net_profit)
FROM store_sales, date_dim, store, (
  SELECT
    ca_zip
  FROM (
    SELECT
      SUBSTRING(ca_zip, 1, 5) AS ca_zip
    FROM customer_address
    WHERE
      SUBSTRING(ca_zip, 1, 5) IN (
        '47602',
        '16704',
        '35863',
        '28577',
        '83910',
        '36201',
        '58412',
        '48162',
...
```

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. early_filter (4.00x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: filter small dimension tables first, then join to large fact tables. This reduces the fact table scan to only rows matching the filter, rather than scanning all rows and filtering after the join.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select ss_customer_sk
            ,sum(act_sales) sumsales
      from (select ss_item_sk
                  ,ss_ticket_number

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

**Principle:** Scan Consolidation: when multiple subqueries scan the same table with similar patterns, consolidate them into CTEs that compute all needed aggregates in fewer passes. Reduces N scans to fewer scans.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql

### 3. materialize_cte (1.37x)

**Principle:** Shared Materialization: extract repeated subquery patterns into CTEs to avoid recomputation. When the same logical check appears multiple times, compute it once and reference the result.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
with ws_wh as
(select ws1.ws_order_number,ws1.ws_warehouse_sk wh1,ws2.ws_warehouse_sk wh2
 from web_sales ws1,web_sales ws2
 where ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number
   and ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
 select 
   count(distinct ws_order_number) as "order count"
  ,sum(ws_ext_ship_cost) as "total shipping cost"
  ,sum(ws_net_profit) as "total net profit"
from
   web_sales ws1
  ,date_dim
  ,customer_address
  ,web_site
where
    d_date between '1999-2-01' and 
           (cast('1999-2-01' as date) + INTERVAL 60 DAY)
and ws1.ws_ship_date_sk = d_date_sk
and ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
and ca_state = 'NC'
and ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
and web_company_name = 'pri'
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select ws_order_number
                            from ws_wh)
and ws1.ws_order_number in (select wr_order_number
                            from web_returns,ws_wh
                            where wr_order_number = ws_wh.ws_order_number)
order by count(distinct ws_order_number)
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[multi_warehouse_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ws_order_number FROM web_sales ws1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)
```
[returned_orders]:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT wr_order_number FROM web_returns
```
[main_query]:
```sql

```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (repeated for emphasis)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `s_store_name`
  2. `SUM(ss_net_profit)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentence summary of the rewrite>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your rewritten SQL:
