WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_filter_pushdown
EXAMPLES: early_filter, pushdown, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply safe predicate pushdown by filtering dimension tables first into CTEs, then join with fact tables to reduce data volume early in the pipeline.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: moderate_dimension_isolation
EXAMPLES: date_cte_isolate, dimension_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Isolate all dimension table filtering (date, item, store) into separate CTEs before joining with fact table, enabling independent optimization of each dimension.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_prefetch_restructuring
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with fact data in staged CTEs, then consolidate aggregations and defer window computations to minimize intermediate result sizes.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: novel_structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, union_cte_split, shared_dimension_multi_channel
HINT: Transform the complex OR condition on item categories/classes into UNION ALL branches with specialized CTEs, enabling better predicate pushdown and index usage.
