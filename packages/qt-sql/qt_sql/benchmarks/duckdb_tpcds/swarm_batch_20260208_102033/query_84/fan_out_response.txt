```
WORKER_1:
STRATEGY: conservative_early_reduction
EXAMPLES: pushdown, early_filter, materialize_cte
HINT: Apply filters to dimension tables first and push predicates down early; use CTE materialization for filtered dimension sets to reduce join sizes.

WORKER_2:
STRATEGY: dimension_isolation_restructure
EXAMPLES: dimension_cte_isolate, date_cte_isolate, multi_dimension_prefetch
HINT: Pre-filter and isolate all dimension tables into separate CTEs before joining with fact tables, enabling better predicate pushdown and join ordering.

WORKER_3:
STRATEGY: aggressive_fact_prefetch
EXAMPLES: prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation, deferred_window_aggregation
HINT: Pre-join filtered dimensions with fact tables early; consolidate multiple filtering passes into single CTEs with combined logic.

WORKER_4:
STRATEGY: structural_transform
EXAMPLES: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, composite_decorrelate_union
HINT: Transform query structure using set operation rewrites and decorrelation patterns, even if not directly present, to inspire alternative join approaches.
