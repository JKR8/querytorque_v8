You are analyzing 5 failed optimization attempts to design a refined approach that reaches 2.0x speedup.

Your job: understand WHY each attempt fell short, identify unexplored optimization angles, and synthesize a NEW strategy that combines the best insights while avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Query: query_36
## Target: 2.0x speedup
## Dialect: duckdb

```sql
-- start query 36 in stream 0 using template query36.tpl
select 
    sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) as gross_margin
   ,i_category
   ,i_class

   ,rank() over (
 	partition by grouping(i_category)+grouping(i_class),
 	case when grouping(i_class) = 0 then i_category end 
 	order by sum(ss_net_profit)/sum(ss_ext_sales_price) asc) as rank_within_parent

## Previous Attempts

### Worker 1: conservative_predicate_pushdown
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: early_filter, pushdown, date_cte_isolate
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim, store, item) into separate CTEs before the main join to reduce fact table rows early. Push filters into CTEs and use explicit joins.

```sql
WITH filtered_date AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_store AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
)
SELECT
    SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS gross_margin,
    i_category,
    i_class,
    GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class),
                     CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
        ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) ASC
    ) AS rank_within_parent
FROM store_sales
JOIN filtered_date ON d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
JOIN item ON i_item_sk = ss_item_sk
JOIN filtered_store ON s_store_sk = ss_store_sk
GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_category, i_class)
ORDER BY
    lochierarchy DESC,
    CASE WHEN lochierarchy = 0 THEN i_category END,
    rank_within_parent
LIMIT 100;
```

### Worker 2: moderate_dimension_isolation
- **Status**: pass (0.99x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: dimension_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, shared_dimension_multi_channel
- **Strategy hint**: Isolate all dimension filters into individual CTEs, then join with fact table. Materialize grouped aggregations before window function to simplify the final query.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_stores AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
),
filtered_items AS (
    SELECT i_item_sk, i_category, i_class
    FROM item
),
joined_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        i.i_category,
        i.i_class,
        ss.ss_net_profit,
        ss.ss_ext_sales_price
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_dates d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
    JOIN filtered_stores s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
    JOIN filtered_items i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
),
aggregated AS (
    SELECT 
        i_category,
        i_class,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS sum_net_profit,
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 3: aggressive_prefetch_restructure
- **Status**: pass (0.96x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: prefetch_fact_join, multi_dimension_prefetch, single_pass_aggregation
- **Strategy hint**: Pre-filter and pre-join dimensions with the fact table in staged CTEs. Consider consolidating the ROLLUP aggregation into a single-pass CTE before applying the window function.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_stores AS (
  SELECT s_store_sk
  FROM store
  WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')
),
joined_sales AS (
  SELECT
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    ss.ss_net_profit,
    ss.ss_ext_sales_price
  FROM store_sales ss
  JOIN filtered_dates d1 ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d1.d_date_sk
  JOIN filtered_stores s ON ss.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
  JOIN item i ON ss.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
),
aggregated AS (
  SELECT
    i_category,
    i_class,
    SUM(ss_net_profit) AS sum_net_profit,
    SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS sum_sales_price,
    GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy
  FROM joined_sales
  GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_category, i_class)
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 4: novel_structural_transform
- **Status**: pass (0.43x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: or_to_union, intersect_to_exists, union_cte_split
- **Strategy hint**: Transform the IN-list filter on s_state into UNION ALL branches for parallel filtering. Explore restructuring the ROLLUP logic with set operations to optimize aggregation paths.

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk
    FROM date_dim
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_stores AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk, s_state
    FROM store
    WHERE s_state IN ('SD', 'TN', 'GA', 'SC', 'MO', 'AL', 'MI', 'OH')

    SELECT
        i.i_category,
        i.i_class,
        ss.ss_net_profit,
        ss.ss_ext_sales_price
    FROM store_sales ss
    JOIN filtered_dates d ON d.d_date_sk = ss.ss_sold_date_sk
    JOIN item i ON i.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk
    JOIN filtered_stores s ON s.s_store_sk = ss.ss_store_sk
),
level_aggregates AS (
    -- Level 0: category + class
    SELECT
        i_category,
        i_class,
        0 AS lochierarchy,
        SUM(ss_net_profit) AS sum_net_profit,
        SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) AS sum_sales_price
    FROM joined_base
-- ... (truncated)
```

### Worker 5: refined_snipe
- **Status**: pass (1.05x)
- **Transforms**: none
- **Examples used**: 
- **Strategy hint**: Snipe from iter 1

```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
    SELECT d_date_sk 
    FROM date_dim 
    WHERE d_year = 2002
),
filtered_stores AS (
    SELECT s_store_sk

    i_category,
    i_class,
    GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class) AS lochierarchy,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY GROUPING(i_category) + GROUPING(i_class), 
                     CASE WHEN GROUPING(i_class) = 0 THEN i_category END
        ORDER BY SUM(ss_net_profit) / SUM(ss_ext_sales_price) ASC

## Your Task

Analyze the failed attempts and design a refined approach:

1. **Failure Analysis**: Why did all attempts fall short? Be specific about mechanisms.
2. **Common Patterns**: What did multiple workers try unsuccessfully?
3. **Unexplored Space**: What optimization angles were missed entirely?
4. **Refined Strategy**: Synthesize a NEW approach combining best insights.
