```sql
WITH filtered_reason AS (
    SELECT r_reason_sk
    FROM reason
    WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
), filtered_returns AS (
    SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity
    FROM store_returns
    JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
)
SELECT
    ss_customer_sk,
    SUM(
        CASE
            WHEN NOT sr_return_quantity IS NULL
            THEN (ss_quantity - sr_return_quantity) * ss_sales_price
            ELSE ss_quantity * ss_sales_price
        END
    ) AS sumsales
FROM store_sales
LEFT OUTER JOIN filtered_returns ON (
    sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk 
    AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number
)
GROUP BY ss_customer_sk
ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk
LIMIT 100
```

Changes: Applied early_filter pattern: isolated the small dimension table (reason) first, then filtered store_returns by the reason key before joining to the large fact table (store_sales). This reduces the store_returns scan to only relevant rows and avoids scanning all store_sales rows during the reason filter.

Expected speedup: ~4.0x (based on early_filter example showing similar transformation)
