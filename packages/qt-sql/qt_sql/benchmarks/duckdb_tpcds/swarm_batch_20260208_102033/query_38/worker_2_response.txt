Changes: Isolated the filtered date_dim table into a CTE that materializes once, allowing reuse across all three sales channel subqueries. Also converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for clarity and better optimization.

Expected speedup: 1.3-1.8x by avoiding redundant date_dim scans and building a small hash table for the filtered dates.
