**Changes**: 
1. Created a CTE (`filtered_date`) to materialize the date range filter once, reducing repeated computation.
2. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer control.
3. Pushed the date filter into the CTE to filter the dimension table early before joining with large fact tables.

**Expected speedup**: 1.3–1.8x from eliminating redundant date_dim scans and allowing earlier filtering.
