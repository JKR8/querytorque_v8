**Changes**: Restructured the query into a multi-CTE pipeline that prefilters the date dimension once, then performs separate distinct joins for each sales channel, preserving the original INTERSECT logic.

**Expected speedup**: 1.5-2x by isolating the date filter into a CTE and enabling parallel execution of channel-specific joins while reducing repeated date_dim scans.
