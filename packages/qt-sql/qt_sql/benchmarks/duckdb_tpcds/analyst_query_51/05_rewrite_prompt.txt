You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**web_v1**: Computes running cumulative sales by item and date for web sales over a 12-month period. Scans web_sales (fact table) joined with date_dim (dimension), filters to 12 months of data. Outputs ~1k rows with (item_sk, d_date, cume_sales).

**store_v1**: Identical computation for store sales over same 12-month period. Scans store_sales joined with date_dim. Outputs ~1k rows with same schema.

**main_query**: Performs full outer join between web_v1 and store_v1 on (item_sk, d_date), then computes running maximums of both sales streams (which are redundant since inputs are already cumulative), filters where web cumulative exceeds store cumulative, orders, and limits to 100 rows. Processes ~1k rows from the join.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost mechanism is **redundant window function computation** combined with **inefficient join pattern**:

1. **Redundant window operations**: Both CTEs compute `SUM(SUM(...)) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date)` - a cumulative sum. Then the main query computes `MAX(...) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date)` on these already cumulative values. Since cumulative values are non-decreasing by definition, the running maximum equals the current value, making this window function unnecessary.

2. **Inefficient full outer join**: The FULL OUTER JOIN produces NULL rows for dates where only one channel has sales, but these are later filtered out by `web_cumulative > store_cumulative` (NULL comparisons yield NULL/false). This wastes compute on rows that won't survive the filter.

3. **Multiple scans of date_dim**: Both CTEs independently scan and filter the same 12-month range from date_dim, potentially duplicating work.

The cost distribution (33% each for CTEs, 33% for main) suggests the main query is disproportionately expensive given it only processes ~1k rows - indicating the window functions in the main query are the bottleneck.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Eliminate redundant window functions in main query**
- **What**: Replace the `MAX(...) OVER (...)` window functions with direct references to web_sales and store_sales, since they're already cumulative.
- **Why**: Eliminates unnecessary sorting/partitioning of ~1k rows. The running max of a cumulative value equals the current value.
- **Risk**: Must verify cumulative values are truly non-decreasing (they are by SQL's `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY d_date ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING)`).
- **Estimated impact**: Significant (removes ~33% of query cost).

**Change 2: Convert FULL OUTER JOIN to INNER JOIN**
- **What**: Change `FULL OUTER JOIN` to `INNER JOIN` since `web_cumulative > store_cumulative` filter removes NULL rows.
- **Why**: Reduces join complexity and avoids generating rows that will be filtered out.
- **Risk**: Must ensure semantics are identical - NULL comparisons yield NULL, which fails the filter, so INNER JOIN is equivalent.
- **Estimated impact**: Moderate (reduces join output size).

**Change 3: Share date_dim filtering via CTE**
- **What**: Extract `SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216+11` into a CTE and reference it in both web_v1 and store_v1.
- **Why**: Avoids scanning/filtering date_dim twice. DuckDB may not automatically cache this.
- **Risk**: Could interfere with join ordering optimizations (as seen in previous failure).
- **Estimated impact**: Minor to moderate.

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Previous attempt: date_cte_isolate (REGRESSION 0.87x)**
- **Why it failed**: Likely because DuckDB's optimizer already pushes the date filter efficiently, and materializing the date subset into a CTE prevented join reordering or introduced unnecessary materialization overhead.
- **Lesson**: DuckDB may optimize dimension table joins better when left inline. Explicit CTEs for small dimension tables can inhibit optimizations.

### Recommended Approach
Implement optimizations 1 and 2 together, as they're semantically safe and synergistic:
1. Rewrite the main query to use direct column references instead of window functions
2. Change FULL OUTER JOIN to INNER JOIN
3. Keep date_dim joins inline (don't extract to CTE) based on previous failure

Resulting query structure:
```sql
WITH web_v1 AS (...),  -- unchanged
     store_v1 AS (...)  -- unchanged
SELECT
  COALESCE(web.item_sk, store.item_sk) AS item_sk,
  COALESCE(web.d_date, store.d_date) AS d_date,
  web.cume_sales AS web_sales,
  store.cume_sales AS store_sales,
  web.cume_sales AS web_cumulative,      -- Direct reference, not window
  store.cume_sales AS store_cumulative   -- Direct reference, not window
FROM web_v1 AS web
INNER JOIN store_v1 AS store            -- Changed from FULL OUTER
  ON web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date
WHERE web.cume_sales > store.cume_sales
ORDER BY item_sk, d_date
LIMIT 100
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

The FAISS selections are partially relevant:
- **deferred_window_aggregation**: Relevant for eliminating redundant windows
- **early_filter**: Relevant but previous failure suggests caution
- **shared_dimension_multi_channel**: Relevant for sharing date_dim

Better examples for this query:
- **pushdown**: For pushing the cumulative comparison into the join
- **deferred_window_aggregation**: For eliminating redundant window computations
- **materialize_cte**: Though previous failure suggests avoiding date CTE

EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, pushdown, materialize_cte

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
WITH web_v1 as (
select
  ws_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ws_sales_price))
      over (partition by ws_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from web_sales
    ,date_dim
where ws_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ws_item_sk is not NULL
group by ws_item_sk, d_date),
store_v1 as (
select
  ss_item_sk item_sk, d_date,
  sum(sum(ss_sales_price))
      over (partition by ss_item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) cume_sales
from store_sales
    ,date_dim
where ss_sold_date_sk=d_date_sk
  and d_month_seq between 1216 and 1216+11
  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** When CTEs compute GROUP BY + WINDOW (running sum), then FULL OUTER JOIN introduces NULLs requiring a MAX() OVER() carry-forward pass: remove WINDOW from the CTEs (keep only GROUP BY for daily totals), join the daily totals, then compute SUM() OVER() once on the joined result. SUM() naturally skips NULLs, so the carry-forward is free. Reduces 3 WINDOW passes (2 in CTEs + 1 MAX carry-forward) to 1.

**AFTER (fast):**
[web_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM web_sales, date_dim WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
```

### 2. pushdown (2.11x)

            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)

```

**Key insight:** Extract repeated quantity-range subqueries into CTEs. Each CTE computes count, avg_ext_price, avg_net_profit in ONE pass instead of scanning store_sales 15+ times.

**AFTER (fast):**

```

**Key insight:** Extract the EXISTS subquery into a CTE that finds multi-warehouse orders ONCE. Extract returned orders into another CTE. Join instead of nested EXISTS checks.

**AFTER (fast):**
[multi_warehouse_orders]:

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.
