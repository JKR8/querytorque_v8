You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate store sales quantity*price under a multi-level ROLLUP, compute rank by descending sumsales within each category, and retain rows with rank <= 100.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~5.4M rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [*] — ordered by i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_brand ASC, i_product_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, d_moy ASC, s_store_id ASC, sumsales ASC, rk ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim, store, item
**Filters**: rk <= 100
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store], SEQ_SCAN[item], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT
    i_category,
    i_class,
    i_brand,
    i_product_name,
    d_year,
    d_qoy,
    d_moy,
    s_store_id,
    sumsales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
  FROM (
    SELECT
      i_category,
      i_class,
      i_brand,
      i_product_name,

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**Innermost Subquery (dw1)**:
- Computes aggregated sales (price × quantity) for 12 consecutive months, grouped by 8 dimensions with ROLLUP (producing subtotals at all hierarchy levels).
- Reads all ~5.4M store_sales rows filtered through date_dim (12 months = ~360 days), then joins with store (~1,000 rows) and item (~400K rows).
- Outputs ~X rows (base groups + rollup subtotals) where X = (#item categories × classes × brands × products × years × quarters × months × stores × rollup combinations).

**Middle Subquery (dw2)**:
- Ranks each row within its category by descending sales, including all ROLLUP-generated subtotal rows in the ranking.
- Processes the entire output from dw1.
- Outputs same row count as dw1 plus rank column.

**Outermost Query**:
- Filters to top 100 ranks per category, then sorts by all 8 dimensions plus sales and rank.
- Processes ~(100 × #categories) rows before LIMIT 100.
- Final output: 100 rows of top-performing combinations per category.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost is the **SEQ_SCAN of store_sales (5.4M rows) with immediate ROLLUP aggregation**. The mechanism is:

1. **Unnecessary ROLLUP computation**: The query computes expensive ROLLUP (256 grouping sets) for ALL data, then filters to top 100 per category. 95%+ of these rollup aggregations are discarded.
2. **Late filtering**: The date filter (`d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206+11`) applies during the join, but DuckDB must still scan the entire store_sales table to find matching rows.
3. **Window function on large intermediate**: RANK() processes the entire rollup result, including subtotal rows that may not be needed.

The root cause: **computing expensive ROLLUP before top-N filtering**. Each rollup level multiplies aggregation work, yet only a tiny fraction (top 100 per category) is needed.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Optimization 1: Pre-filter fact table with dimension CTEs**
- **What**: Create CTEs for filtered date_dim, store, item; join them with store_sales using fact table last.
- **Why**: Reduces store_sales scan via selective joins. DuckDB can push predicates and use efficient join orders.
- **Risk**: Must preserve all rollup combinations. Ensure no cartesian products.
- **Impact**: Moderate (2-3x expected based on pattern history).

**Optimization 2: Defer ROLLUP until after top-N filtering**
- **What**: First compute non-rollup aggregates, rank them, filter to top 100 per category, THEN compute ROLLUP only for those groups.
- **Why**: Avoids computing 256 grouping sets for all data; only computes rollup for top performers.
- **Risk**: Changes semantics if subtotal rows (NULLs in grouping columns) could rank in top 100. Need business validation.
- **Impact**: Significant (3-5x) if rollup computation is dominant.

**Optimization 3: Materialize dimension-filtered fact rows**
- **What**: Create CTE with store_sales pre-joined with filtered date_dim only (key + date columns), then join with other dimensions.
- **Why**: Enables early fact table reduction via date filter pushdown.
- **Risk**: May interfere with DuckDB's join optimizer; test with/without CTE materialization hints.
- **Impact**: Minor to moderate (1.5-2x).

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Previous attempt: date_cte_isolate (0.85x regression)**
- **Why it failed**: DuckDB's optimizer already pushes date filters effectively. The CTE added materialization overhead without providing new optimization opportunities. The real bottleneck was ROLLUP computation, not date filtering.
- **Lesson**: Isolating a single dimension filter won't help when the dominant cost is massive aggregation. Need to address the ROLLUP mechanism directly.

### Recommended Approach
Implement **deferred ROLLUP with prefetch join**:

1. **Create dimension-filtered CTEs** for date_dim (month range), store (all), item (all).
2. **Join CTEs with store_sales** in optimal order: date → store_sales → item → store.
3. **Compute base aggregates** (GROUP BY all 8 columns, NO ROLLUP).
4. **Apply window function** (RANK) on this smaller result.
5. **Filter to top 100 per category** (rk <= 100).
6. **Compute ROLLUP only on the filtered result** (now ~few hundred rows).

This approach:
- Eliminates 99% of ROLLUP computations
- Reduces window function input size dramatically
- Preserves semantics if business accepts that only fully-specified groups (not subtotals) compete for top ranks

Implementation sketch:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy 
  FROM date_dim 
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206 + 11
),
joined_data AS (
  SELECT 
    i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
    d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id,
    SUM(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity) AS sumsales
  FROM store_sales
  JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN item ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
  JOIN store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  GROUP BY i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
           d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk
  FROM joined_data
)
SELECT *
FROM (
  -- Now apply ROLLUP only to top performers
  SELECT 
    i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
    d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id,
    SUM(sumsales) AS sumsales,
    MIN(rk) AS rk  -- preserve original rank
  FROM ranked
  WHERE rk <= 100
  GROUP BY ROLLUP(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
                  d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)
) 
ORDER BY i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name,
         d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id,
         sumsales, rk
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

The FAISS picks are partially relevant:
- `deferred_window_aggregation`: Relevant for moving RANK after filtering, but we also need ROLLUP deferral.
- `prefetch_fact_join`: Relevant for dimension pre-filtering.
- `decorrelate`: Not directly applicable (no correlated subqueries).

Better examples for this query:
- `single_pass_aggregation`: Because we're consolidating ROLLUP computation.
- `dimension_cte_isolate`: For pre-filtering all dimensions.
- `prefetch_fact_join`: For forcing optimal join order.

**EXAMPLES: single_pass_aggregation, dimension_cte_isolate, prefetch_fact_join**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select case when (select count(*) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) > 2972190
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price) 
                  from store_sales 
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 1 and 20) end bucket1 ,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) > 4505785
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) 
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 21 and 40) end bucket2,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) > 1575726
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 41 and 60) end bucket3,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) > 3188917
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 61 and 80) end bucket4,
       case when (select count(*)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) > 3525216
            then (select avg(ss_ext_sales_price)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100)
            else (select avg(ss_net_profit)
                  from store_sales
                  where ss_quantity between 81 and 100) end bucket5
from reason
where r_reason_sk = 1;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[store_sales_aggregates]:
```sql
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc1, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 1 AND 20 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid1, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc2, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 21 AND 40 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid2, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc3, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 41 AND 60 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid3, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc4, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 61 AND 80 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid4, SUM(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cnt5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_ext_discount_amt END) AS avg_disc5, AVG(CASE WHEN ss_quantity BETWEEN 81 AND 100 THEN ss_net_paid END) AS avg_paid5 FROM store_sales
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN cnt1 > 74129 THEN avg_disc1 ELSE avg_paid1 END AS bucket1, CASE WHEN cnt2 > 122840 THEN avg_disc2 ELSE avg_paid2 END AS bucket2, CASE WHEN cnt3 > 56580 THEN avg_disc3 ELSE avg_paid3 END AS bucket3, CASE WHEN cnt4 > 10097 THEN avg_disc4 ELSE avg_paid4 END AS bucket4, CASE WHEN cnt5 > 165306 THEN avg_disc5 ELSE avg_paid5 END AS bucket5 FROM store_sales_aggregates
```

### 2. dimension_cte_isolate (1.93x)

**Principle:** Early Selection: pre-filter dimension tables into CTEs returning only surrogate keys before joining with fact tables. Each dimension CTE is tiny, creating small hash tables that speed up the fact table probe.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select i_item_id, 
        avg(cs_quantity) agg1,
        avg(cs_list_price) agg2,
        avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3,
        avg(cs_sales_price) agg4 
 from catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
 where cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk and
       cs_item_sk = i_item_sk and
       cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk and
       cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk and
       cd_gender = 'M' and 
       cd_marital_status = 'S' and
       cd_education_status = 'Unknown' and
       (p_channel_email = 'N' or p_channel_event = 'N') and
       d_year = 2001 
 group by i_item_id
 order by i_item_id
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000
```
[filtered_customer_demographics]:
```sql
SELECT cd_demo_sk FROM customer_demographics WHERE cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
```
[filtered_promotions]:
```sql
SELECT p_promo_sk FROM promotion WHERE p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N'
```
[joined_facts]:
```sql
SELECT cs_item_sk, cs_quantity, cs_list_price, cs_coupon_amt, cs_sales_price FROM catalog_sales AS cs JOIN filtered_dates AS fd ON cs.cs_sold_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk JOIN filtered_customer_demographics AS fcd ON cs.cs_bill_cdemo_sk = fcd.cd_demo_sk JOIN filtered_promotions AS fp ON cs.cs_promo_sk = fp.p_promo_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT i_item_id, AVG(cs_quantity) AS agg1, AVG(cs_list_price) AS agg2, AVG(cs_coupon_amt) AS agg3, AVG(cs_sales_price) AS agg4 FROM joined_facts AS jf JOIN item AS i ON jf.cs_item_sk = i.i_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100
```

## Regression Warnings

The following rewrites were attempted on **structurally similar queries**
and caused **performance regressions**. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: regression_q67_date_cte_isolate (0.85x — REGRESSION)
**Query:** q67 | **Transform attempted:** date_cte_isolate

**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize dimension filters into CTEs before complex aggregations (ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS) with window functions. The optimizer needs to push aggregation through joins; CTEs create materialization barriers.

          and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
          and d_month_seq between 1206 and 1206+11
       group by  rollup(i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy,s_store_id))dw1) dw2

```

**Regressed rewrite (DO NOT replicate this pattern):**
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206 + 11), filtered_stores AS (SELECT s_store_sk, s_store_id FROM store), filtered_items AS (SELECT i_item_sk, i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name FROM item)
SELECT * FROM (SELECT i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS rk FROM (SELECT i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, SUM(COALESCE(ss_sales_price * ss_quantity, 0)) AS sumsales FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk JOIN filtered_stores ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk JOIN filtered_items ON ss_item_sk = i_item_sk GROUP BY ROLLUP (i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id)) AS dw1) AS dw2 WHERE rk <= 100 ORDER BY i_category, i_class, i_brand, i_product_name, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy, s_store_id, sumsales, rk LIMIT 100
```

**Why it regressed:** Materialized date, store, and item dimension filters into CTEs before a ROLLUP aggregation with window functions (RANK() OVER). CTE materialization prevents the optimizer from pushing the ROLLUP and window computation down through the join tree, forcing a full materialized intermediate before the expensive aggregation.

### Warning 2: regression_q51_date_cte_isolate (0.87x — REGRESSION)
**Query:** q51 | **Transform attempted:** date_cte_isolate

**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering together.

**Regressed rewrite (DO NOT replicate this pattern):**
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk, d_date FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11), filtered_web_sales AS (SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, ws_sales_price FROM web_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE NOT ws_item_sk IS NULL), filtered_store_sales AS (SELECT ss_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, ss_sales_price FROM store_sales JOIN filtered_dates ON ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk WHERE NOT ss_item_sk IS NULL), web_v1 AS (SELECT item_sk, d_date, SUM(SUM(ws_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales FROM filtered_web_sales GROUP BY item_sk, d_date), store_v1 AS (SELECT item_sk, d_date, SUM(SUM(ss_sales_price)) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS cume_sales FROM filtered_store_sales GROUP BY item_sk, d_date)
SELECT * FROM (SELECT item_sk, d_date, web_sales, store_sales, MAX(web_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS web_cumulative, MAX(store_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY item_sk ORDER BY d_date rows BETWEEN UNBOUNDED preceding AND CURRENT ROW) AS store_cumulative FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN NOT web.item_sk IS NULL THEN web.item_sk ELSE store.item_sk END AS item_sk, CASE WHEN NOT web.d_date IS NULL THEN web.d_date ELSE store.d_date END AS d_date, web.cume_sales AS web_sales, store.cume_sales AS store_sales FROM web_v1 AS web FULL OUTER JOIN store_v1 AS store ON (web.item_sk = store.item_sk AND web.d_date = store.d_date)) AS x) AS y WHERE web_cumulative > store_cumulative ORDER BY item_sk, d_date LIMIT 100
```

**Why it regressed:** Materialized cumulative window functions (SUM() OVER ORDER BY) into separate CTEs (web_v1, store_v1) before a FULL OUTER JOIN that filters on web_cumulative > store_cumulative. The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
```

After the SQL, briefly explain what you changed:
