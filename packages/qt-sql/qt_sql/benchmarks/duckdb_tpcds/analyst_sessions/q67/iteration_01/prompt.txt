You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 0)
**Intent**: Aggregate store sales quantity*price under a multi-level ROLLUP, compute rank by descending sumsales within each category, and retain rows with rank <= 100.
**Stats**: 100% Cost | ~5.4M rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [*] — ordered by i_category ASC, i_class ASC, i_brand ASC, i_product_name ASC, d_year ASC, d_qoy ASC, d_moy ASC, s_store_id ASC, sumsales ASC, rk ASC
**Dependencies**: store_sales, date_dim, store, item
**Filters**: rk <= 100
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_sales], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], SEQ_SCAN[store], SEQ_SCAN[item], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM (
  SELECT

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**Inner-most subquery (dw1)**: 
- Joins `store_sales` (~5.4M rows) with filtered `date_dim` (12 months), `item`, and `store`
- Computes sales sums (`ss_sales_price * ss_quantity`) with `ROLLUP` on 8 dimensions (category through store_id)
- Output: Aggregated rows including rollup subtotals - cardinality likely in tens of thousands

**Middle subquery (dw2)**:
- Takes aggregated results and computes `RANK()` within each `i_category` partition ordered by `sumsales DESC`
- Output: Same cardinality as dw1 plus rank column

**Outer query**:
- Filters to top 100 ranks per category, orders by all dimensions, limits to 100
- Output: Exactly 100 rows

### Performance Bottleneck
**Primary bottleneck**: The `GROUP BY ROLLUP` on 8 dimensions after joining the entire fact table.

**Mechanism**: 
1. The query scans `store_sales` (~5.4M rows) and joins with all dimension tables BEFORE aggregation
2. The 8-dimension `ROLLUP` generates a massive number of aggregation combinations (2^8 = 256 possible grouping sets per base row)
3. The window function `RANK()` must sort the entire aggregated result set by `i_category, sumsales DESC`

**Key insight**: The final output only needs top 100 per category, but we compute ALL aggregations first, then rank, then filter. This is wasteful.

**Secondary issue**: The `ROLLUP` creates subtotal rows that get ranked along with detailed rows, but the outer filter `rk <= 100` might exclude many subtotals early.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
### Change 1: Push rank filter inside aggregation (significant impact)
**What**: Compute rank on detailed rows (without rollup), filter to top 100 per category, THEN compute rollup
**Why**: Reduces the input to `ROLLUP` from all combinations to only top-performing items per category
**Risk**: Rollup subtotals will only include top 100 items per category, not all items
**Impact**: Significant (10-100x reduction in rows to aggregate)

### Change 2: Pre-filter dates and pre-join with store_sales (moderate impact)
**What**: Create CTE with filtered dates, join to store_sales first to reduce fact table rows early
**Why**: Reduces the fact table scan by applying date filter early via efficient hash join
**Risk**: Must preserve all date columns needed for grouping (d_year, d_qoy, d_moy)
**Impact**: Moderate (reduces fact table rows by ~12x)

### Change 3: Separate detailed vs. rollup ranking (minor impact)
**What**: Compute ranks separately for detailed rows and handle rollup rows differently
**Why**: Avoids ranking rollup subtotals against detailed rows (semantic issue)
**Risk**: Complex to implement correctly
**Impact**: Minor (cleaner semantics)

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Attempt 2 (decorrelate, materialize_cte)** failed because:
- **Root cause**: Misplaced `ROLLUP` - moved it to AFTER ranking instead of BEFORE
- **Semantic error**: The rewrite aggregated ranked results instead of ranking aggregated results
- **Lesson**: `ROLLUP` must happen before `RANK()` since ranking depends on aggregated sums

**Attempt 1 (date_cte_isolate)** showed regression (0.85x) because:
- **Root cause**: DuckDB may not push the CTE filter effectively into the join
- **Lesson**: Simple CTE isolation without aggressive pushdown may not help in DuckDB

### Recommended Approach
**Primary strategy**: **deferred_window_aggregation** pattern
1. Pre-filter dates into CTE, join with store_sales early to reduce fact scan
2. Compute detailed aggregations (without ROLLUP)
3. Rank detailed rows and filter to top 100 per category
4. Apply ROLLUP only to the filtered top performers
5. Final ranking on rolled-up results (if needed)

**Implementation sketch**:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (
  SELECT d_date_sk, d_year, d_qoy, d_moy
  FROM date_dim
  WHERE d_month_seq BETWEEN 1206 AND 1206 + 11
),
fact_with_dates AS (
  SELECT ss.*, d.d_year, d.d_qoy, d.d_moy
  FROM store_sales ss
  JOIN filtered_dates d ON ss.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
),
detailed_sales AS (
  SELECT
    i.i_category,
    i.i_class,
    i.i_brand,
    i.i_product_name,
    f.d_year,
    f.d_qoy,
    f.d_moy,
    s.s_store_id,
    SUM(f.ss_sales_price * f.ss_quantity) AS sumsales
  FROM fact_with_dates f
  JOIN item i ON f.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  JOIN store s ON f.ss_store_sk = s.s_store_sk
  GROUP BY i.i_category, i.i_class, i.i_brand, i.i_product_name,
           f.d_year, f.d_qoy, f.d_moy, s.s_store_id
),
ranked_details AS (
  SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i_category ORDER BY sumsales DESC) AS detail_rk
  FROM detailed_sales
),
top_details AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM ranked_details
  WHERE detail_rk <= 100
)
-- Then apply ROLLUP to top_details and final ranking
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

**FAISS picks**: `deferred_window_aggregation`, `prefetch_fact_join`, `decorrelate`

**Assessment**: Good picks, but missing `single_pass_aggregation` which is crucial here since we're scanning store_sales multiple times in the original.

**Better examples**: 
- `deferred_window_aggregation` - Core pattern (rank before expensive operations)
- `prefetch_fact_join` - For early date filtering
- `single_pass_aggregation` - Critical to avoid rescanning store_sales

```
EXAMPLES: deferred_window_aggregation, prefetch_fact_join, single_pass_aggregation
```

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Reference Examples

The following examples are for **pattern reference only**. Do not copy their table names, column names, or literal values into your rewrite. Use only the schema and tables from the target query above.

### 1. deferred_window_aggregation (1.36x)

**Principle:** Deferred Aggregation: delay expensive operations (window functions) until after joins reduce the dataset. Computing window functions inside individual CTEs then joining is more expensive than joining first and computing windows once on the combined result.

  and ss_item_sk is not NULL
group by ss_item_sk, d_date)
 select *
from (select item_sk
     ,d_date
     ,web_sales
     ,store_sales
     ,max(web_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) web_cumulative
     ,max(store_sales)
         over (partition by item_sk order by d_date rows between unbounded preceding and current row) store_cumulative
     from (select case when web.item_sk is not null then web.item_sk else store.item_sk end item_sk
                 ,case when web.d_date is not null then web.d_date else store.d_date end d_date
                 ,web.cume_sales web_sales
                 ,store.cume_sales store_sales
           from web_v1 web full outer join store_v1 store on (web.item_sk = store.item_sk
                                                          and web.d_date = store.d_date)
          )x )y
where web_cumulative > store_cumulative
order by item_sk
        ,d_date
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[web_daily]:
```sql
SELECT ws_item_sk AS item_sk, d_date, SUM(ws_sales_price) AS daily_sales FROM web_sales, date_dim WHERE ws_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_month_seq BETWEEN 1216 AND 1216 + 11 AND ws_item_sk IS NOT NULL GROUP BY ws_item_sk, d_date
```

```

### 2. prefetch_fact_join (3.77x)

**Principle:** Staged Join Pipeline: build a CTE chain that progressively reduces data — first CTE filters the dimension, second CTE pre-joins filtered dimension keys with the fact table, subsequent CTEs join remaining dimensions against the already-reduced fact set.

**BEFORE (slow):**
```sql
select * 
from (select i_manager_id
             ,sum(ss_sales_price) sum_sales
             ,avg(sum(ss_sales_price)) over (partition by i_manager_id) avg_monthly_sales
      from item
          ,store_sales
          ,date_dim
          ,store
      where ss_item_sk = i_item_sk
        and ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk
        and ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
        and d_month_seq in (1181,1181+1,1181+2,1181+3,1181+4,1181+5,1181+6,1181+7,1181+8,1181+9,1181+10,1181+11)
        and ((    i_category in ('Books','Children','Electronics')
              and i_class in ('personal','portable','reference','self-help')
              and i_brand in ('scholaramalgamalg #14','scholaramalgamalg #7',
		                  'exportiunivamalg #9','scholaramalgamalg #9'))
           or(    i_category in ('Women','Music','Men')
              and i_class in ('accessories','classical','fragrances','pants')
              and i_brand in ('amalgimporto #1','edu packscholar #1','exportiimporto #1',
		                 'importoamalg #1')))
group by i_manager_id, d_moy) tmp1
where case when avg_monthly_sales > 0 then abs (sum_sales - avg_monthly_sales) / avg_monthly_sales else null end > 0.1
order by i_manager_id
        ,avg_monthly_sales
        ,sum_sales
 LIMIT 100;
```

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_dates]:
```sql
SELECT d_date_sk, d_moy FROM date_dim WHERE d_month_seq IN (1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205, 1206, 1207, 1208, 1209, 1210, 1211)
```
[filtered_sales]:
```sql

```

### 3. single_pass_aggregation (4.47x)

**Principle:** Single-Pass Aggregation: consolidate multiple scalar subqueries on the same table into one CTE using CASE expressions inside aggregate functions. Reduces N separate table scans to 1 pass.

**BEFORE (slow):**

## Regression Warnings

The following rewrites were attempted on **structurally similar queries**
and caused **performance regressions**. Do NOT repeat these patterns.

### Warning 1: regression_q67_date_cte_isolate (0.85x — REGRESSION)
**Query:** q67 | **Transform attempted:** date_cte_isolate

**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize dimension filters into CTEs before complex aggregations (ROLLUP, CUBE, GROUPING SETS) with window functions. The optimizer needs to push aggregation through joins; CTEs create materialization barriers.

```

**Why it regressed:** Materialized date, store, and item dimension filters into CTEs before a ROLLUP aggregation with window functions (RANK() OVER). CTE materialization prevents the optimizer from pushing the ROLLUP and window computation down through the join tree, forcing a full materialized intermediate before the expensive aggregation.

### Warning 2: regression_q51_date_cte_isolate (0.87x — REGRESSION)
**Query:** q51 | **Transform attempted:** date_cte_isolate

**Anti-pattern:** Do not materialize running/cumulative window aggregates into CTEs before joins that filter based on those aggregates. The optimizer can co-optimize window evaluation and join filtering together.

```

**Why it regressed:** Materialized cumulative window functions (SUM() OVER ORDER BY) into separate CTEs (web_v1, store_v1) before a FULL OUTER JOIN that filters on web_cumulative > store_cumulative. The original evaluates windows lazily during the join, co-optimizing window computation with the join filter. Materialization forces full window computation before filtering.


## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

## Output

Return the complete rewritten SQL query. The query must be syntactically
valid and ready to execute.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your rewritten query MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

```sql
-- Your rewritten query here
