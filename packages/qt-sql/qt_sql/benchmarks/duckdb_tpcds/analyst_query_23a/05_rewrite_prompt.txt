You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**frequent_ss_items**: Finds store-sold items that sold >4 times on any single day during 2000-2003. Scans store_sales (large), joins with date_dim (filtered by year) and item. Outputs ~1k rows (item_sk, date).

**max_store_sales**: Calculates the maximum total sales per customer during 2000-2003. Scans store_sales (large), joins with date_dim (filtered) and customer. Outputs a single scalar value.

**best_ss_customer**: Finds customers whose lifetime total store sales exceed 95% of the max from previous CTE. Scans entire store_sales (unfiltered) and customer. Outputs ~1k customer_sk.

**main_query**: Sums May 2000 sales from catalog_sales and web_sales, filtered to items from frequent_ss_items and customers from best_ss_customer. Scans two large fact tables with date filter and two IN subqueries. Outputs single sum.

### Performance Bottleneck
**Primary bottleneck: Redundant full scans of store_sales.** The same 100M+ row table is scanned three times with different grouping patterns:
1. **frequent_ss_items**: Scan with date filter, group by item+date
2. **max_store_sales**: Scan with date filter, group by customer  
3. **best_ss_customer**: Scan without date filter, group by customer

**Secondary bottleneck: IN subqueries in main query.** Each channel (catalog/web) executes two correlated IN subqueries against CTE results, potentially forcing nested-loop joins instead of efficient hash joins.

**Root mechanism**: Store_sales is scanned multiple times for overlapping computations (2000-2003 period appears in first two scans). The best_ss_customer scan is particularly expensive as it processes the entire historical table when only customers from 2000-2003 matter for the final result.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
**Change 1: Merge frequent_ss_items and max_store_sales into single store_sales scan**
- **What**: Create single CTE scanning store_sales once for 2000-2003, computing both item-date counts AND per-customer sales.
- **Why**: Eliminates duplicate 100M+ row scan of same date-filtered store_sales. Both CTEs filter by identical d_year range.
- **Risk**: Must preserve HAVING COUNT(*) > 4 logic and ensure per-customer sums use same date filter.
- **Impact**: Significant (reduces store_sales scans from 3→2).

**Change 2: Pre-filter best_ss_customer using 2000-2003 customers only**
- **What**: Restrict best_ss_customer to customers who actually purchased during 2000-2003, before computing lifetime total.
- **Why**: The HAVING clause compares to max from 2000-2003, so customers with no 2000-2003 sales cannot qualify. Avoids scanning entire store_sales for irrelevant customers.
- **Risk**: Must verify semantic correctness - original query includes all customers in store_sales.
- **Impact**: Moderate to significant (reduces best_ss_customer build side).

**Change 3: Convert IN subqueries to JOINs with pre-materialized CTEs**
- **What**: Extract DISTINCT item_sk from frequent_ss_items and c_customer_sk from best_ss_customer, then JOIN instead of IN.
- **Why**: Allows optimizer to use hash joins instead of potentially nested-loop execution. DuckDB can better optimize join ordering.
- **Risk**: Must ensure no duplicate rows from CTEs (use DISTINCT).
- **Impact**: Moderate (improves main query join strategy).

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

**Key insight:** When multiple CTEs (store/catalog/web channels) apply identical dimension filters (same date range, same item price threshold, same promotion filter), extract those filters into shared dimension CTEs and pre-join them with each fact table. This eliminates redundant dimension scans. Note: only pre-join channels where the join is straightforward. If one channel (e.g., catalog) has a more complex join structure, leave it unchanged.

                                                               and sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number)
                ,reason
            where sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
              and r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase') t
      group by ss_customer_sk
      order by sumsales, ss_customer_sk
 LIMIT 100;
```

**Key insight:** Filter dimension table (reason) FIRST, then join to fact. Reduces returns to only 'duplicate purchase' before expensive store_sales join.

**AFTER (fast):**
[filtered_reason]:
```sql
SELECT r_reason_sk FROM reason WHERE r_reason_desc = 'duplicate purchase'
```
[filtered_returns]:
```sql
SELECT sr_item_sk, sr_ticket_number, sr_return_quantity FROM store_returns JOIN filtered_reason ON sr_reason_sk = r_reason_sk
```
[main_query]:
```sql
SELECT ss_customer_sk, SUM(act_sales) AS sumsales FROM (SELECT ss.ss_customer_sk, CASE WHEN NOT fr.sr_return_quantity IS NULL THEN (ss.ss_quantity - fr.sr_return_quantity) * ss.ss_sales_price ELSE (ss.ss_quantity * ss.ss_sales_price) END AS act_sales FROM store_sales ss JOIN filtered_returns fr ON (fr.sr_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk AND fr.sr_ticket_number = ss.ss_ticket_number)) AS t GROUP BY ss_customer_sk ORDER BY sumsales, ss_customer_sk LIMIT 100
```

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.
