**Changes**: Isolated date and item dimension filters into separate CTEs (`filtered_dates`, `filtered_items`) to enable predicate pushdown and create small hash tables before joining with the large fact table. Converted implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax for better optimizer handling.

**Expected speedup**: 1.8-2.5x by reducing dimension table scans and creating smaller hash tables for fact table joins.
