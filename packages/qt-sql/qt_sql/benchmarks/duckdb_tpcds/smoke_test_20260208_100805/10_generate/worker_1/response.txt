**Changes:** Created CTEs to pre-filter dimension tables (date_dim and item) before joining with the large fact table store_sales, converting implicit joins to explicit JOIN syntax.

**Expected speedup:** 1.5-2x by reducing the fact table join cardinality through early filtering of dimension tables.
