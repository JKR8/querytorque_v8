Changes: Restructured using aggressive_prefetch_restructure strategy: (1) created CTEs for pre-filtered date_dim and item tables with selective predicates, (2) created a staged CTE that pre-joins only the filtered dimension keys with the fact table, (3) consolidated aggregation in final SELECT.

Expected speedup: 2.5-3.5x due to reduced intermediate data volume and early fact table pruning via pre-filtered dimension keys.
