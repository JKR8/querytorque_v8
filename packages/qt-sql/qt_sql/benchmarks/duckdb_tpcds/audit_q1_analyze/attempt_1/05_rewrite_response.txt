```sql

  WHERE s_state = 'SD'
),
store_customer_returns AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return,
    AVG(SUM(SR_FEE)) OVER (PARTITION BY sr_store_sk) AS store_avg_return
  FROM store_returns
  JOIN date_dim ON sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
  JOIN sd_stores ON sr_store_sk = sd_stores.s_store_sk
  WHERE d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM store_customer_returns ctr1
JOIN customer ON ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
WHERE ctr1.ctr_total_return > ctr1.store_avg_return * 1.2

```

Changes: Pushed store state filter early into a CTE and joined it with store_returns before aggregation, then computed per-store averages using a window function to eliminate the correlated subquery.

Expected speedup: 10-20x by reducing fact table scan to only SD stores and eliminating O(N²) correlated subquery pattern.
