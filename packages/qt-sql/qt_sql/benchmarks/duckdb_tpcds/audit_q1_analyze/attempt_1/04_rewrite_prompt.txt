You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_1

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE
    sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. customer_total_return
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Stats**: 85% Cost | ~557k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return]
**Dependencies**: store_returns, date_dim (join)
**Joins**: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2000
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
  SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE
  sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY
  sr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk
```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Stats**: 13% Cost | ~539k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, CORRELATED_SUBQUERY(ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk), ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_customer_id] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery)
**Joins**: s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk | ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
**Filters**: ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk) | s_state = 'SD'
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[customer], CTE_SCAN, SEQ_SCAN[store], COLUMN_DATA_SCAN, CTE_SCAN
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**customer_total_return CTE**: Computes total return fees for each customer at each store during the year 2000. It joins the large `store_returns` fact table (~2.8B rows) with `date_dim` (~73k rows) and groups by customer+store. Outputs ~557k aggregated rows.

**main_query**: Finds customers in SD stores whose total return is 20% above the store's average, joining the CTE twice (once directly, once in correlated subquery) with `store` (~1k rows) and `customer` (~2M rows). Processes 539k rows but outputs only 100 after ordering. The correlated subquery recalculates per-store averages repeatedly.

### Performance Bottleneck
The dominant cost (85%) is the initial CTE scanning `store_returns` + `date_dim`. However, the **performance mechanism** is: *Scanning the entire fact table without store-state filtering, then re-processing all 557k rows repeatedly in a correlated subquery.*

Specifically:
1. **Unfiltered fact scan**: The CTE joins `store_returns` with `date_dim` but doesn't filter by `s_state = 'SD'`. It processes all stores globally, though only SD stores are needed.
2. **Correlated subquery N² pattern**: For each qualifying SD store row, the subquery `AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2` rescans the entire CTE (557k rows) filtered only by matching `ctr_store_sk`. This creates O(N*M) work where N = SD stores and M = total stores.
3. **Late dimension filtering**: The `store` table filter (`s_state = 'SD'`) happens after aggregation, missing pushdown opportunities.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
### Change 1: Decorate and pre-aggregate per-store averages
**What**: Extract the correlated subquery into a separate CTE that computes store averages once, then join instead of correlate.
**Why**: Eliminates repeated scanning of the 557k-row CTE. The subquery currently runs for each SD store row; moving to a single scan + join reduces work from O(N*M) to O(N+M).
**Risk**: Must ensure NULL handling for stores without returns is consistent (should be fine as original uses INNER logic).
**Impact**: Significant (removes main quadratic component).

### Change 2: Push store-state filter into initial CTE via early dimension join
**What**: Join `store` table early in the CTE to filter by `s_state = 'SD'` before aggregating `store_returns`.
**Why**: Reduces the fact table scan from processing all stores to only SD stores. With ~1k stores total and SD being a small subset, this could reduce `store_returns` rows processed by 95%+.
**Risk**: Must preserve correct aggregation granularity (customer+store). The filter might exclude stores with returns but no matching store record (unlikely in star schema).
**Impact**: Significant (reduces largest table scan).

### Change 3: Merge the two CTE scans into single-pass aggregation
**What**: Compute both customer-level aggregates and store-level averages in one CTE using window functions or two-level aggregation.
**Why**: Avoids materializing and scanning the 557k-row CTE twice (once for main rows, once for averages).
**Risk**: Window function might require careful partitioning; must match original subquery scope (per-store averages).
**Impact**: Moderate (reduces intermediate data volume).

### Recommended Approach
**Implement all three changes in sequence**:

1. **Pre-filter SD stores**: Create a CTE `sd_stores` with just `s_store_sk` where `s_state = 'SD'`.
2. **Single-pass aggregation**: Build a CTE that joins `store_returns` → `date_dim` → `sd_stores`, filters to `d_year = 2000`, then aggregates with `GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk` to get customer totals, and simultaneously computes store averages via `AVG(SUM(SR_FEE)) OVER (PARTITION BY sr_store_sk)` or a second grouped aggregate.
3. **Direct join**: Replace the correlated subquery with a simple filter comparing `ctr_total_return > store_avg * 1.2` using the precomputed store average from step 2.
4. **Final join** with `customer` for IDs, order, and limit.

This transforms the query from:
- Scan all returns → aggregate all stores → filter SD stores → N² correlated subquery
To:
- Scan only SD store returns → single aggregation with per-store averages → simple filter → final join

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

FAISS picks are relevant but incomplete. The optimal pattern combines:
- **decorrelate** for the subquery
- **early_filter** for store-state pushdown  
- **single_pass_aggregation** for computing customer totals and store averages together

**EXAMPLES: decorrelate, early_filter, single_pass_aggregation**

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.
