You are a SQL query rewrite engine.

Your goal: rewrite the complete SQL query to maximize execution speed
while preserving exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns,
same ordering).

You will receive the full query, its DAG structure showing how CTEs and
subqueries connect, cost analysis per node, and reference examples of
proven rewrites on structurally similar queries.
You may restructure the query freely: create new CTEs, merge existing ones,
push filters across node boundaries, or decompose subqueries.

## Query: query_1

```sql
WITH customer_total_return AS (
  SELECT
    sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
    SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
  FROM store_returns, date_dim
  WHERE
    sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
  GROUP BY
    sr_customer_sk,
    sr_store_sk
)
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Query Structure (DAG)

### 1. customer_total_return
**Role**: CTE (Definition Order: 0)
**Stats**: 85% Cost | ~557k rows
**Flags**: GROUP_BY
**Outputs**: [ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return]
**Dependencies**: store_returns, date_dim (join)
**Joins**: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
**Filters**: d_year = 2000
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[store_returns], SEQ_SCAN[date_dim], HASH_GROUP_BY
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
  SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return
FROM store_returns, date_dim
WHERE
  sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY
  sr_customer_sk,
  sr_store_sk
```

### 2. main_query
**Role**: Root / Output (Definition Order: 1)
**Stats**: 13% Cost | ~539k rows processed → 100 rows output
**Flags**: GROUP_BY, CORRELATED_SUBQUERY(ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk), ORDER_BY, LIMIT(100)
**Outputs**: [c_customer_id] — ordered by c_customer_id ASC
**Dependencies**: customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery)
**Joins**: s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk | ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
**Filters**: ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk) | s_state = 'SD'
**Operators**: SEQ_SCAN[customer], CTE_SCAN, SEQ_SCAN[store], COLUMN_DATA_SCAN, CTE_SCAN
**Key Logic (SQL)**:
```sql
SELECT
  c_customer_id
FROM customer_total_return AS ctr1, store, customer
WHERE
  ctr1.ctr_total_return > (
    SELECT
      AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2
    FROM customer_total_return AS ctr2
    WHERE
      ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk
  )
  AND s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
  AND s_state = 'SD'
  AND ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
ORDER BY
  c_customer_id
LIMIT 100
```

## Optimization History

### All Previous Attempts

- unknown: **1.85x improvement** ✓
- unknown: **1.58x improvement** ✓

## Expert Analysis

### Query Structure
**customer_total_return CTE**: Computes total return amounts (sum of SR_FEE) for each customer-store combination in year 2000. Scans store_returns (~large fact table) joined with date_dim (~small dimension), outputs ~557K rows of customer-store aggregates.

**main_query**: Finds customers whose total return at a store exceeds 1.2x the average return for that store, limited to stores in South Dakota (SD). Processes ~539K rows from the CTE, joins with store (filtered by state) and customer tables, outputs 100 customer IDs ordered by ID.

### Performance Bottleneck
**Dominant bottleneck**: Correlated subquery inside main_query's WHERE clause.

**Mechanism**: For each row in ctr1 (after joining with store and customer), the query executes a separate aggregation (AVG) over the entire CTE (ctr2) filtered by matching store_sk. This creates O(n²) computational complexity where each of ~539K rows triggers a full scan/aggregation of the 557K-row CTE. Even with DuckDB's potential optimizations, this correlation prevents efficient batch processing.

**Secondary issues**:
1. The CTE filters only by year 2000, but the main query further filters stores by state='SD'. This filter happens AFTER the CTE aggregation, missing early reduction opportunity.
2. The ORDER BY c_customer_id + LIMIT 100 suggests we could use early stopping if the data were sorted, but the current plan processes all rows before sorting.

### Proposed Optimization Strategy
### **Optimization 1: Decorrelate the subquery**
- **What**: Extract store-level averages into a separate CTE before the main query, then join instead of correlated filtering.
- **Why**: Eliminates O(n²) behavior by computing store averages once (O(n)) and using hash join (O(n)).
- **Risk**: Must ensure NULL handling for stores with no returns matches original semantics (both CTEs filter same date range).
- **Impact**: Significant (likely 2-5x).

### **Optimization 2: Push store state filter into CTE**
- **What**: Join store table early in the CTE to filter by state='SD' before aggregation.
- **Why**: Reduces CTE cardinality from ~557K to only SD stores before expensive GROUP BY and SUM.
- **Risk**: Changes semantics if store dimension has type 2 SCD issues (different states over time). Verify business logic.
- **Impact**: Moderate (depends on SD store count).

### **Optimization 3: Materialize CTE with store averages**
- **What**: Combine both aggregations (customer-store totals and store averages) in a single CTE scan using window functions.
- **Why**: Single pass over store_returns computes both metrics, avoiding repeated scans.
- **Risk**: Window function over 557K rows may have memory implications, but cheaper than correlated subquery.
- **Impact**: Significant.

### Lessons from Previous Failures
**Attempt 1 (WIN 1.85x)**: Likely basic decorrelation attempt but missed state filter pushdown, leaving CTE too large.

**Attempt 2 (WIN 1.58x)**: Possibly tried only materialize_cte without addressing correlation, getting limited benefit.

**Lesson**: Need combined approach addressing BOTH correlation AND early filtering for maximum impact.

### Recommended Approach
Implement **combined decorrelation with early filtering**:

1. Create a filtered_date CTE for year 2000 dates (small dimension prefetch).
2. Create a filtered_stores CTE for SD stores (small dimension prefetch).
3. Create a single CTE that joins store_returns with both filtered dimensions, computes:
   - Customer-store total returns (GROUP BY)
   - Store average returns (via window function or separate aggregation joined)
4. Main query simply filters where customer_total > 1.2 * store_average.

This addresses all three issues: correlation (via precomputed store averages), early filtering (via dimension CTEs), and single pass (consolidated CTE).

Implementation sketch:
```sql
WITH filtered_dates AS (SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000),
     filtered_stores AS (SELECT s_store_sk FROM store WHERE s_state = 'SD'),
     store_returns_filtered AS (
         SELECT sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, sr_fee
         FROM store_returns sr
         INNER JOIN filtered_dates fd ON sr.sr_returned_date_sk = fd.d_date_sk
         INNER JOIN filtered_stores fs ON sr.sr_store_sk = fs.s_store_sk
     ),
     customer_store_totals AS (
         SELECT 
             sr_customer_sk AS ctr_customer_sk,
             sr_store_sk AS ctr_store_sk,
             SUM(sr_fee) AS ctr_total_return,
             AVG(SUM(sr_fee)) OVER (PARTITION BY sr_store_sk) AS store_avg_return
         FROM store_returns_filtered
         GROUP BY sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk
     )
SELECT c_customer_id
FROM customer_store_totals ctr
INNER JOIN customer c ON ctr.ctr_customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk
WHERE ctr.ctr_total_return > ctr.store_avg_return * 1.2
ORDER BY c_customer_id
LIMIT 100;
```

## 6. EXAMPLE SELECTION

FAISS picks are relevant but incomplete. I recommend:

**decorrelate** (core pattern), **early_filter** (push state filter), **dimension_cte_isolate** (pre-filter date and store), **single_pass_aggregation** (combine metrics in one scan)

EXAMPLES: decorrelate, early_filter, dimension_cte_isolate, single_pass_aggregation

Apply the recommended strategy above. The analysis has already identified the bottleneck and the specific structural change needed. Focus on implementing it correctly while preserving semantic equivalence.

## Constraints

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (top of sandwich)

**COMPLETE_OUTPUT**
The rewritten query must output ALL columns from the original SELECT. Never drop, rename, or reorder output columns. Every column alias must be preserved exactly as in the original.

**CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS**
CRITICAL: When creating or modifying a CTE, its SELECT list MUST include ALL columns referenced by downstream queries. Check the Node Contracts section: every column in downstream_refs MUST appear in the CTE output. Also ensure: (1) JOIN columns used by consumers are included in SELECT, (2) every table referenced in WHERE is present in FROM/JOIN, (3) no ambiguous column names between the CTE and re-joined tables. Dropping a column that a downstream node needs will cause an execution error.

**KEEP_EXISTS_AS_EXISTS**
Preserve EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries as-is. Do NOT convert them to IN/NOT IN or to JOINs — this risks NULL-handling semantic changes and can introduce duplicate rows.

**LITERAL_PRESERVATION**
CRITICAL: When rewriting SQL, you MUST copy ALL literal values (strings, numbers, dates) EXACTLY from the original query. Do NOT invent, substitute, or 'improve' any filter values. If the original says d_year = 2000, your rewrite MUST say d_year = 2000. If the original says ca_state = 'GA', your rewrite MUST say ca_state = 'GA'. Changing these values will produce WRONG RESULTS and the rewrite will be REJECTED.

**NO_MATERIALIZE_EXISTS**
Keep EXISTS and NOT EXISTS as-is — they use semi-join short-circuiting that stops scanning after the first match. Converting them to materialized CTEs (e.g., WITH cte AS (SELECT DISTINCT ... FROM large_table)) forces a full table scan, which is catastrophically slower (0.14x observed on Q16). When you see EXISTS, preserve it.

**SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE**
The rewritten query MUST return exactly the same rows, columns, and ordering as the original. This is the prime directive. Any rewrite that changes the result set — even by one row, one column, or a different sort order — is WRONG and will be REJECTED.

### HIGH — Performance and Style Rules (middle of sandwich)

**MIN_BASELINE_THRESHOLD**
If the query execution plan shows very fast runtime (under 100ms), be conservative with CTE-based transforms. Each CTE adds materialization overhead (hash table creation, intermediate result storage). On fast queries, this overhead can exceed the filtering benefit. Prefer minimal changes or no change over adding multiple CTEs to an already-fast query.

**NO_UNFILTERED_DIMENSION_CTE**
Every CTE you create must include a WHERE clause that actually reduces row count. Selecting fewer columns is not filtering — the CTE still materializes every row. If a dimension table has no predicate to push down, leave it as a direct join in the main query instead of wrapping it in a CTE.

**OR_TO_UNION_GUARD**
Only apply or_to_union when (a) the OR branches involve different tables or fundamentally different access paths — never when all branches filter the same column (e.g., t_hour ranges), since the optimizer already handles same-column ORs efficiently in a single scan — and (b) the result is 3 or fewer UNION ALL branches. Nested ORs that would expand into 4+ branches (e.g., 3 conditions x 3 values = 9 combinations) must be left as-is. Violating these rules causes 0.23x–0.59x regressions from multiplied fact table scans.

**REMOVE_REPLACED_CTES**
When creating replacement CTEs, overwrite the original by using the same node_id in your rewrite_sets, or ensure the original is removed from the WITH clause. Every CTE in the final query should be actively used — dead CTEs still get materialized and waste resources (caused 0.49x on Q31, 0.68x on Q74).

**EXPLICIT_JOINS**
Convert comma-separated implicit joins to explicit JOIN ... ON syntax. This gives the optimizer better join-order freedom.

### CRITICAL — Correctness Guards (bottom of sandwich)
