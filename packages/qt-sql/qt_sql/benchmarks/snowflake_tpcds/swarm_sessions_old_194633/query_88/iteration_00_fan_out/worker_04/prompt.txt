You are a SQL rewrite engine for Snowflake. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query counts store sales transactions within specific 30-minute intervals for store 'ese' that meet household demographic conditions (dep_count = -1, 3, or 4 with corresponding vehicle_count thresholds). All joins are INNER = transactions must match all dimension tables. Output preserves 8 distinct count columns with original names/literals. Aggregation uses simple COUNTs (safe for restructuring).

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
filtered_store → sales_time_agg → household_join → final

NODE_CONTRACTS:  
- filtered_store:  
  FROM: store  
  WHERE: s_store_name = 'ese'  
  OUTPUT: s_store_sk  
  EXPECTED_ROWS: 1  
  CONSUMERS: sales_time_agg

  JOIN: filtered_store ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk  
  JOIN: time_dim ON ss_sold_time_sk = t_time_sk  
  WHERE: (t_hour=8 AND t_minute>=30) OR ... (all 8)  
  AGGREGATE: COUNT_IF(t_hour=8 AND t_minute>=30) AS h8_30_to_9, ...  
  GROUP BY: ss_hdemo_sk  
  OUTPUT: ss_hdemo_sk, h8_30_to_9, ...  
  EXPECTED_ROWS: ~500 (distinct households)  
  CONSUMERS: household_join  
- household_join:

  AGGREGATE: SUM(h8_30_to_9) AS h8_30_to_9, ...  
  OUTPUT: h8_30_to_9, h9_to_9_30, ..., h12_to_12_30  
  EXPECTED_ROWS: 1

NODE_CONTRACTS:
- filtered_store:

  WHERE: s_store_name = 'ese'  
  OUTPUT: s_store_sk  
  EXPECTED_ROWS: 1  
  CONSUMERS: sales_time_agg

  WHERE: (t_hour=8 AND t_minute>=30) OR ... (all 8)  
  AGGREGATE: COUNT_IF(t_hour=8 AND t_minute>=30) AS h8_30_to_9, ...

  OUTPUT: h8_30_to_9, h9_to_9_30, ..., h12_to_12_30  
  EXPECTED_ROWS: 1

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- SUM(COUNT) must equal original COUNT  
- Verify household filter not applied before aggregation  
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None  
EXPLORATION_TYPE: compound_strategy  
HYPOTHESIS_TAG: H4_AGGREGATE_BELOW_JOIN + H1_CTE_PREDICATE_FENCE  
HYPOTHESIS: Deferring household join allows store/time filtering before aggregation.  
EVIDENCE: EXPLAIN shows household filter prevents predicate pushdown.  
EXPECTED_MECHANISM: Partial aggregation before household join → smaller working set.  
CONTROL_SIGNAL: If sales_time_agg row count > 1K, aggregation pushdown failed.

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. Single-pass aggregation with FILTER (Q22 regression):  
   CAUSE: FILTER changes STDDEV_SAMP denominator vs separate groups  
   RULE: Use CASE inside COUNT, not FILTER, since groups are disjoint  
2. Late dimension join (Q67 regression):  
   CAUSE: Deferring household_demographics join broke AVG reconstruction  
   RULE: Join dimensions BEFORE aggregation if using AVG/STDDEV

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Must preserve 8 count columns with original names  
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: CTEs must output all join keys + filter columns  
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Exact store name 'ese' and numeric filters (-1,2,3,4)  
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: Maintain INNER join semantics  
- H4_AGGREGATE_BELOW_JOIN: Aggregation keys ⊇ join keys (ss_store_sk, ss_hdemo_sk)  
- H1_CTE_PREDICATE_FENCE: Selective filters (store, household) not pushed into CTE  
- H5_COLUMN_PRUNING_FAILURE: store_sales scan reads 3 columns (optimized)

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Use late_attribute_binding's deferred dimension join.

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `*`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (store_sales, household_demographics, time_dim, store)
    ├── JOIN (ss_sold_time_sk = time_dim.t_time_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ss_hdemo_sk = household_demographics.hd_demo_sk)
    ├── JOIN (+1 more)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_hour = 8)
    ├── FILTER (time_dim.t_minute >= 30)
    ├── FILTER (+1 more)
    └── OUTPUT (*)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
