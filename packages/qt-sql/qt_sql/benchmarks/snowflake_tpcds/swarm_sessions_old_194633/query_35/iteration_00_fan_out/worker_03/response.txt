### Changes
Replaced EXISTS filters with a CTE that precomputes sales-validated customers via UNION, then joined with customer/demographics tables. This moves sales filtering and deduplication upstream before customer joins. Preserved all original output columns, grouping, ordering, and division guards.

### Expected speedup
2-3x by reducing customer table scans via early filtering and eliminating correlated subqueries. UNION deduplication (~155k rows) is cheaper than joining full customer table before filtering.
