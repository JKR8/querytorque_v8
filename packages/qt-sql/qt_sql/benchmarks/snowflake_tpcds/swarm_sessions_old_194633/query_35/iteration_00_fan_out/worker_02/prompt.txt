You are a SQL rewrite engine for Snowflake. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

This query identifies customer demographic patterns across three sales channels (store/web/catalog) during Q1-3 of 2001. All joins are INNER except for optional sales channel participation (OR-exists). Aggregations use COUNT(*) which is duplicate-sensitive due to potential sales joins. Critical filters (d_year=2001, d_qoy<4) must remain exact to avoid temporal scope creep.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
all_sales_cte -> customer_filter -> main_agg
NODE_CONTRACTS:
  all_sales_cte:
    FROM: (
      SELECT ss_customer_sk, 'store' channel FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim...
      UNION ALL
      SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk, 'web' FROM web_sales JOIN date_dim...
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk, 'catalog' FROM catalog_sales JOIN date_dim...
    )
    WHERE: d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4
    OUTPUT: customer_sk, channel
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 72718+27579+54922 = ~155k
    CONSUMERS: customer_filter
  customer_filter:
    FROM: customer c
    WHERE: EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM all_sales_cte WHERE customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk)
    OUTPUT: c.* + ca_state
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~261

NODE_CONTRACTS:
all_sales_cte:
    FROM: (
      SELECT ss_customer_sk, 'store' channel FROM store_sales JOIN date_dim...
      UNION ALL
      SELECT ws_bill_customer_sk, 'web' FROM web_sales JOIN date_dim...
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT cs_ship_customer_sk, 'catalog' FROM catalog_sales JOIN date_dim...
    )
    WHERE: d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4
    OUTPUT: customer_sk, channel
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 72718+27579+54922 = ~155k
    CONSUMERS: customer_filter
  customer_filter:
    FROM: customer c
    WHERE: EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM all_sales_cte WHERE customer_sk = c.c_customer_sk)
    OUTPUT: c.* + ca_state
    EXPECTED_ROWS: ~261

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- UNION ALL changing NULL handling in customer keys
CONSTRAINT_OVERRIDE: None
EXPLORATION_TYPE: novel_combination  
HYPOTHESIS_TAG: H5_COLUMN_PRUNING_FAILURE
HYPOTHESIS: Separate sales scans prevent column pruning
EVIDENCE: All sales scans select full rows (nodes 23,34,44)
EXPECTED_MECHANISM: Single project of customer keys reduces I/O
CONTROL_SIGNAL: Increased bytes scanned due to wider UNION projection

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. EXISTS Materialization (Q14 3.8x regression):
   CAUSE: Converting EXISTS to CTE+JOIN introduced duplicate customers
   RULE: Preserve semi-join semantics via WHERE EXISTS (subquery)

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- COMPLETE_OUTPUT: Complex 19-column output with repeated MAX/SUM aggregates
- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Multiple EXISTS subqueries reference customer key
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Fixed date filters (2001, QOY<4)
- SEMANTIC_EQUIVALENCE: OR-exists between web/catalog sales
- H1_CTE_PREDICATE_FENCE: 3 date_dim scans with same filter (lines 18,28,40)
- H4_AGGREGATE_BELOW_JOIN: Multiple EXISTS filters before final GROUP BY

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Use UNION pattern from union_cte_split but retain EXISTS check from original

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `ca_state`
  2. `cd_gender`
  3. `cd_marital_status`
  4. `cd_dep_count`
  5. `cnt1`
  6. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  7. `SUM(cd_dep_count)`
  8. `MAX(cd_dep_count)`
  9. `cd_dep_employed_count`
  10. `cnt2`
  11. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  12. `SUM(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  13. `MAX(cd_dep_employed_count)`
  14. `cd_dep_college_count`
  15. `cnt3`
  16. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`
  17. `SUM(cd_dep_college_count)`
  18. `MAX(cd_dep_college_count)`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 100%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (customer AS c (join), customer_address AS ca (join), customer_demographics (join), date_dim (join))
    ├── JOIN (c.c_current_addr_sk = ca.ca_address_sk)
    ├── JOIN (cd_demo_sk = c.c_current_cdemo_sk)
    ├── FILTER (EXISTS(SELECT * FROM store_sales, date_dim WHERE c.c_customer_sk = ss_customer_sk AND ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND d_year = 2001 AND d_qoy < 4))
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (ca_state ASC, cd_gender ASC, cd_marital_status ASC, cd_dep_count ASC, cd_dep_employed_count ASC, cd_dep_college_count ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (ca_state, cd_gender, cd_marital_status, cd_dep_count, cnt1, MAX(cd_dep_count), SUM(cd_dep_count), MAX(cd_dep_count), ...)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
