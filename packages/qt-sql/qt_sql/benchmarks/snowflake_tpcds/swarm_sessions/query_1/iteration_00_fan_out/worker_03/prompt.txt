You are a SQL rewrite engine for Snowflake. Follow the Target Logical Tree structure below. Your job is to write correct, executable SQL for each node — not to decide whether to restructure. Preserve exact semantic equivalence (same rows, same columns, same ordering). Preserve defensive guards: if the original uses CASE WHEN x > 0 THEN y/x END around a division, keep it — even when a WHERE clause makes the zero case unreachable. Guards prevent silent breakage if filters change upstream. Strip benchmark comments (-- start query, -- end query) from your output.

## Semantic Contract (MUST preserve)

Identify customers in South Dakota (SD) stores who had 2000 returns exceeding 1.2× their store's average return. Preserve INNER JOIN semantics (all tables must match) and correlated subquery logic. Critical aggregation trap: AVG(ctr_total_return) must be computed per store_sk without state filtering to maintain correctness. Filter dependencies: s_state='SD' cannot be pushed into CTE without breaking subquery semantics.

## Target Logical Tree + Node Contracts

Build your rewrite following this CTE structure. Each node's OUTPUT list is exhaustive — your SQL must produce exactly those columns.

TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE:
ctr_all → store_avg → main_query  
NODE_CONTRACTS:  
  ctr_all:  
    FROM: store_returns, date_dim  
    JOIN: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk  
    WHERE: d_year=2000  
    GROUP BY: sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk  
    AGGREGATE: SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return  
    OUTPUT: sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, ctr_total_return  
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1K  
    CONSUMERS: store_avg, main_query  
  store_avg:  
    FROM: ctr_all  
    GROUP BY: ctr_store_sk  
    AGGREGATE: AVG(ctr_total_return)*1.2 AS avg_return  
    OUTPUT: ctr_store_sk, avg_return  
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 10  
    CONSUMERS: main_query

NODE_CONTRACTS:
ctr_all:  
    FROM: store_returns, date_dim  
    JOIN: sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk  
    WHERE: d_year=2000  
    GROUP BY: sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk  
    AGGREGATE: SUM(SR_FEE) AS ctr_total_return  
    OUTPUT: sr_customer_sk, sr_store_sk, ctr_total_return  
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 1K  
    CONSUMERS: store_avg, main_query  
  store_avg:  
    FROM: ctr_all  
    GROUP BY: ctr_store_sk  
    AGGREGATE: AVG(ctr_total_return)*1.2 AS avg_return  
    OUTPUT: ctr_store_sk, avg_return  
    EXPECTED_ROWS: 10  
    CONSUMERS: main_query

## Hazard Flags (avoid these specific risks)

- Cartesian product if join condition omitted

## Regression Warnings (observed failures on similar queries)

1. AVG Reconstruction Failure (observed regression):  
   CAUSE: Replaced AVG(x) with SUM(x)/COUNT(x) without handling COUNT(x)=0 → division by NULL.  
   RULE: Use AVG() directly or wrap COUNT in NULLIF(COUNT(x),0)

## Constraints (analyst-filtered for this query)

- CTE_COLUMN_COMPLETENESS: Downstream requires ctr_customer_sk/ctr_store_sk/ctr_total_return  
- LITERAL_PRESERVATION: Must preserve d_year=2000, s_state='SD', multiplier=1.2  
- H1_CTE_PREDICATE_FENCE: CTE referenced 2x (ctr1/ctr2) with selective s_state='SD' filter applied late  
- H4_AGGREGATE_BELOW_JOIN: Aggregation after join despite keys ⊆ join keys

## Example Adaptation Notes

For each example: what to apply to your rewrite, and what to ignore.

Apply scalar subquery-to-join. Ignore EXISTS conversion.

## Original SQL

```sql
-- start query 1 in stream 0 using template query1.tpl
with customer_total_return as
(select sr_customer_sk as ctr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk as ctr_store_sk
,sum(SR_FEE) as ctr_total_return
from store_returns
,date_dim
where sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk
and d_year =2000
group by sr_customer_sk
,sr_store_sk)
 select c_customer_id
from customer_total_return ctr1
,store
,customer
where ctr1.ctr_total_return > (select avg(ctr_total_return)*1.2
from customer_total_return ctr2
where ctr1.ctr_store_sk = ctr2.ctr_store_sk)
and s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk
and s_state = 'SD'
and ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk
order by c_customer_id
 LIMIT 100;

-- end query 1 in stream 0 using template query1.tpl
```

## Rewrite Checklist (must pass before final SQL)

- Follow every node in `TARGET_LOGICAL_TREE` and produce each `NODE_CONTRACT` output column exactly.
- Keep all semantic invariants from `Semantic Contract` and `Constraints` (including join/null behavior).
- Preserve all literals and the exact final output schema/order.
- Apply `Hazard Flags` and `Regression Warnings` as hard guards against known failure modes.

### Column Completeness Contract

Your `main_query` component MUST produce **exactly** these output columns (same names, same order):

  1. `c_customer_id`

Do NOT add, remove, or rename any output columns. The result set schema must be identical to the original query.

## Original Query Structure

This is the current query structure. All nodes are `[=]` (unchanged). Your modified Logic Tree below should show which nodes you changed.

```
QUERY: (single statement)
├── [CTE] customer_total_return  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K
│   ├── SCAN (store_returns, date_dim (join))
│   ├── JOIN (sr_returned_date_sk = d_date_sk)
│   ├── FILTER (d_year = 2000)
│   ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
│   └── OUTPUT (ctr_customer_sk, ctr_store_sk, ctr_total_return)
└── [MAIN] main_query  [=]  Cost: 50%  Rows: ~1K
    ├── SCAN (customer_total_return AS ctr1 (join), store (join), customer (join), customer_total_return AS ctr2 (correlated subquery))
    ├── JOIN (s_store_sk = ctr1.ctr_store_sk)
    ├── JOIN (ctr1.ctr_customer_sk = c_customer_sk)
    ├── FILTER (ctr1.ctr_total_return > AVG(ctr_total_return) * 1.2 (per store_sk))
    ├── FILTER (s_state = 'SD')
    ├── AGG (GROUP BY)
    ├── SORT (c_customer_id ASC)
    └── OUTPUT (c_customer_id)
```

## Output Format

Your response has **two parts** in order:

### Part 1: Modified Logic Tree

Show what changed using change markers. Generate the tree BEFORE writing SQL.

Change markers:
- `[+]` — New component added
- `[-]` — Component removed
- `[~]` — Component modified (describe what changed)
- `[=]` — Unchanged (no children needed)
- `[!]` — Structural change (e.g. CTE → subquery)

### Part 2: Component Payload JSON

```json
{
  "spec_version": "1.0",
  "dialect": "<dialect>",
  "rewrite_rules": [
    {"id": "R1", "type": "<transform_name>", "description": "<what changed>", "applied_to": ["<component_id>"]}
  ],
  "statements": [{
    "target_table": null,
    "change": "modified",
    "components": {
      "<cte_name>": {
        "type": "cte",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<complete SQL for this CTE body>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<upstream_id>"]}
      },
      "main_query": {
        "type": "main_query",
        "change": "modified",
        "sql": "<final SELECT>",
        "interfaces": {"outputs": ["col1", "col2"], "consumes": ["<cte_name>"]}
      }
    },
    "reconstruction_order": ["<cte_name>", "main_query"],
    "assembly_template": "WITH <cte_name> AS ({<cte_name>}) {main_query}"
  }],
  "macros": {},
  "frozen_blocks": [],
  "validation_checks": []
}
```

### Rules
- **Tree first, always.** Generate the Logic Tree before writing any SQL
- **One component at a time.** When writing SQL for component X, treat others as opaque interfaces
- **No ellipsis.** Every `sql` value must be complete, executable SQL
- **Frozen blocks are copy-paste.** Large CASE-WHEN lookups must be verbatim
- **Validate interfaces.** Verify every `consumes` reference exists in upstream `outputs`
- Only include components you **changed or added** — set unchanged components to `"change": "unchanged"` with `"sql": ""`
- `main_query` output columns must match the Column Completeness Contract above
- `reconstruction_order`: topological order of components for assembly

After the JSON, explain the mechanism:

```
Changes: <1-2 sentences: what structural change + the expected mechanism>
Expected speedup: <estimate>
```

Now output your Logic Tree and Component Payload JSON:
