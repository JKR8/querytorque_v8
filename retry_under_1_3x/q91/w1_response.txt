  "explanation": "Split the OR condition into UNION ALL branches to eliminate costly OR predicate evaluation and enable better filter pushdown. Added early filtering CTEs for date, address, and household demographics to reduce join sizes early. Each branch has fixed values for marital_status and education_status, allowing the optimizer to create more efficient plans. The UNION ALL preserves all rows from original OR condition."
