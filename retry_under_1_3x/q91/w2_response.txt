  "explanation": "Created CTEs for each dimension table with their filters (date_dim, customer_demographics, household_demographics, customer_address) to reduce cardinality before joining. Isolated the date filter into a CTE to join with catalog_returns early, reducing fact table rows. This avoids scanning large tables multiple times and applies selective filters early."
