  "explanation": "The OR condition on customer_demographics causes sequential scans and misestimates. Split into UNION ALL of two exclusive branches with separate filtered CTEs for each marital/education status combination. Also created early-filter CTEs for date_dim, customer_address, and household_demographics to reduce join sizes. The UNION ALL approach eliminates the OR predicate evaluation during joins and allows better cardinality estimation."
