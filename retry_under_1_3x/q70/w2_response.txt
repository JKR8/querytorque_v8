  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into CTE to reduce join cardinality early. Created filtered_sales CTE that pre-joins store_sales with filtered dates and store, eliminating redundant scans. Materialized top_states subquery as CTE to compute once rather than per-row. This reduces multiple scans of store_sales and date_dim from the original query."
