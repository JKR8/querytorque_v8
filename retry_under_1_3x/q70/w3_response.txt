  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations. First (rs_01): Isolate date_dim filtering into a reusable CTE, reducing duplicate full table scans from 2 to 1. Second (rs_02): Materialize the expensive ranking subquery into a CTE, preventing re-execution of the complex window function for each outer query row. These transforms reduce the total scans of store_sales from 2 to 1 and eliminate redundant date_dim processing."
