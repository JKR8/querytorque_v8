Looking at the query pattern, I identify a correlated subquery opportunity (QT-OPT-002) and pushdown opportunities. The main query filters the CTE result by `i_color = 'peach'`, which can be pushed into the CTE before aggregation. Additionally, the HAVING clause contains a correlated subquery that computes an average from the CTE - this can be precomputed as a separate CTE.

Here's my rewrite strategy:
1. Push `i_color = 'peach'` filter into the CTE to reduce aggregation cost
2. Extract the correlated subquery into a precomputed CTE for the threshold value
3. Keep the original CTE structure but with early filtering

  "explanation": "Pushed i_color = 'peach' filter into the CTE before aggregation, reducing the number of rows processed in the expensive GROUP BY.
