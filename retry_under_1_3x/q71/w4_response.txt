  "explanation": "Isolated the date_dim filter (d_moy=11 AND d_year=1999) into a CTE, eliminating three separate date_dim scans (one per UNION ALL branch). Also isolated the time_dim OR condition into a filtered CTE. This reduces the number of large table scans and allows the optimizer to apply filters earlier in the plan."
