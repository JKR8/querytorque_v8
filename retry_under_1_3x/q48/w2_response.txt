  "explanation": "Two complementary rewrites: (1) OR-to-UNION decomposes the three OR branches into separate UNION ALL queries with CTEs for date/store filtering, eliminating expensive OR join conditions. (2) Date CTE isolation pre-filters dimension tables and store_sales before applying the OR conditions, reducing join cardinality early. Both preserve the exact same SUM result."
