Looking at this query, I can see two main optimization opportunities: **date dimension prefetching** and **OR-to-UNION decomposition**. The query has complex OR conditions that could be split into separate branches, and the date filter can be isolated into a CTE.

  "explanation": "Applied two transforms: 1) Isolated date_dim filter into a CTE to reduce early join size (date_cte_isolate). 2) Converted the complex OR conditions into 9 UNION ALL branches (or_to_union), each representing a specific combination of demographic and address conditions. This allows the optimizer to use more specific indexes and push predicates earlier. Combined, these transforms should significantly reduce the store_sales scan and filter operations."
