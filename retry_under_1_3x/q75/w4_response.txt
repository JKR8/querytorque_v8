Looking at this query structure, I can see two main optimization opportunities:

1. **Date filter pushdown into the union CTE** - Currently, `all_sales` aggregates all years, then `main_query` filters for specific years (2002 and 2001). We can push these year filters into the CTE.

2. **Date CTE isolation** - Multiple date_dim joins in the union can be consolidated using a CTE.

Here's my optimized rewrite:

  ],
  "explanation": "Pushed year filters (2001, 2002) from main_query into the all_sales CTE using filtered_dates CTE. This reduces the data scanned from all years to only the needed years before aggregation. Also isolated date_dim scans into a single CTE (filtered_dates) to avoid redundant filtering and joins."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. The original `all_sales` CTE aggregates ALL years, but `main_query` only needs 2001 and 2002. By pushing year filters into the CTE, we reduce the data volume by ~97% (assuming uniform year distribution).
2. Created a `filtered_dates` CTE to isolate date_dim filtering and avoid 3 separate date_dim scans in the union.
3. The pushdown transform is low-risk because we're filtering earlier but preserving all required data for the main query.
4. This optimization is similar to the example "PUSHDOWN: [main_query] filters on [all_sales] after GROUP BY" with expected 2x speedup.
