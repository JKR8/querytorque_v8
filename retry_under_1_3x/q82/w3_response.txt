Looking at this query, I can see several optimization opportunities. The main issues are:
1. Date dimension is filtered but joined late
2. Item table is filtered but joined early
3. Inventory table is scanned multiple times
4. The store_sales table is very large (345M rows) and joined without any filters

Here's the optimized rewrite:

      "id": "rs_01",
      "transform": "date_cte_isolate",

        "filtered_items": "SELECT i_item_sk, i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM item WHERE i_current_price BETWEEN 62 AND 92 AND i_manufact_id IN (129, 270, 821, 423)",
        "filtered_inventory": "SELECT inv_item_sk FROM inventory JOIN filtered_dates ON d_date_sk = inv_date_sk WHERE inv_quantity_on_hand BETWEEN 100 AND 500",
        "main_query": "SELECT i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price FROM filtered_items fi JOIN filtered_inventory inv ON fi.i_item_sk = inv.inv_item_sk JOIN store_sales ss ON fi.i_item_sk = ss.ss_item_sk GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, i_current_price ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100"
      },
      "invariants_kept": [
        "same result rows",
        "same output columns",
        "same grouping",
        "same ordering"
      ],
      "expected_speedup": "5x",
      "risk": "low"
    }
  ],
  "explanation": "Isolated date filtering into CTE to reduce date_dim scan from 73K to 61 rows. Pre-filtered item table to reduce from 102K to ~3.4K rows. Created filtered_inventory CTE that joins date early to reduce inventory scan from 1.6B to 1.5M rows. Store_sales is joined last as it's the largest table (345M rows) and only needed for grouping. This transforms the query from multiple large table joins to a pipeline of progressively filtered intermediate results."
}
```

**Key insights:**
1. The date filter reduces date_dim from 73K to 61 rows - filtering this first reduces all downstream joins
2. Item filters reduce from 102K to ~3.4K rows - filtering early prevents unnecessary joins
3. Inventory has quantity filter plus date join - creating a CTE with both reduces from 1.6B to 1.5M rows
4. Store_sales is the largest table but has no filters - joining it last with pre-filtered items minimizes the join size
5. The GROUP BY collapses to only 6 rows in final output - early filtering reduces the amount of data that needs aggregation
