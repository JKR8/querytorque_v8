  "explanation": "Transformed the Cartesian join pattern to push dimension filters (date, item, inventory) early into CTEs, reducing intermediate join sizes from millions to thousands. Replaced the many-to-many join with EXISTS semi-joins to avoid redundant row explosion while preserving the same logical item qualification. This eliminates the massive group-by that was only needed for deduplication, not aggregation."
