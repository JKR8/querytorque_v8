  "explanation": "Created CTEs to isolate date_dim and item filters early, allowing store_sales to join only with relevant dimension rows instead of scanning entire tables. This reduces join cardinality from ~345M to ~30 date rows × ~1.8k items. The store_sales scan remains but joins are now selective early."
