Looking at the query, I can identify an opportunity to push the date_dim filter into a CTE and join it early with store_sales. This matches the QT-OPT-003 Date CTE Isolation pattern. The query has a high cost from scanning store_sales (98.4%) and joining it late in the plan. By filtering date_dim early and pushing it into the join, we can reduce the number of store_sales rows processed early.

  "explanation": "Extracted date_dim filter into a CTE to enable early filtering and reduce the store_sales join size. The date_dim table is filtered first (73,049 -> 30 rows), then joined with store_sales before joining with item. This reduces the number of store_sales rows processed in the main hash join from the entire table to only those matching the 30 filtered dates."
