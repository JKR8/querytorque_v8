  "explanation": "Created a materialized CTE for the repeated date subquery pattern. The subquery filtering by three specific dates and their week sequences was being executed 9 times total (3 CTEs × 3 times each). Now it's computed once and reused. This reduces multiple scans of date_dim from 9 to 1, and eliminates redundant computations of the week sequence logic."
