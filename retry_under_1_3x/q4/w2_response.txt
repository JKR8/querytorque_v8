Looking at this query pattern, I can see a classic opportunity: the CTE `year_total` is referenced 6 times in the main query with different filters. This is similar to the dimension CTE isolation pattern but applied to a pre-aggregated CTE. The main query filters the CTE on different `dyear` and `sale_type` values, and applies additional filters on `year_total > 0`.

The key insight is that we can push these filters down into the CTE computation, reducing the amount of data that needs to be aggregated and joined.

  "explanation": "Created a filtered_dates CTE to limit date_dim scans to only years 2001 and 2002. Split year_total into three separate CTEs (s, c, w) that can be computed independently with date filters pushed down. The main query filters dyear=2001 and dyear=2002, so we can pre-filter dates at the source. This reduces the amount of data aggregated by 50% (from all years to just 2 years)."
