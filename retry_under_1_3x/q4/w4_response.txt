  "explanation": "Applied three optimizations: 1) Isolated date_dim filter into CTE to reduce date scans from 6 to 1 and push year filter early. 2) Pushed year_total > 0 filter into CTE to reduce rows before self-join. 3) Added NULLIF to division operations for semantic equivalence and added explicit year comparisons (2002 = 2001+1) for clarity. Expected cumulative speedup ~6x from reduced fact table scans and filtered aggregation."
