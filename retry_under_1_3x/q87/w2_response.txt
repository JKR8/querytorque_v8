  "explanation": "Extracted the common date filter (d_month_seq BETWEEN 1200 AND 1211) into a single CTE that scans date_dim once and returns only the needed d_date_sk and d_date columns. Each fact table (store_sales, catalog_sales, web_sales) now joins with this pre-filtered date CTE, reducing the cardinality of the date joins by ~39x (from 73k to 366 rows). The customer table joins remain unchanged. This transforms three separate filtered date_dim scans (each with high misestimate) into one efficient scan and allows early filtering of fact rows before the expensive DISTINCT and EXCEPT operations."
