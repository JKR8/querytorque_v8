  "explanation": "Applied two independent optimizations: (1) OR_TO_UNION to split the OR condition on household_demographics into two mutually exclusive branches using UNION ALL with anti-join to avoid duplicates, allowing separate index usage for hd_dep_count=6 and hd_vehicle_count>2. (2) DATE_CTE_ISOLATE to pre-filter date_dim and join early, reducing the fact table join cardinality. These can be applied separately or combined."
