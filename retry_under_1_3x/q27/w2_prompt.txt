## Example: Date CTE Isolation (DATE_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 4.00x

### Input:
[main_query]:
SELECT a.ca_state state, count(*) cnt
FROM customer_address a, customer c, store_sales s, date_dim d, item i
WHERE a.ca_address_sk = c.c_current_addr_sk
  AND c.c_customer_sk = s.ss_customer_sk
  AND s.ss_sold_date_sk = d.d_date_sk
  AND s.ss_item_sk = i.i_item_sk
  AND d.d_month_seq = (SELECT DISTINCT d_month_seq FROM date_dim WHERE d_year = 2000 AND d_moy = 1)
  AND i.i_current_price > 1.2 * (SELECT avg(j.i_current_price) FROM item j WHERE j.i_category = i.i_category)
GROUP BY a.ca_state HAVING count(*) >= 10
ORDER BY cnt, a.ca_state LIMIT 100

### Output:

  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Extract date month_seq subquery into CTE. Extract category average into separate CTE with GROUP BY. Join instead of correlated subquery. This allows each CTE to be scanned once.

## Example: Dimension CTE Isolation (DIMENSION_CTE_ISOLATE)
Verified speedup: 1.93x

### Input:
SELECT i_item_id, avg(cs_quantity) agg1, avg(cs_list_price) agg2, avg(cs_coupon_amt) agg3, avg(cs_sales_price) agg4
FROM catalog_sales, customer_demographics, date_dim, item, promotion
WHERE cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk AND cs_item_sk = i_item_sk
  AND cs_bill_cdemo_sk = cd_demo_sk AND cs_promo_sk = p_promo_sk
  AND cd_gender = 'M' AND cd_marital_status = 'S' AND cd_education_status = 'College'
  AND (p_channel_email = 'N' OR p_channel_event = 'N') AND d_year = 2000
GROUP BY i_item_id ORDER BY i_item_id LIMIT 100

### Output:

    }
  ]
}
```

**Key insight:** Pre-filter EACH dimension table into its own CTE returning only the surrogate key. This reduces the cardinality of subsequent joins. Works best when dimension filters are highly selective.

### Input:

  sum(ss_quantity) AS store_sales_quantity,
  sum(sr_return_quantity) AS store_returns_quantity,
  sum(cs_quantity) AS catalog_sales_quantity
FROM store_sales, store_returns, catalog_sales,
  date_dim d1, date_dim d2, date_dim d3, store, item
WHERE d1.d_moy = 9 AND d1.d_year = 1999 AND d1.d_date_sk = ss_sold_date_sk
  AND d2.d_moy BETWEEN 9 AND 12 AND d2.d_year = 1999 AND sr_returned_date_sk = d2.d_date_sk
  AND d3.d_year IN (1999, 2000, 2001) AND cs_sold_date_sk = d3.d_date_sk
  AND ss_customer_sk = sr_customer_sk AND ss_item_sk = sr_item_sk AND ss_ticket_number = sr_ticket_number
  AND sr_customer_sk = cs_bill_customer_sk AND sr_item_sk = cs_item_sk
GROUP BY i_item_id, i_item_desc, s_store_id, s_store_name LIMIT 100

}
```

**Key insight:** When a query references date_dim multiple times with different filters (d1, d2, d3 pattern), create separate CTEs for each date range. Then pre-join each date CTE with its corresponding fact table. This filters the fact tables early before the expensive multi-way join.

You are an autonomous Query Rewrite Engine. Your goal is to maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.

Output atomic rewrite sets in JSON.

RULES:
- Primary Goal: Maximize execution speed while strictly preserving semantic invariants.
- Allowed Transforms: Use the provided list. If a standard SQL optimization applies that is not listed, label it "semantic_rewrite".
- Atomic Sets: Group dependent changes (e.g., creating a CTE and joining it) into a single rewrite_set.
- Contracts: Output columns, grain, and total result rows must remain invariant.
- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
- Column Aliasing: Permitted only for aggregations or disambiguation.

ALLOWED TRANSFORMS: pushdown, decorrelate, or_to_union, early_filter, date_cte_isolate, materialize_cte, flatten_subquery, reorder_join, multi_push_predicate, inline_cte, remove_redundant, semantic_rewrite

1. **QT-OPT-003** - Date CTE Isolation
  Trigger: date_dim joined with d_year/d_qoy/d_month filter, fact table present
  Rewrite: Create CTE: SELECT d_date_sk FROM date_dim WHERE filter, join fact to CTE early
   Matched: date_dim filter with fact table


Now output your rewrite_sets:
