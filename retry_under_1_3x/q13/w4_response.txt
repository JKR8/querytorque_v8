  "explanation": "The original query has two independent OR conditions spanning multiple tables, causing complex predicate evaluation and forcing sequential scans. By transforming to UNION ALL with specialized branches: (1) Each branch has focused predicates on specific marital status, education, price ranges, and profit ranges, enabling better index usage if available. (2) The date filter is extracted to a CTE and reused across all branches. (3) The branches are mutually exclusive due to disjoint conditions on marital_status + education + sales_price ranges, preventing duplicates. This reduces predicate evaluation complexity and allows the optimizer to apply more efficient join strategies per branch."
