  "explanation": "Extracted date filter into CTE to avoid repeated scanning of date_dim. Decorrelated the subquery by pre-computing average discount per item for the date range in a separate CTE. Pre-filtered items by manufacturer to reduce join size early. This reduces multiple full table scans to single filtered scans with early aggregation."
