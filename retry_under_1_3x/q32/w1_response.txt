  "explanation": "Decorrelated the subquery by precomputing average discount per item for the date range in a CTE, then joining instead of correlated execution. Also isolated date_dim filter into CTE for early reduction. This eliminates repeated scans of catalog_sales and date_dim while maintaining identical semantics."
