  "explanation": "1. Isolated date filter for 1999-2000 into a CTE (date_cte_isolate) to reduce store_sales scan early (store_sales accounts for 68% cost). 2. Pushed d_year filter into cross_sales CTE (pushdown) to leverage filtered_date CTE. 3. Optimized main query by removing redundant year conditions (since cross_sales already filtered to 1999-2000) and reordering joins."
