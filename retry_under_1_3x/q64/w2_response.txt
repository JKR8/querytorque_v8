Looking at this query, I can identify several optimization opportunities:

1. **Date CTE Isolation**: The `cross_sales` CTE uses `date_dim` three times (d1, d2, d3) with implicit filters from the main query (`cs1.syear = 1999`, `cs2.syear = 1999 + 1`)
2. **Pushdown**: The main query has filters on `cross_sales` results that can be pushed into the CTE
3. **Dimension CTE Isolation**: Multiple dimension tables have filters that can be isolated

  "explanation": "Applied three optimization techniques: 1) Isolated date_dim filtering into CTEs to reduce join cardinality early, especially filtering store_sales by years 1999-2000 only. 2) Isolated dimension tables into separate CTEs to reduce join size. 3) Pushed down year filters from main query into the cross_sales CTE definition to reduce materialization cost. The biggest gain comes from filtering store_sales early (reducing from 10M to estimated 2M rows) and pushing year filters to avoid full cross_sales materialization."
