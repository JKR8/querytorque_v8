**Key insight:** First CTE filters the dimension (date_dim). Second CTE pre-joins this with the fact table (store_sales). This creates a smaller intermediate result before joining with other dimension tables. The pre-join materializes the filtered fact rows, making subsequent joins faster.

GROUP BY s_store_name, s_store_id
ORDER BY s_store_name, s_store_id, sun_sales, mon_sales, tue_sales, wed_sales, thu_sales, fri_sales, sat_sales

    }

}
```

**Key insight:** Pre-filter BOTH date_dim AND store into separate CTEs. Include only the columns needed for the join and grouping. The optimizer can then use these smaller CTEs efficiently when joining with the fact table.

### Input:

  AND ws1.ws_ship_addr_sk = ca_address_sk
  AND ca_state = 'IL'
  AND ws1.ws_web_site_sk = web_site_sk
  AND web_company_name = 'pri'
  AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM web_sales ws2 WHERE ws1.ws_order_number = ws2.ws_order_number AND ws1.ws_warehouse_sk <> ws2.ws_warehouse_sk)

**Key insight:** Extract the EXISTS subquery into a CTE that finds multi-warehouse orders ONCE. Extract returned orders into another CTE. Join instead of nested EXISTS checks.

- Naming: Use descriptive CTE names (e.g., `filtered_returns` vs `cte1`).
