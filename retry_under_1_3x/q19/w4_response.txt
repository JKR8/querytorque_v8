  "explanation": "Created specialized CTEs for filtered dimension tables (date_dim, item, store, customer_address) to apply filters early before the large join with store_sales. The store_sales scan now joins immediately with filtered_dates (30 rows vs 73K), reducing the 345M row scan to only rows from November 1998. The item filter (i_manager_id=8) reduces 102K rows to 1,836 early. The zip comparison is done on pre-extracted zip prefixes from smaller CTEs rather than computing SUBSTRING on the fly during the large join."
