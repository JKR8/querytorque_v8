  "explanation": "The original query performs sequential scans on large tables (store_returns, customer_demographics) before applying filters. This rewrite pushes down filters early to reduce the working set: (1) Filter customer_address by city first (reduces 750K → 2K rows), (2) Filter income_band by bounds (reduces 20 → 4 rows), (3) Join household_demographics with filtered income_band, (4) Filter customer by address and household_demographics, (5) Filter customer_demographics by join with already-filtered customers, (6) Finally join with store_returns using the much smaller filtered customer_demographics. This reduces the store_returns join from scanning 2.7M rows to joining with a much smaller customer_demographics set."
