  "explanation": "Two complementary rewrites: (1) Materialize filtered dimensions into CTEs (date_dim, store, customer_address, item) to push filters early and avoid repeated joins. The common_sales CTE captures the shared join pattern between promotional and all sales. (2) OR-to-UNION on the promotion channel conditions (p_channel_dmail, p_channel_email, p_channel_tv) to enable focused index usage and avoid scanning promotion table with OR predicates. Exclusion predicates ensure no double-counting."
