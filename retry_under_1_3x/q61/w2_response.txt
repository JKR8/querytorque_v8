  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: 1) Materialize CTEs for all dimension filters (date, address, store, item) to reduce join cardinality early. The base sales CTE pre-joins store_sales with filtered dimensions, avoiding repeated full table scans. 2) Convert OR conditions on promotion channels into UNION subqueries, enabling better predicate pushdown. The rs_01 provides the primary speedup by isolating dimensions; rs_02 provides additional optimization for the OR condition."
