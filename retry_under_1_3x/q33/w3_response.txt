  "explanation": "Applied two complementary optimizations: 1) Multi-dimension prefetch (rs_01) creates CTEs for filtered date_dim, customer_address, and item tables, reducing join cardinality early. This addresses the high-cost SEQ_SCAN on store_sales (78.9% cost). 2) Materialize CTE (rs_02) extracts the repeated Electronics subquery into a shared CTE, eliminating redundant execution. Both preserve the original semantics while dramatically reducing the data processed in joins."
