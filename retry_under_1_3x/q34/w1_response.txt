  "explanation": "rs_01: Decomposed OR conditions on date_dim.d_dom using UNION ALL to enable better predicate pushdown and avoid full table scans. This matches pattern QT-OPT-001. rs_02: Applied early filtering on dimension tables (date_dim, store, household_demographics) before joining with large fact table store_sales, reducing the join size early. This combines patterns QT-OPT-003 and early_filter."
