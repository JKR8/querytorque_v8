  "explanation": "Extracted date range filter into CTE (filtered_dates), pre-filtered manufacturer items into CTE (item_manufacturer_filtered), and decorrelated the subquery by precomputing average discount per item (item_avg_discount) using the filtered dates. This transforms correlated subquery execution into efficient hash joins, reduces repeated date filtering, and allows early filtering of manufacturer items."
