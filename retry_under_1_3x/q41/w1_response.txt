  "explanation": "Converted complex OR condition in correlated subquery to UNION ALL of 8 disjoint branches, precomputing eligible manufacturers in a CTE. This replaces the expensive correlated subquery execution for each row with a single scan using UNION ALL followed by an efficient EXISTS check. The branches are mutually exclusive (different category/color/units/size combinations), ensuring no duplicates without DISTINCT within branches."
