  "explanation": "The original query has a complex correlated subquery with nested OR conditions spanning multiple columns. First, rs_01 applies OR-to-UNION transform to break the OR conditions into 8 separate EXISTS branches with focused predicates, allowing better index usage and early termination. Second, rs_02 consolidates the conditions by category to reduce predicate evaluation overhead while maintaining logical equivalence. The EXISTS (vs COUNT>0) enables semi-join optimization and stops at first match."
