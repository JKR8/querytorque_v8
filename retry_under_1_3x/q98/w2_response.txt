Looking at this query, I can see a clear opportunity for **date_cte_isolate** transformation. The query filters date_dim with a date range condition and joins it with store_sales. By creating a CTE for the filtered dates first, we can reduce the fact table scan early.

  ],
  "explanation": "Created CTEs for filtered date_dim (31 rows) and filtered item tables to reduce the store_sales fact table join early. The filtered_dates CTE isolates the date range filter, allowing store_sales to be joined only to the 31 relevant dates instead of scanning all dates. The filtered_items CTE pre-filters items by category, reducing the item dimension join cardinality. This transforms the three-way join into a sequence of smaller joins, significantly reducing the intermediate result sizes before the expensive aggregation and window function."
