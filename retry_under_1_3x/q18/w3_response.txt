Looking at the query pattern and execution plan, I identify a major optimization opportunity: the fact table (`catalog_sales`) is being scanned without any filters before joining with filtered dimension tables. By applying **multi-dimension prefetch** (similar to QT-OPT-003), we can filter dimension tables first and then join with the fact table, dramatically reducing the number of rows processed in the largest table.

  "explanation": "Created CTEs for all filtered dimension tables (date_dim, customer_demographics cd1, customer, customer_address) to apply filters early and reduce the fact table join size. This changes the join order to start with filtered dimensions, dramatically reducing the rows from catalog_sales that need to be processed. The execution plan shows catalog_sales scan is 51.1% of cost (172M rows), and by joining with filtered dates (365 rows) and other filtered dimensions first, we expect significant reduction in rows processed."
