  "explanation": "Isolated selective dimension filters into separate CTEs to reduce join cardinality early: date_dim (365 rows → from 73,049), customer_demographics for cd1 (1,919,264 rows → from 23M), customer (499,948 rows → from 2.5M), customer_address (249,954 rows → from 750K). This reduces the intermediate hash join sizes by pushing filters before the main join with catalog_sales."
